and floors are made to collect store and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer this is called passive solar design because unlike active solar

without active mechanical systems as contrasted to active solar such technologies convert sunlight into usable heat in water air and thermal mass cause air-movement for ventilating or future use with little use of other energy sources a common example is a solarium on the equator-side of a building passive cooling is the use of the same design principles to reduce summer cooling requirements some passive systems use a small amount of conventional energy to control dampers shutters night insulation and other devices that enhance solar energy collection storage and use and reduce undesirable heat transfer passive solar technologies include direct and indirect solar gain for space heating solar water heating systems based on the thermosiphon use of thermal mass and phase-change materials for slowing indoor air temperature swings solar cookers the solar chimney for enhancing natural ventilation and earth sheltering more widely passive solar technologies include the solar furnace and solar forge but these typically require some external energy for aligning their concentrating mirrors or receivers and historically have not proven to be practical or cost effective for widespread use low-grade energy needs such as space and water heating have proven over time to be better applications for passive use of solar energy as a scienceedit the scientific basis for passive solar building design has been developed from a combination of climatology thermodynamics particularly heat transfer conduction heat convection and electromagnetic radiation fluid mechanicsnatural convection passive movement of air and water without the use of electricity fans or pumps and human thermal comfort based on heat index psychrometrics and enthalpy control for buildings to be inhabited by humans or animals sunrooms solariums and greenhouses for raising plants specific attention is divided into the site location and solar orientation of the building local sun path the prevailing level of insolation latitudesunshinecloudsprecipitation design and construction qualitymaterials placementsizetype of windows and walls and incorporation of solar-energy-storing thermal mass with heat capacity while these considerations may be directed toward any building achieving an ideal optimized costperformance solution requires careful holistic system integration engineering of these scientific principles modern refinements through computer modeling such as the comprehensive us department of energy energy plus 3 building energy simulation software and application of decades of lessons learned since the 1970s energy crisis can achieve significant energy savings and reduction of environmental damage without sacrificing functionality or aesthetics 4 in fact passive-solar design features such as a greenhousesunroomsolarium can greatly enhance the livability daylight views and value of a home at a low cost per unit of space much has been learned about passive solar building design since the 1970s energy crisis many unscientific intuition-based expensive construction experiments have attempted and failed to achieve zero energy - the total elimination of heating-and-cooling energy bills passive solar building construction may not be difficult or expensive using off-the-shelf existing materials and technology but the scientific passive solar building design is a non-trivial engineering effort that requires significant study of previous counter-intuitive lessons learned and time to enter evaluate and iteratively refine the simulation input and output one of the most useful post-construction evaluation tools has been the use of thermography using digital thermal imaging cameras for a formal quantitative scientific energy audit thermal imaging can be used to document areas of poor thermal performance such as the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day the scientific lessons learned over the last three decades have been captured in sophisticated comprehensive building energy simulation computer software systems like us doe energy plus scientific passive solar building design with quantitative cost benefit product optimization is not easy for a novice the level of complexity has resulted in ongoing bad-architecture and many intuition-based unscientific construction experiments that disappoint their designers and waste a significant portion of their construction budget on inappropriate ideascitation needed the economic motivation for scientific design and engineering is significant if it had been applied comprehensively to new building construction beginning in 1980 based on 1970s lessons learned america could be saving over $250,000,000 per year on expensive energy and related pollution todaycitation needed since 1979 passive solar building design has been a critical element of achieving zero energy by educational institution experiments and governments around the world including the us department of energy and the energy research scientists that they have supported for decades the cost effective proof of concept was established decades ago but cultural assimilation into architecture construction trades and building-owner decision making has been very slow and difficult to changecitation needed the new terms architectural science and architectural technology are being added to some schools of architecture with a future goal of teaching the above scientific and energy-engineering principlescitation needed the solar path in passive designedit the ability to achieve these goals simultaneously is fundamentally dependent on the seasonal variations in the suns path throughout the day this occurs as a result of the inclination of the earths axis of rotation in relation to its orbit the sun path is unique for any given latitude in northern hemisphere non-tropical latitudes farther than 23.5 degrees from the equator the sun will reach its highest point toward the south in the direction of the equator as winter solstice approaches the angle at which the sun rises and sets progressively moves further toward the south and the daylight hours will become shorter the opposite is noted in summer where the sun will rise and set further toward the north and the daylight hours will lengthen 5 the converse is observed in the southern hemisphere but the sun rises to the east and sets toward the west regardless of which hemisphere you are in in equatorial regions at less than 23.5 degrees the position of the sun at solar noon will oscillate from north to south and back again during the year 6 in regions closer than 23.5 degrees from either north-or-south pole during summer the sun will trace a complete circle in the sky without setting whilst it will never appear above the horizon six months later during the height of winter 7 the 47-degree difference in the altitude of the sun at solar noon between winter and summer forms the basis of passive solar design this information is combined with local climatic data degree day heating and cooling requirements to determine at what time of the year solar gain will be beneficial for thermal comfort and when it should be blocked with shading by strategic placement of items such as glazing and shading devices the percent of solar gain entering a building can be controlled throughout the year one passive solar sun path design problem is that although the sun is in the same relative position six weeks before and six weeks after the solstice due to thermal lag from the thermal mass of the earth the temperature and solar gain requirements are quite different before and after the summer or winter solstice movable shutters shades shade screens or window quilts can accommodate day-to-day and hour-to-hour solar gain and insulation requirements careful arrangement of rooms completes the passive solar design a common recommendation for residential dwellings is to place living areas facing solar noon and sleeping quarters on the opposite side 8 a heliodon is a traditional movable light device used by architects and designers to help model sun path effects in modern times 3d computer graphics can visually simulate this data and calculate performance predictions 4 passive solar heat transfer principlesedit personal thermal comfort is a function of personal health factors medical psychological sociological and situational ambient air temperature mean radiant temperature air movement wind chill turbulence and relative humidity affecting human evaporative cooling heat transfer in buildings occurs through convection conduction and thermal radiation through roof walls floor and windows 9 convective heat transferedit convective heat transfer can be beneficial or detrimental uncontrolled air infiltration from poor weatherization  weatherstripping  draft-proofing can contribute up to 40 of heat loss during winter 10 however strategic placement of operable windows or vents can enhance convection cross-ventilation and summer cooling when the outside air is of a comfortable temperature and relative humidity 11 filtered energy recovery ventilation systems may be useful to eliminate undesirable humidity dust pollen and microorganisms in unfiltered ventilation air natural convection causing rising warm air and falling cooler air can result in an uneven stratification of heat this may cause uncomfortable variations in temperature in the upper and lower conditioned space serve as a method of venting hot air or be designed in as a natural-convection air-flow loop for passive solar heat distribution and temperature equalization natural human cooling by perspiration and evaporation may be facilitated through natural or forced convective air movement by fans but ceiling fans can disturb the stratified insulating air layers at the top of a room and accelerate heat transfer from a hot attic or through nearby windows in addition high relative humidity inhibits evaporative cooling by humans radiative heat transferedit the main source of heat transfer is radiant energy and the primary source is the sun solar radiation occurs predominantly through the roof and windows but also through walls thermal radiation moves from a warmer surface to a cooler one roofs receive the majority of the solar radiation delivered to a house a cool roof or green roof in addition to a radiant barrier can help prevent your attic from becoming hotter than the peak summer outdoor air temperature 12 see albedo absorptivity emissivity and reflectivity windows are a ready and predictable site for thermal radiation 13 energy from radiation can move into a window in the day time and out of the same window at night radiation uses photons to transmit electromagnetic waves through a vacuum or translucent medium solar heat gain can be significant even on cold clear days solar heat gain through windows can be reduced by insulated glazing shading and orientation windows are particularly difficult to insulate compared to roof and walls convective heat transfer through and around window coverings also degrade its insulation properties 13 when shading windows external shading is more effective at reducing heat gain than internal window coverings 13 western and eastern sun can provide warmth and lighting but are vulnerable to overheating in summer if not shaded in contrast the low midday sun readily admits light and warmth during the winter but can be easily shaded with appropriate length overhangs or angled louvres during summer and leaf bearing summer shade trees which shed their leaves in the fall the amount of radiant heat received is related to the location latitude altitude cloud cover and seasonal  hourly angle of incidence see sun path and lamberts cosine law another passive solar design principle is that thermal energy can be stored in certain building materials and released again when heat gain eases to stabilize diurnal daynight temperature variations the complex interaction of thermodynamic principles can be counterintuitive for first-time designers precise computer modeling can help avoid costly construction experiments site specific considerations during designedit latitude sun path and insolation sunshine seasonal variations in solar gain eg cooling or heating degree days solar insolation humidity diurnal variations in temperature micro-climate details related to breezes humidity vegetation and land contour obstructions  over-shadowing - to solar gain or local cross-winds design elements for residential buildings in temperate climatesedit placement of room-types internal doors and walls and equipment in the house orienting the building to face the equator or a few degrees to the east to capture the morning sun 8 extending the building dimension along the eastwest axis adequately sizing windows to face the midday sun in the winter and be shaded in the summer minimising windows on other sides especially western windows 13 erecting correctly sized latitude-specific roof overhangs 14 or shading elements shrubbery trees trellises fences shutters etc 15 using the appropriate amount and type of insulation including radiant barriers and bulk insulation to minimise seasonal excessive heat gain or loss using thermal mass to store excess solar energy during the winter day which is then re-radiated during the night 16 the precise amount of equator-facing glass and thermal mass should be based on careful consideration of latitude altitude climatic conditions and heatingcooling degree day requirements factors that can degrade thermal performance deviation from ideal orientation and northsoutheastwest aspect ratio excessive glass area over-glazing resulting in overheating also resulting in glare and fading of soft furnishings and heat loss when ambient air temperatures fall installing glazing where solar gain during the day and thermal losses during the night cannot be controlled easily eg west-facing angled glazing skylights 17 thermal losses through non-insulated or unprotected glazing lack of adequate shading during seasonal periods of high solar gain especially on the west wall incorrect application of thermal mass to modulate daily temperature variations open staircases leading to unequal distribution of warm air between upper and lower floors as warm air rises high building surface area to volume - too many corners inadequate weatherization leading to high air infiltration lack of or incorrectly installed radiant barriers during the hot season see also cool roof and green roof insulation materials that are not matched to the main mode of heat transfer eg undesirable convectiveconductiveradiant heat transfer efficiency and economics of passive solar heatingedit technically psh is highly efficient direct-gain systems can utilize ie convert into useful heat 65-70 of the energy of solar radiation that strikes the aperture or collector passive solar fraction psf is the percentage of the required heat load met by psh and hence represents potential reduction in heating costs retscreen international has reported a psf of 20-50 within the field of sustainability energy conservation even of the order of 15 is considered substantial other sources report the following psfs 5-25 for modest systems 40 for highly optimized systems up to 75 for very intense systems in favorable climates such as the southwest united states highly optimized systems can exceed 75 psf 19 for more information see solar air heat key passive solar building design conceptsedit there are six primary passive solar energy configurations 20 direct solar gain indirect solar gain isolated solar gain heat storage insulation and glazing passive cooling direct solar gainedit direct gain attempts to control the amount of direct solar radiation reaching the living space this direct solar gain is a critical part of passive solar house designation as it imparts to a direct gain the cost effectiveness of these configurations are currently being investigated in great detail and are demonstrating promising results 21 indirect solar gainedit indirect gain attempts to control solar radiation reaching an area adjacent but not part of the living space heat enters the building through windows and is captured and stored in thermal mass eg water tank masonry wall and slowly transmitted indirectly to the building through conduction and convection efficiency can suffer from slow response thermal lag and heat losses at night other issues include the cost of insulated glazing and developing effective systems to redistribute heat throughout the living area isolated solar gainedit isolated gain involves utilizing solar energy to passively move heat from or to the living space using a fluid such as water or air by natural convection or forced convection heat gain can occur through a sunspace solarium or solar closet these areas may also be employed usefully as a greenhouse or drying cabinet an equator-side sun room may have its exterior windows higher than the windows between the sun room and the interior living space to allow the low winter sun to penetrate to the cold side of adjacent rooms glass placement and overhangs prevent solar gain during the summer earth cooling tubes or other passive cooling techniques can keep a solarium cool in the summer measures should be taken to reduce heat loss at night eg window coverings or movable window insulation examples thermosiphon barra system double envelope house thermal buffer zone 22 solar space heating system solar chimney heat storageedit the sun doesnt shine all the time heat storage or thermal mass keeps the building warm when the sun cant heat it in diurnal solar houses the storage is designed for one or a few days the usual method is a custom-constructed thermal mass this includes a trombe wall a ventilated concrete floor a cistern water wall or roof pond 23 it is also feasible to use the thermal mass of the earth itself either as-is or by incorporation into the structure by banking or using rammed earth as a structural medium 24 in subarctic areas or areas that have long terms without solar gain eg weeks of freezing fog purpose-built thermal mass is very expensive don stephens pioneered an experimental technique to use the ground as thermal mass large enough for annualized heat storage his designs run an isolated thermosiphon 3m under a house and insulate the ground with a 6m waterproof skirt 25 insulationedit thermal insulation or superinsulation type placement and amount reduces unwanted leakage of heat 9 some passive buildings are actually constructed of insulation special glazing systems and window coveringsedit the effectiveness of direct solar gain systems is significantly enhanced by insulative eg double glazing spectrally selective glazing low-e or movable window insulation window quilts bifold interior insulation shutters shades etc 26 generally equator-facing windows should not employ glazing coatings that inhibit solar gain there is extensive use of super-insulated windows in the german passive house standard selection of different spectrally selective window coating depends on the ratio of heating versus cooling degree days for the design location glazing selectionedit equator-facing glassedit the requirement for vertical equator-facing glass is different from the other three sides of a building reflective window coatings and multiple panes of glass can reduce useful solar gain however direct-gain systems are more dependent on double or triple glazing to reduce heat loss indirect-gain and isolated-gain configurations may still be able to function effectively with only single-pane glazing nevertheless the optimal cost-effective solution is both location and system dependent roof-angle glass  skylightsedit skylights admit harsh direct overhead sunlight and glare 27 either horizontally a flat roof or pitched at the same angle as the roof slope in some cases horizontal skylights are used with reflectors to increase the intensity of solar radiation and harsh glare depending on the roof angle of incidence when the winter sun is low on the horizon most solar radiation reflects off of roof angled glass  the angle of incidence is nearly parallel to roof-angled glass morning and afternoon  when the summer sun is high it is nearly perpendicular to roof-angled glass which maximizes solar gain at the wrong time of year and acts like a solar furnace skylights should be covered and well-insulated to reduce natural convection  warm air rising  heat loss on cold winter nights and intense solar heat gain during hot springsummerfall days the equator-facing side of a building is south in the northern hemisphere and north in the southern hemisphere skylights on roofs that face away from the equator provide mostly indirect illumination except for summer days when the sun may rise on the non-equator side of the building at some latitudes skylights on east-facing roofs provide maximum direct light and solar heat gain in the summer morning west-facing skylights provide afternoon sunlight and heat gain during the hottest part of the day some skylights have expensive glazing that partially reduces summer solar heat gain while still allowing some visible light transmission however if visible light can pass through it so can some radiant heat gain they are both electromagnetic radiation waves you can partially reduce some of the unwanted roof-angled-glazing summer solar heat gain by installing a skylight in the shade of deciduous leaf-shedding trees or by adding a movable insulated opaque window covering on the inside or outside of the skylight this would eliminate the daylight benefit in the summer if tree limbs hang over a roof they will increase problems with leaves in rain gutters possibly cause roof-damaging ice dams shorten roof life and provide an easier path for pests to enter your attic leaves and twigs on skylights are unappealing difficult to clean and can increase the glazing breakage risk in wind storms sawtooth roof glazing with vertical-glass-only can bring some of the passive solar building design benefits into the core of a commercial or industrial building without the need for any roof-angled glass or skylights skylights provide daylight the only view they provide is essentially straight up in most applications well-insulated light tubes can bring daylight into northern rooms without using a skylight a passive-solar greenhouse provides abundant daylight for the equator-side of the building infrared thermography color thermal imaging cameras  used in formal energy audits  can quickly document the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day the us department of energy states vertical glazing is the overall best option for sunspaces 28 roof-angled glass and sidewall glass are not recommended for passive solar sunspaces the us doe explains drawbacks to roof-angled glazing glass and plastic have little structural strength when installed vertically glass or plastic bears its own weight because only a small area the top edge of the glazing is subject to gravity as the glass tilts off the vertical axis however an increased area now the sloped cross-section of the glazing has to bear the force of gravity glass is also brittle it does not flex much before breaking to counteract this you usually must increase the thickness of the glazing or increase the number of structural supports to hold the glazing both increase overall cost and the latter will reduce the amount of solar gain into the sunspace another common problem with sloped glazing is its increased exposure to the weather it is difficult to maintain a good seal on roof-angled glass in intense sunlight hail sleet snow and wind may cause material failure for occupant safety regulatory agencies usually require sloped glass to be made of safety glass laminated or a combination thereof which reduce solar gain potential most of the roof-angled glass on the crowne plaza hotel orlando airport sunspace was destroyed in a single windstorm roof-angled glass increases construction cost and can increase insurance premiums vertical glass is less susceptible to weather damage than roof-angled glass it is difficult to control solar heat gain in a sunspace with sloped glazing during the summer and even during the middle of a mild and sunny winter day skylights are the antithesis of zero energy building passive solar cooling in climates with an air conditioning requirement angle of incident radiationedit the amount of solar gain transmitted through glass is also affected by the angle of the incident solar radiation sunlight striking glass within 20 degrees of perpendicular is mostly transmitted through the glass whereas sunlight at more than 35 degrees from perpendicular is mostly reflected 29 all of these factors can be modeled more precisely with a photographic light meter and a heliodon or optical bench which can quantify the ratio of reflectivity to transmissivity based on angle of incidence alternatively passive solar computer software can determine the impact of sun path and cooling-and-heating degree days on energy performance regional climatic conditions are often available from local weather services operable shading and insulation devicesedit a design with too much equator-facing glass can result in excessive winter spring or fall day heating uncomfortably bright living spaces at certain times of the year and excessive heat transfer on winter nights and summer days although the sun is at the same altitude 6-weeks before and after the solstice the heating and cooling requirements before and after the solstice are significantly different heat storage on the earths surface causes thermal lag variable cloud cover influences solar gain potential this means that latitude-specific fixed window overhangs while important are not a complete seasonal solar gain control solution control mechanisms such as manual-or-motorized interior insulated drapes shutters exterior roll-down shade screens or retractable awnings can compensate for differences caused by thermal lag or cloud cover and help control daily  hourly solar gain requirement variations home automation systems that monitor temperature sunlight time of day and room occupancy can precisely control motorized window-shading-and-insulation devices exterior colors reflecting - absorbingedit materials and colors can be chosen to reflect or absorb solar thermal energy using information on a color for electromagnetic radiation to determine its thermal radiation properties of reflection or absorption can assist the choices see lawrence berkeley national laboratory and oak ridge national laboratory cool colors landscaping and gardensedit energy-efficient landscaping materials for careful passive solar choices include hardscape building material and softscape plants the use of landscape design principles for selection of trees hedges and trellis-pergola features with vines all can be used to create summer shading for winter solar gain it is desirable to use deciduous plants that drop their leaves in the autumn gives year round passive solar benefits non-deciduous evergreen shrubs and trees can be windbreaks at variable heights and distances to create protection and shelter from winter wind chill xeriscaping with mature size appropriate native species of-and drought tolerant plants drip irrigation mulching and organic gardening practices reduce or eliminate the need for energy-and-water-intensive irrigation gas powered garden equipment and reduces the landfill waste footprint solar powered landscape lighting and fountain pumps and covered swimming pools and plunge pools with solar water heaters can reduce the impact of such amenities sustainable gardening sustainable landscaping sustainable landscape architecture other passive solar principlesedit passive solar lightingedit passive solar lighting techniques enhance taking advantage of natural illumination for interiors and so reduce reliance on artificial lighting systems this can be achieved by careful building design orientation and placement of window sections to collect light other creative solutions involve the use of reflecting surfaces to admit daylight into the interior of a building window sections should be adequately sized and to avoid over-illumination can be shielded with a brise soleil awnings well placed trees glass coatings and other passive and active devices 20 another major issue for many window systems is that they can be potentially vulnerable sites of excessive thermal gain or heat loss whilst high mounted clerestory window and traditional skylights can introduce daylight in poorly oriented sections of a building unwanted heat transfer may be hard to control 30 31 thus energy that is saved by reducing artificial lighting is often more than offset by the energy required for operating hvac systems to maintain thermal comfort various methods can be employed to address this including but not limited to window coverings insulated glazing and novel materials such as aerogel semi-transparent insulation optical fiber embedded in walls or roof or hybrid solar lighting at oak ridge national laboratory reflecting elements from active and passive daylighting collectors such as light shelves lighter wall and floor colors mirrored wall sections interior walls with upper glass panels and clear or translucent glassed hinged doors and sliding glass doors take the captured light and passively reflect it further inside the light can be from passive windows or skylights and solar light tubes or from active daylighting sources in traditional japanese architecture the shōji sliding panel doors with translucent washi screens are an original precedent international style modernist and mid-century modern architecture were earlier innovators of this passive penetration and reflection in industrial commercial and residential applications passive solar water heatingedit there are many ways to use solar thermal energy to heat water for domestic use different active-and-passive solar hot water technologies have different location-specific economic cost benefit analysis implications fundamental passive solar hot water heating involves no pumps or anything electrical it is very cost effective in climates that do not have lengthy sub-freezing or very-cloudy weather conditions 32 other active solar water heating technologies etc may be more appropriate for some locations it is possible to have active solar hot water which is also capable of being off grid and qualifies as sustainable this is done by the use of a photovoltaic cell which uses energy from the sun to power the pumpscitation needed comparison to the passive house standard in europeedit there is growing momentum in europe for the approach espoused by the passive house passivhaus in german institute in germany rather than relying solely on traditional passive solar design techniques this approach seeks to make use of all passive sources of heat minimises energy usage and emphasises the need for high levels of insulation reinforced by meticulous attention to detail in order to address thermal bridging and cold air infiltration most of the buildings built to the passive house standard also incorporate an active heat recovery ventilation unit with or without a small typically 1kw incorporated heating component the energy design of passive house buildings is developed using a spreadsheet-based modeling tool called the passive house planning package phpp which is updated periodically the current version is phpp2007 where 2007 is the year of issue a building may be certified as a passive house when it can be shown that it meets certain criteria the most important being that the annual specific heat demand for the house should not exceed 15kwhm2a design toolsedit traditionally a heliodon was used to simulate the altitude and azimuth of the sun shining on a model building at any time of any day of the year 33 in modern times computer programs can model this phenomenon and integrate local climate data including site impacts such as overshadowing and physical obstructions to predict the solar gain potential for a particular building design over the course of a year gps-based smartphone applications can now do this inexpensively on a hand held device these design tools provide the passive solar designer the ability to evaluate local conditions design elements and orientation prior to construction energy performance optimization normally requires an iterative-refinement design-and-evaluate process there is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all universal passive solar building design that would work well in all locations levels of applicationedit many detached suburban houses can achieve reductions in heating expense without obvious changes to their appearance comfort or usability 34 this is done using good siting and window positioning small amounts of thermal mass with good-but-conventional insulation weatherization and an occasional supplementary heat source such as a central radiator connected to a solar water heater sunrays may fall on a wall during the daytime and raise the temperature of its thermal mass this will then radiate heat into the building in the evening external shading or a radiant barrier plus air gap may be used to reduce undesirable summer solar gain an extension of the passive solar approach to seasonal solar capture and storage of heat and cooling these designs attempt to capture warm-season solar heat and convey it to a seasonal thermal store for use months later during the cold season annualised passive solar increased storage is achieved by employing large amounts of thermal mass or earth coupling anecdotal reports suggest they can be effective but no formal study has been conducted to demonstrate their superiority the approach also can move cooling into the warm season examples passive annual heat storage pahs - by john hait annualized geothermal solar ags heating - by don stephen earthed-roof a purely passive solar-heated house would have no mechanical furnace unit relying instead on energy captured from sunshine only supplemented by incidental heat energy given off by lights computers and other task-specific appliances such as those for cooking entertainment etc showering people and pets the use of natural convection air currents rather than mechanical devices such as fans to circulate air is related though not strictly solar design passive solar building design sometimes uses limited electrical and mechanical controls to operate dampers insulating shutters shades awnings or reflectors some systems enlist small fans or solar-heated chimneys to improve convective air-flow a reasonable way to analyse these systems is by measuring their coefficient of performance a heat pump might use 1 j for every 4 j it delivers giving a cop of 4 a system that only uses a 30 w fan to more-evenly distribute 10kw of solar heat through an entire house would have a cop of 300 passive solar building design is often a foundational element of a cost-effective zero energy building 35 36 although a zeb uses multiple passive solar building design concepts a zeb is usually not purely passive having active mechanical renewable energy generation systems such as wind turbine photovoltaics micro hydro geothermal and other emerging alternative energy sources passive solar design on skyscrapersedit there has been recent interest in the utilization of the large amounts of surface area on skyscrapers to improve their overall energy efficiency because skyscrapers are increasingly ubiquitous in urban environments yet require large amounts of energy to operate there is potential for large amounts of energy savings employing passive solar design techniques one study 37 which analyzed the proposed 22 bishopsgate tower in london found that a 35 energy decrease in demand can theoretically be achieved through indirect solar gains by rotating the building to achieve optimum ventilation and daylight penetration usage of high thermal mass flooring material to decrease temperature fluctuation inside the building and using double or triple glazed low emissivity window glass for direct solar gain indirect solar gain techniques included moderating wall heat flow by variations of wall thickness from 20 to 30cm using window glazing on the outdoor space to prevent heat loss dedicating 15-20 of floor area for thermal storage and implementing a trombe wall to absorb heat entering the space overhangs are used to block direct sunlight in the summer and allow it in the winter and heat reflecting blinds are inserted between the thermal wall and the glazing to limit heat build-up in the summer months another study 38 analyzed double-green skin facade dgsf on the outside of high rise buildings in hong kong such a green facade or vegetation covering the outer walls can combat the usage of air conditioning greatly - as much as 80 as discovered by the researchers in more temperate climates strategies such as glazing adjustment of window-to-wall ratio sun shading and roof strategies can offer considerable energy savings in the 30 to 60 range 39 see alsoedit renewable energy portal energy portal sustainable development portal site analysis architecture 2030 daylighting energy plus house list of low-energy building
