used eg sea carriers are often governed by quite different rules from road carriers or railway carriers in common law jurisdictions as well as under international law a common carrier is absolutely liable 6 for goods carried by it with four exceptions 7 an act of nature an act of the public enemies fault or fraud by the shipper an inherent defect in the goods a sea carrier may also according to the hague-visby rules escape liability on other grounds than the above-mentioned eg a sea carrier is not liable for damages to the goods if the damage is the result of a fire on board the ship or the result of a navigational error committed by the ships master or other crewmember carriers typically incorporate further exceptions into a contract of carriage often specifically claiming not to be a common carrier an important legal requirement for common carrier as public provider is that it cannot discriminate that is refuse the service unless there is some compelling reason as of 2007 the

excludes his duty to take care eg by a condition that the passenger travels at his own risk against all casualties cannot be pronounced to be unreasonable if the law authorises it there was nothing in
