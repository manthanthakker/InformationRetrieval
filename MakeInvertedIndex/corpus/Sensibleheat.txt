sensible heat sensible heat is heat exchanged by a body or thermodynamic system in which the exchange of heat changes the temperature of the body or system and some macroscopic variables of the body or system but leaves unchanged certain other macroscopic variables of the body or system such as volume or pressure 1 2 3 4 usageedit classical statistical chemical equilibrium non-equilibrium zeroth first second third equation of state ideal gas real gas state of matter equilibrium control volume instruments isobaric isochoric isothermal adiabatic isentropic isenthalpic quasistatic polytropic free expansion reversibility irreversibility endoreversibility heat engines heat pumps thermal efficiency property diagrams intensive and extensive properties temperature entropyintroduction pressure volume chemical potential particle number vapor quality reduced properties work heat property databases carnots theorem clausius theorem fundamental relation ideal gas law maxwell relations onsager reciprocal relations bridgmans equations table of thermodynamic equations free energy free entropy internal energy u  s  v  displaystyle usv enthalpy h  s  p   u  p v displaystyle hspupv helmholtz free energy a  t  v   u  t s displaystyle atvu-ts gibbs free energy g  t  p   h  t s displaystyle gtph-ts history culture general heat entropy gas laws perpetual motion machines entropy and time entropy and life brownian ratchet maxwells demon heat death paradox loschmidts paradox synergetics caloric theory theory of heat vis viva living force mechanical equivalent of heat motive power an experimental enquiry concerning  heat on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances reflections on the motive power of fire thermodynamics heat engines art education maxwells thermodynamic surface entropy as energy dispersal bernoulli carnot clapeyron clausius carathéodory duhem gibbs von helmholtz joule maxwell von mayer onsager rankine smeaton stahl thompson thomson waterston v t e the term is used in contrast to a latent heat which is the amount of heat exchanged that is hidden meaning it occurs without change of temperature for example during a phase change such as the melting of ice the temperature of the system containing the ice and the liquid is constant until all ice has melted the terms latent and sensible are correlative that means that they are defined as a pair depending on which other macroscopic variables are held constant during the process the sensible heat of a thermodynamic process may be calculated as the product of the bodys mass m with its specific heat capacity c and the change in temperature  δ t displaystyle delta t  sensible heat and latent heat are not special forms of energy rather they describe exchanges of heat under conditions specified in terms of their effect on a material or a thermodynamic system in the writings of the early scientists who provided the foundations of thermodynamics sensible heat had a clear meaning in calorimetry james prescott joule characterized it in 1847 as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer 5 both sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes while transporting energy in nature latent heat is associated with changes of state measured at constant temperature especially the phase changes of atmospheric water vapor mostly vaporization and condensation whereas sensible heat directly affects the temperature of the atmosphere in meteorology the term sensible heat flux means the conductive heat flux from the earths surface to the atmosphere 6 it is an important component of earths surface energy budget sensible heat flux is commonly measured with the eddy covariance method see alsoedit enthalpy thermodynamic databases for pure substances eddy covariance flux eddy correlation eddy flux referencesedit
