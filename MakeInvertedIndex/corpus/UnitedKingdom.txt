of england and scotland were united into one kingdom by the name of great britain though the new state is also referred to in the acts as the kingdom of great britain united kingdom of great britain and united kingdom 28 29note 12 however the term united kingdom is only found in informal use during the 18th century and the country was only occasionally referred to as the united kingdom of great britainits full official name from 1707 to 1800 being merely great britain without a long form 30 31 32 33 34 the acts of union 1800 united the kingdom of great britain and the kingdom of ireland in 1801 forming the united kingdom of great britain and ireland the name united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland was adopted following the independence of the irish free state and the partition of ireland in 1922 which left northern ireland as the only part of the island of ireland within the uk 35 although the united kingdom as a sovereign state is a country england scotland wales and to a lesser degree northern ireland are also regarded as countries though they are not sovereign states 36 37 scotland wales and northern ireland have devolved self-government 38 39 the british prime ministers website has used the phrase countries within a country to describe the united kingdom 16 some statistical summaries such as those for the twelve nuts 1 regions of the uk also refer to scotland wales and northern ireland as regions 40 41 northern ireland is also referred to as a province 42 43 with regard to northern ireland the descriptive name used can be controversial with the choice often revealing ones political preferences 44 the term britain is often used as synonym for the united kingdom the term great britain by contrast refers conventionally to the island of great britain or politically to england scotland and wales in combination 45 46 47 however it is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the united kingdom as a whole 48 49 gb and gbr are the standard country codes for the united kingdom see iso 3166-2 and iso 3166-1 alpha-3 and are consequently used by international organisations to refer to the united kingdom additionally the united kingdoms olympic team competes under the name great britain or team gb 50 51 the adjective british is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the united kingdom the term has no definite legal connotation but is used in law to refer to uk citizenship and matters to do with nationality 52 people of the united kingdom use a number of different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being british or as being english scottish welsh northern irish or irish 53 or as being both 54 in 2006 a new design of british passport was introduced its first page shows the long form name of the

government websites 56 however it is usually abbreviated to du for the mutated form y deyrnas unedig in scottish gaelic the long form is rìoghachd aonaichte bhreatainn is èireann a tuath and the short form rìoghachd aonaichte history before 1707 settlement by anatomically modern humans of what was to become the united kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago 57 by the end of the regions prehistoric period the population is thought to have belonged in the main to a culture termed insular celtic comprising brythonic britain and gaelic ireland 58 the roman conquest beginning in 43 ad and the 400-year rule of southern britain was followed by an invasion by germanic anglo-saxon settlers reducing the brythonic area mainly to what was to become wales and the historic kingdom of strathclyde 59 most of the region settled by the anglo-saxons became unified as the kingdom of england in the 10th century 60 meanwhile gaelic-speakers in north west britain with connections to the north-east of ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century 61 62 united with the picts to create the kingdom of scotland in the 9th century 63 in 1066 the normans invaded england from france and after its conquest seized large parts of wales conquered much of ireland and were invited to settle in scotland bringing to each country feudalism on the northern french model and norman-french culture 64 the norman elites greatly influenced but eventually assimilated with each of the local cultures 65 subsequent medieval english kings completed the conquest of wales and made an unsuccessful attempt to annex scotland following the declaration of arbroath scotland maintained its independence albeit in near-constant conflict with england the english monarchs through inheritance of substantial territories in france and claims to the french crown were also heavily involved in conflicts in france most notably the hundred years war while the kings of scots were in an alliance with the french during this period 66 the early modern period saw religious conflict resulting from the reformation and the introduction of protestant state churches in each country 67 wales was fully incorporated into the kingdom of england 68 and ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the english crown 69 in what was to become northern ireland the lands of the independent catholic gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to protestant settlers from england and scotland 70 in 1603 the kingdoms of england scotland and ireland were united in a personal union when james vi king of scots inherited the crowns of england and ireland and moved his court from edinburgh to london each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political legal and religious institutions 71 72 in the mid-17th century all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars including the english civil war which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the commonwealth of england scotland and ireland 73 74 during the 17th and 18th centuries british sailors were involved in acts of piracy privateering attacking and stealing from ships off the coast of europe and the caribbean 75 although the monarchy was restored the interregnum ensured with the glorious revolution of 1688 and the subsequent bill of rights 1689 and the claim of right act 1689 that unlike much of the rest of europe royal absolutism would not prevail and a professed catholic could never accede to the throne the british constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system 76 with the founding of the royal society in 1660 science was greatly encouraged during this period particularly in england the development of naval power and the interest in voyages of discovery led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies particularly in north america 77 78 after the acts of union of 1707 on 1 may 1707 the united kingdom of great britain came into being the result of acts of union being passed by the parliaments of england and scotland to ratify the 1706 treaty of union and so unite the two kingdoms 79 80 81 in the 18th century cabinet government developed under robert walpole in practice the first prime minister  1721–1742 a series of jacobite uprisings sought to remove the protestant house of hanover from the british throne and restore the catholic house of stuart the jacobites were finally defeated at the battle of culloden in 1746 after which the scottish highlanders were brutally suppressed the british colonies in north america that broke away from britain in the american war of independence became the united states of america recognised by britain in 1783 british imperial ambition turned elsewhere particularly to india 82 during the 18th century britain was involved in the atlantic slave trade british ships transported an estimated 2 million slaves from africa to the west indies before banning the trade in 1807 banning slavery in 1833 and taking a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide by pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties and then formed the worlds oldest international human rights organisation anti-slavery international in london in 1839 83 84 85 the term united kingdom became official in 1801 when the parliaments of britain and ireland each passed an act of union uniting the two kingdoms and creating the united kingdom of great britain and ireland 86 in the early 19th century the british-led industrial revolution began to transform the country gradually political power shifted away from the old tory and whig landowning classes towards the new industrialists an alliance of merchants and industrialists with the whigs would lead to a new party the liberals with an ideology of free trade and laissez-faire in 1832 parliament passed the great reform act which began the transfer of political power from the aristocracy to the middle classes in the countryside enclosure of the land was driving small farmers out towns and cities began to swell with a new urban working class few ordinary workers had the vote and they created their own organisations in the form of trade unionscitation needed

british empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman 88 89 90 91 by the time of the great exhibition of 1851 britain was described as the workshop of the world 92 the british empire was expanded to include india large parts of africa and many other territories throughout the world alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies british dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions such as asia and latin america 93 94 domestically political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise during the century the population increased at a dramatic rate accompanied by rapid urbanisation causing significant social and economic stresses 95 to seek new markets and sources of raw materials the conservative party under disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in egypt south africa and elsewhere canada australia and new zealand became self-governing dominions 96 after the turn of the century the uks industrial monopoly was challenged by germany and the united statescitation needed social reform and home rule for ireland were important domestic issues after 1900 the labour party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups in 1900 and suffragettes campaigned for womens right to vote

great disruption in the social ordercitation needed after the war the uk received the league of nations mandate over a number of former german and ottoman colonies the british empire reached its greatest extent covering a fifth of the worlds land surface and a quarter of its population 100 however the uk had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt 99 the rise of irish nationalism and disputes within ireland over the terms of irish home rule led eventually to the partition of the island in 1921 101 the irish free state became independent with dominion status in 1922 northern ireland remained part of the united kingdom 102 a wave of strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the uk general strike of 1926 the uk had still not recovered from the effects of the war when the great depression  1929–32 occurred this led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas as well as political and social unrest in the 1930s with rising membership in communist and socialist parties a coalition government was formed in 1931 103 the uk entered world war ii by declaring war on germany in 1939 after the nazis had invaded poland and

decades 107 major industries and public utilities were nationalised a welfare state was established and a comprehensive publicly funded healthcare system the national health service was created 108 the rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with britains now much-diminished economic position so that a policy of decolonisation was unavoidable independence was granted to india and pakistan in 1947 109 over the next three decades most colonies of the british empire gained their independence many became members of the commonwealth of nations 110 although the uk was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal with its first atomic bomb test in 1952 the new post-war limits of britains international role were illustrated by the suez crisis of 1956 the international spread of the english language ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture 111 112 as a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s the government encouraged immigration from commonwealth countries in the following decades the uk became a more multi-ethnic society than before 113 despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s the uks economic performance was

conventionally known as the troubles it is usually considered to have ended with the belfast good friday agreement of 1998 116 117 118 following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s the conservative government of the 1980s under margaret thatcher initiated a radical policy of monetarism deregulation particularly of the financial sector for example big bang in 1986 and labour markets the sale of state-owned companies privatisation and the withdrawal of subsidies to others 119 this resulted in high unemployment and social unrest but ultimately also economic growth particularly in the services sector from 1984 the economy was helped by the inflow of substantial north sea oil revenues 120 around the end of the 20th century there were major changes to the governance of the uk with the establishment of devolved administrations for scotland wales and northern ireland 121 the statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the european convention on human rights the uk is still a key global player diplomatically and militarily it plays leading roles in the eu un and nato however controversy surrounds some of britains overseas military deployments particularly in afghanistan and iraq 122 the 2008 global financial crisis severely affected the uk economy the coalition government of 2010 introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public deficits which resulted 123 in 2014 the scottish government held a referendum on scottish independence with 55 of voters rejecting the independence proposal and opting to remain

including nearly eight hundred islands 136 predominantly west and north of the mainland notably the hebrides orkney islands and shetland islands scotland is the most mountainous country in the uk and its topography is distinguished by the highland boundary faulta geological rock fracturewhich traverses scotland from arran in the west to stonehaven in the east 137 the faultline separates two distinctively different regions namely the highlands to the north and west and the lowlands to the south and east the more rugged highland region contains the majority of scotlands mountainous land including ben nevis which at 1,343 metres  4,406ft is the highest point in the british isles 138 lowland areasespecially the narrow waist of land between the firth of clyde and the firth of forth known as the central beltare flatter and home to most of the population including glasgow scotlands largest city and edinburgh its capital and political centre although upland and mountainous terrain lies within the southern uplands wales accounts for less than a tenth of the total area of the uk covering 20,779 square kilometres  8,020sqmi 139 wales is mostly mountainous though south wales is less mountainous than north and mid wales the main population and industrial areas are in south wales consisting of the coastal cities of cardiff swansea and newport and the south wales valleys to

above 35c  95f 141 the prevailing wind is from the south-west and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the atlantic ocean 129 although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest atlantic currents warmed by the gulf stream bring mild winters 142 especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground summers are warmest in the south-east of england being closest to the european mainland and coolest in the north heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills administrative divisions there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the united kingdom 143 each country of the united kingdom has its own arrangements whose origins often pre-date the uks formation until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function 144 most significantly the devolution of powers to scotland wales and northern ireland the organisation of local government in england is complex with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements legislation concerning local government in england is the responsibility of the uks parliament and the government as england has no devolved legislature the upper-tier subdivisions of england are the nine regions now used primarily for statistical purposes 145 one region greater london has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a referendum 146 it was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected regional assemblies but a proposed assembly in the north east region was rejected by a referendum in 2004 147 below the regional tier some parts of england have county councils and district councils and others have unitary authorities while london consists of 32 london boroughs and the city of london councillors are elected by the first-past-the-post system in single-member wards or by the multi-member plurality system in multi-member wards 148 for local government purposes scotland is divided into 32 council areas with wide variation in both size and population the cities of glasgow edinburgh aberdeen and dundee are separate council areas as is the highland council which includes a third of scotlands area but only just over 200,000people local councils are made up of elected

falkland islands in 2013 161 the crown dependencies are possessions of the crown as opposed to overseas territories of the uk 162 they comprise three independently administered jurisdictions the channel islands of jersey and guernsey in the english channel and the isle of man in the irish sea by mutual agreement the british government manages the islands foreign affairs and defence and the uk parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf however internationally they are regarded as territories for which the united kingdom is responsible 163 the power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies with the assent of the crown privy council or in the case of the isle of man in certain circumstances the lieutenant-governor 164 since 2005 each crown dependency has had a chief minister as its head of government 165 the british dependencies use a varied assortment of currencies these include the british pound us dollar new zealand dollar euro or their own currencies which may be pegged to either politics the united kingdom is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy queen elizabeth ii is the head of state of the uk as well as monarch of fifteen other independent commonwealth countries the monarch has the right to be consulted the right to encourage and the right to warn 166 the constitution of the united kingdom is uncodified and consists mostly of a collection of disparate written sources including statutes judge-made case law and international treaties together with constitutional conventions 167 as there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and constitutional law the uk parliament can perform constitutional reform simply by passing acts of parliament and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution however no parliament can pass laws that future parliaments cannot change 168 government the uk has a parliamentary government based on the westminster system that has been emulated around the world a legacy of the british empire the parliament of the united kingdom meets in the palace of westminster and has two houses an elected house of commons and an appointed house of lords all bills passed are given royal assent before becoming law the position of prime ministernote 13 the uks head of government 169 belongs to the person most likely to command the confidence of the house of commons this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber the prime minister chooses a cabinet and its members are formally appointed by the monarch to form her majestys government by convention the monarch respects the prime ministers decisions of government 170 the cabinet is traditionally drawn from members of the prime ministers party or coalition and mostly from the house of commons but always from both legislative houses the cabinet being responsible to both executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet all of whom are sworn into the privy council of the united kingdom and become ministers of the crown the current prime minister is theresa may who has been in office since 13 july 2016 may is also the leader of the conservative party for elections to the house of commons the uk is divided into 650 constituencies 171 each electing a single member of parliament mp by simple plurality general elections are called by the monarch when the prime minister so advises prior to the fixed-term parliaments act 2011 the parliament acts 1911 and 1949 required that a new election must be called no later than five years after the previous general election 172 the conservative party the labour party and the liberal democrats formerly as the liberal party have in modern times been considered the uks three major political parties 173 representing the british traditions of conservatism socialism and social liberalism respectively however at the 2015 general election the scottish national party became the third-largest party by number of seats won ahead of the liberal democrats most of the remaining seats were won by parties that contest elections only in one part of the uk plaid cymru wales only and the democratic unionist party ulster unionist party social democratic and labour party and sinn féin northern ireland onlynote 14 174 in accordance with party policy no elected sinn féin members of parliament have ever attended the house of commons to speak on behalf of their constituents because of the requirement to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch 175 devolved administrations scotland wales and northern ireland each have their own government or executive led by a first minister or in the case of northern ireland a diarchal first minister and deputy first minister and a devolved unicameral legislature england the largest country of the united kingdom has no such devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the uks government and parliament on all issues this situation has given rise to the so-called west lothian question which concerns the fact that members of parliament from scotland wales and northern ireland can vote sometimes decisively 176 on matters that only affect england 177 the mckay commission reported on this matter in march 2013 recommending that laws affecting only england should need support from a majority of english members of parliament 178 the scottish government and parliament have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the uk parliament including education healthcare scots law and local government 179 at the 2011 elections the scottish national party won re-election and achieved an overall majority in the scottish parliament with its leader alex salmond as first minister of scotland 180 181 in 2012 the uk and scottish governments signed the edinburgh agreement setting out the terms for a referendum on scottish independence in 2014 which was defeated 55 to 45 the welsh government and the national assembly for wales have more limited powers than those devolved to scotland 182 the assembly is able to legislate on devolved matters through acts of the assembly which require no prior consent from westminster the 2011 elections resulted in a minority labour administration led by carwyn jones 183 the northern ireland executive and assembly have powers similar to those devolved to scotland the executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the assembly arlene foster democratic unionist party and martin mcguinness sinn féin are first minister and deputy first minister respectively 184 devolution to northern ireland is contingent on participation by the northern ireland administration in the north-south ministerial council where the northern ireland executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the government of ireland the british and irish governments co-operate on non-devolved matters affecting northern ireland through the britishirish intergovernmental conference which assumes the responsibilities of the northern ireland administration in the event of its non-operation the uk does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to scotland wales or northern ireland under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty the uk parliament could in theory therefore abolish the scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly 185 186 indeed in 1972 the uk parliament unilaterally prorogued the parliament of northern ireland setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions 187 in practice it would be politically difficult for the uk parliament to abolish devolution to the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly given the political entrenchment created by referendum decisions 188 the political constraints placed upon the uk parliaments power to interfere with devolution in northern ireland are even greater than in relation to scotland and wales given that devolution in northern ireland rests upon an international agreement with the government of ireland 189 law and criminal justice the united kingdom does not have a single legal system as article 19 of the 1706 treaty of union provided for the continuation of scotlands separate legal system 190 today the uk has three distinct systems of law english law northern ireland law and scots law a new supreme court of the united kingdom came into being in october 2009 to replace the appellate committee of the house of lords 191 192 the judicial committee of the privy council including the same members as the supreme court is the highest court of appeal for several independent commonwealth countries the british overseas territories and the crown dependencies 193 both english law which applies in england and wales and northern ireland law are based on common-law principles 194 the essence of common law is that subject to statute the law is developed by judges in courts applying statute precedent and common sense to the facts before them to give explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles which are reported and binding in future similar cases stare decisis 195 the courts of england and wales are headed by the senior courts of england and wales consisting of the court of appeal the high court of justice for civil cases and the crown court for criminal cases the supreme court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in england wales and northern ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions 196 scots law is a hybrid system based on both common-law and civil-law principles the chief courts are the court of session for civil cases 197 and the high court of justiciary for criminal cases 198 the supreme court of the united kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under scots law 199 sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury known as sheriff solemn court or with a sheriff and no jury known as sheriff summary court 200 the scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts for a criminal trial guilty not guilty and not proven both not guilty and not proven result in an acquittal 201 crime in england and wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995 though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 66 in recorded crime from 1995 to 2015 202 according to crime statistics the prison population of england and wales has increased to 86,000 giving england and wales the highest rate of incarceration in western europe at 148 per 100,000 203 204 her majestys prison service which reports to the ministry of justice manages most of the prisons within england and wales the murder rate in england and wales has stabilised in the first half of the 2010s with a murder rate around 1 per 100,000 which is half the peak in 2002 and similar to the rate in the 1980s 205unreliable source more sexual offences have been reported to the police since 2002 206 207 crime in scotland fell slightly in 2014/2015 to its lowest level in 39 years in with 59 killings for a murder rate of 1.1 per 100,000 scotlands prisons are overcrowded but the prison population is shrinking 208 foreign relations the uk is a permanent member of the united nations security council a member of nato the commonwealth of nations the g7 finance ministers the g7 forum previously the g8 forum the g20 the oecd the wto the council of europe the osce and is a member state of the european union the uk is said to have a special relationship with the united states and a close partnership with francethe entente cordialeand shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries 209 210 the uk is also closely linked with the republic of ireland the two countries share a common travel area and co-operate through the british-irish intergovernmental conference and the british-irish council britains global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations foreign investments official development assistance and military engagements 211 military the armed forces of the united kingdomofficially her majestys armed forcesconsist of three professional service branches the royal navy and royal marines forming the naval service the british army and the royal air force 212 the forces are managed by the ministry of defence and controlled by the defence council chaired by the secretary of state for defence the commander-in-chief is the british monarch elizabeth ii to whom members of the forces swear an oath of allegiance 213 the armed forces are charged with protecting the uk and its overseas territories promoting the uks global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts they are active and regular participants in nato including the allied rapid reaction corps as well as the five power defence arrangements rimpac and other worldwide coalition operations overseas garrisons and facilities are maintained in ascension island belize brunei canada cyprus diego garcia the falkland islands germany gibraltar kenya qatar and singapore 214 215 the british armed forces played a key role in establishing the british empire as the dominant world power in the 18th 19th and early 20th centuries throughout its unique history the british forces have seen action in a number of major wars such as the seven years war the napoleonic wars the crimean war world war i and world war iias well as many colonial conflicts by emerging victorious from such conflicts britain has often been able to decisively influence world events since the end of the british empire the uk has nonetheless remained a major military power following the end of the cold war defence policy has a stated assumption that the most demanding operations will be undertaken as part of a coalition 216 setting aside the intervention in sierra leone recent uk military operations in bosnia kosovo afghanistan iraq and most recently libya have followed this approach the last time the british military fought alone was the falklands war of 1982 according to various sources including the stockholm international peace research institute and the international institute for strategic studies the united kingdom has the fourth- or fifth-highest military expenditure in the world total defence spending amounts to 2.0 of national gdp 26 27 economy overview the uk has a partially regulated market economy 217 based on market exchange rates the uk is today the fifth-largest economy in the world and the second-largest in europe after germany hm treasury led by

227 228 the creative industries accounted for 7 gva in 2005 and grew at an average of 6 per annum between 1997 and 2005 229 the industrial revolution started in the uk with an initial concentration on the textile industry 230 followed by other heavy industries such as shipbuilding coal mining and steelmaking 231 232 british merchants shippers and bankers developed overwhelming advantage over those of other nations allowing the uk to dominate international trade in the 19th century 233 234 as other nations industrialised coupled with economic decline after two world wars the united kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined by degrees throughout the 20th century manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy but accounted for only 16.7 of national output in 2003 235 the automotive industry is a significant part of the uk manufacturing sector and employs around 800,000 people with a turnover in 2015 of some £70 billion generating £34.6 billion of exports  11.8 of the uks total export goods in 2015 the uk produced around 1.6 million passenger vehicles and 94,500 commercial vehicles the uk is a major centre for engine manufacturing and in

2 november 2015 bae systems announced they have bought a 20 stake in reaction engines ltd the working partnership will draw on bae systems extensive aerospace technology development and project management expertise and will provide reaction engines with access to critical industrial technical and capital resources to help progress the development of the sabre engine 244 the pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in the uk economy and the country has the third-highest share of global pharmaceutical rd expenditures after the united states and japan 245 246 agriculture is intensive highly mechanised and efficient by european standards producing about 60 of food needs with less than 1.6 of the labour force  535,000 workers 247 around two-thirds of production is devoted to livestock one-third to arable crops farmers are subsidised by the eus common agricultural policy the uk retains a significant though much reduced fishing industry it is also rich in a number of natural resources including coal petroleum natural gas tin limestone iron ore salt clay chalk gypsum lead silica and an abundance of arable landcitation needed in the final quarter of 2008 as a result of the great recession the uk economy officially entered recession for the first time since 1991 248 unemployment increased from 5.2 in may 2008 to 7.6 in may 2009 and by january 2012 the unemployment rate among 18- to 24-year-olds had risen from 11.9 to 22.5 the highest since current records began in 1992 although it had fallen to 14.2 by november 2015 249 250 251 total uk government debt rose quickly from 44.4 of gdp in 2007 to 82.9 of gdp in 2011 then increased more slowly to 87.5 of gdp in 2015 252 253 following the likes of the united states france and many major economies in february 2013 the uk lost its top aaa credit rating for the first time since 1978 with moodys and fitch credit agency while unlike the other major economies retained their triple a rating with the largest agency standard  poors 254 255 however by the end of 2014 uk growth was the fastest in both the g7 and in europe 256 257 and by september 2015 the unemployment rate was down to a seven-year low of 5.3 258 as a direct result of the great recession between 2010 and the third quarter of 2012 wages in the uk fell by 3.2 259 but by 2015 real wages were growing by 3 having grown faster than inflation since 2014 260 since the 1980s uk economic inequality like canada australia and the united states has grown faster than in other developed countries 261 262 the poverty line in the uk is commonly defined as being 60 of the median household incomenote 15 in 2007–2008 13.5million people or 22 of the population lived below this line this is a higher level of relative poverty than all but four other eu members 263 in the same year 4.0million children 31 of the total lived in households below the poverty line after housing costs were taken into account this is a decrease of 400,000 children

after the us which has an external debt of 18.5 trillion dollars as a percentage of gdp external debt is 408 which is third highest in the world after luxembourg and iceland 269 270 271 272 273 the combination of the uks relatively lax regulatory regime and londons financial institutions providing sophisticated methods to launder proceeds from criminal activity around the world including those from drug trade makes the city of london a global hub for illicit finance and the uk a safe haven for the worlds major-league tax dodgers according to research papers and reports published in the mid-2010s 274 275 276 277 278 the reports on the panama papers published in april 2016 singled out the uk as being at the heart of super-rich tax-avoidance network 279 science and technology england and scotland were leading centres of the scientific revolution from the 17th century 280 and the united kingdom led the industrial revolution from the 18th century 230 and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances 281 major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include isaac newton whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science 282 from the 19th century charles darwin whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology and james clerk maxwell who formulated classical electromagnetic theory and more recently stephen hawking who has advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes 283 major scientific discoveries from the 18th century include hydrogen by henry cavendish 284 from the 20th century penicillin by alexander fleming 285 and the structure of dna by francis crick and others 286 famous british engineers and inventors of the industrial revolution include james watt george stephenson richard arkwright robert stephenson and isambard kingdom brunel 287 other major engineering projects and applications by people from the uk include the steam locomotive developed by richard trevithick and andrew vivian 288 from the 19th century the electric motor by michael faraday the incandescent light bulb by joseph swan 289 and the first practical telephone patented by alexander graham bell 290 and in the 20th century the worlds first working television system by john logie baird and others 291 the jet engine by frank whittle the basis of the modern computer by alan turing and the world wide web by tim berners-lee 292 scientific research and development remains important in british universities with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry 293 between 2004 and 2008 the uk produced 7 of the worlds scientific research papers and had an 8 share of scientific citations the third and second highest in the world after the united states and china respectively 294 scientific journals produced in the uk include nature the british medical journal and the lancet 295 transport a radial road network totals 29,145 miles  46,904km of main roads 2,173 miles  3,497km of motorways and 213,750 miles  344,000km of paved roads 129

network was privatised between 1994 and 1997 which was followed by a rapid rise in passenger numbers following years of decline although the factors behind this are disputed network rail owns and manages most of the fixed assets tracks signals etc about 20 privately owned train operating companies operate passenger trains which carried 1.68 billion passengers in 2015 300 301 there are also some 1,000 freight trains in daily operationwhen 129 the british government is to spend £30 billion on a new high-speed railway line hs2 to be operational by 2026 302 crossrail under construction in london is europes largest construction project with a £15 billion projected cost 303 304 in the year from october 2009 to september 2010 uk airports handled a total of 211.4million passengers 305 in that period the three largest airports were london heathrow airport  65.6million passengers gatwick airport  31.5million passengers and london stansted airport  18.9million passengers 305 london

well as virgin atlantic 306 energy in 2006 the uk was the worlds ninth-largest consumer of energy and the 15th-largest producer 307 the uk is home to a number of large energy companies including two of the six oil and gas supermajorsbp and royal dutch shelland bg group 308 309 in 2011 40 of the uks electricity was produced by gas 30 by coal 19 by nuclear power and 4.2 by wind hydro biofuels and wastes 310 in 2013 the uk produced 914thousand barrels per day bbld of oil and consumed 1,507thousand bbld 311 312 production is now in decline and the uk has been a net importer of oil since 2005 313 in 2010update the uk had around 3.1billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves the largest of any eu member state 313 in 2009 66.5 of the uks oil supply was imported 314 in 2009 the uk was the 13th-largest producer of natural gas in the world and the largest producer in the eu 315 production is now in decline and the uk has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004 315 in 2009 half of british gas was supplied from imports as domestic reserves are depleted 310 coal production played a key role in the uk economy in the 19th and 20th centuries in the mid-1970s 130 million tonnes of coal was being produced annually not falling below 100 million tonnes until the early 1980s during the 1980s and 1990s the industry was scaled back considerably in 2011 the uk produced 18.3 million tonnes of coal 316 in 2005 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 171million tons 316 the uk coal authority has stated there is a potential to produce between 7billion tonnes and 16billion tonnes of coal through underground coal gasification ucg or fracking 317 and that based on current uk coal consumption such reserves could last between 200 and 400 years 318 however environmental and social concerns have been raised over chemicals getting into the water table and minor earthquakes damaging homes 319 320 in the late 1990s nuclear power plants contributed around 25 of total annual electricity generation in the uk but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down and ageing-related problems affect plant availability in 2012 the uk had 16 reactors normally generating about 19 of its electricity all but one of the reactors will be retired by 2023 unlike germany and japan the uk intends to build a new generation of nuclear plants from about 2018 310 the total of all renewable electricity sources provided for 14.9 of the electricity generated in the united kingdom in 2013 321 reaching 53.7 twh of electricity generated the uk is one of the best sites in europe for wind energy and wind power production is its fastest growing supply in 2014 it generated 9.3 of the uks total electricity 322 323 324 water supply and sanitation access to improved water supply and sanitation in the uk is universal it is estimated that 96.7 of households are connected to the sewer network 325 according to the environment agency total water abstraction for public water supply in the uk was 16,406 megalitres per day in 2007 326 in england and wales the economic regulator of water companies is the water services regulation authority ofwat the environment agency is

for scotland and the environmental regulator is the scottish environment protection agency drinking water standards and wastewater discharge standards in the uk as in other countries of the european union are determined by the eu see water supply and sanitation in the european union in england and wales water and sewerage services are provided by 10 private regional water and sewerage companies and 13 mostly smaller private water only companies in scotland water and sewerage services are provided by a single public company scottish water in northern ireland water and sewerage services are also provided by a single public entity northern ireland water demographics a census is taken simultaneously in all parts of the uk every ten years 327 the office for national statistics is responsible for collecting data for england and wales the general register office for scotland and the northern ireland statistics and research agency each being responsible for censuses in their respective countries 328 in the 2011 census the total population of the united kingdom was 63,181,775 329 it is the third-largest in the european union the fifth-largest in the commonwealth and the 22nd-largest in the world in mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term international migration contributed more to population growth in mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural change contributed the most to population growth 330 between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7 329 this compares to 0.3 per year in the period 1991 to 2001 and 0.2 in the decade 1981 to 1991 331 the 2011 census also confirmed that the proportion of the population aged 0–14 has nearly halved  31 in 1911 compared to 18 in 2011 and the proportion of older people aged 65 and over has more than tripled from 5 to 16 329 it has been estimated that the number of people aged 100 or over will rise steeply to reach over 626,000 by 2080 332 englands population in 2011 was found to be 53 million 333 it is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with 420people resident per square kilometre in mid-2015 334 with a particular concentration in london and the south-east 335 the 2011 census put scotlands population at 5.3 million 336 wales at 3.06 million and northern ireland at 1.81 million 333 in percentage terms england has had the fastest growing population of any country of the uk in the period from 2001 to 2011 with an increase of 7.9 in 2012 the average total fertility rate tfr across the uk was 1.92 children per woman 337 while a rising birth rate is contributing to current population growth it remains considerably below the baby boom peak of 2.95 children per woman in 1964 338 below the replacement rate of 2.1 but higher than the 2001 record low of 1.63 337 in 2012 scotland had the lowest tfr at only 1.67 followed by wales at 1.88 england at 1.94 and northern ireland at 2.03 337 in 2011 47.3 of births in the uk were to unmarried women 339 a

historically indigenous british people were thought to be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 11th century the celts romans anglo-saxons norse and the normans welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the uk 344 a 2006 genetic study shows that more than 50 of englands gene pool contains germanic y chromosomes 345 another 2005 genetic analysis indicates that about 75 of the traceable ancestors of the modern british population had arrived in the british isles by about 6,200 years ago at the start of the british neolithic or stone age and that the british broadly share a common ancestry with the basque people 346 347 348 the uk has a history of small-scale non-white immigration with liverpool having the oldest black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the african slave trade 349 and the oldest chinese community in europe dating to the arrival of chinese seamen in the 19th century 350 in 1950 there were probably fewer than 20,000 non-white residents in britain almost all born overseas 351 since 1948 substantial immigration from africa the caribbean and south asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the british empire 352 migration from new eu member states in central and eastern europe since 2004 has resulted in growth in these population groups although some of this migration has been temporary 353 since the 1990s there has been substantial diversification of the immigrant population with migrants to the uk coming from a much wider range of countries than previous waves which tended to involve larger numbers of migrants coming from a relatively small number of countries 354 355 356 academics have argued that the ethnicity categories employed in british national statistics which were first introduced in the 1991 census involve confusion between the concepts of ethnicity and race 357 358 in 2011update 87.2 of the uk population identified themselves as white meaning 12.8 of the uk population identify themselves as of one of number of ethnic minority groups 359 in the 2001 census this figure was 7.9 of the uk population 360 because of differences in the wording of the census forms used in england and wales scotland and northern ireland data on the other white group is not available for the uk as a whole but in england and wales this was the fastest growing group between the 2001 and 2011 censuses increasing by 1.1 million  1.8 percentage points 361 amongst groups for which comparable data is available for all parts of the uk level there was considerable growth in the size of the other asian category which increased from 0.4 to 1.4 of the population between 2001 and 2011 359 360 there was also considerable growth in the mixed category in 2001 people in this category accounted for 1.2 of the uk population 360 by 2011 the proportion was 2 359 ethnic diversity varies significantly across the uk 30.4 of londons population and 37.4 of leicesters was estimated to be non-white in 2005update 362 363 whereas less than 5 of the populations of north east england wales and the south west were from ethnic minorities according to the 2001 census 364 in 2011update 26.5 of primary and 22.2 of secondary pupils at state schools in england were members of an ethnic minority 365 languages the uks de facto official language is english 371 372 it is

south asian languages including punjabi urdu hindi bengali tamil and gujarati are the largest grouping and are spoken by 2.7 of the uk population 373 according to the 2011 census polish has become the second-largest language spoken in england and has 546,000 speakers 374 four celtic languages are spoken in the uk welsh irish scottish gaelic and cornish all are recognised as regional or minority languages subject to specific measures of protection and promotion under the european charter for regional or minority languages 2 375 and the framework convention for the protection of national minorities 376 in the 2001 census over a fifth  21 of the population of wales said they could speak welsh 377 an increase from the 1991 census  18 378 in addition it is estimated that about 200,000 welsh speakers live in england 379 in the same census in northern ireland 167,487 people  10.4 stated that they had some knowledge of irish see irish language in northern ireland almost exclusively in the nationalist mainly catholic population over 92,000 people in scotland just under 2 of the population had some gaelic language ability including 72 of those living in the outer hebrides 380 the number of schoolchildren being taught through welsh scottish gaelic and irish is increasing 381 among emigrant-descended populations some scottish gaelic is still spoken in canada principally nova scotia and cape breton island 382 and welsh in patagonia argentina 383 scots a language descended from early northern middle english has limited recognition alongside its regional variant ulster scots in northern ireland without specific commitments to protection and promotion 2 384 it is compulsory for pupils to study a second language up to the age of 14 in england 385 and up to age 16 in scotland french and german are the two most commonly taught second languages in england and scotland all pupils in wales are taught welsh as a second language up to age 16 or are taught in welsh 386 religion forms of christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the united kingdom for over 1400 years 387 although a majority of citizens still identify with christianity in many surveys regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century 388 while immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of other faiths most notably islam 389 this has led some commentators to variously describe the uk as a multi-faith 390 secularised 391 or post-christian society 392 in the 2001 census 71.6 of all respondents indicated that they were christians with the next largest faiths being islam  2.8 hinduism  1.0 sikhism  0.6 judaism  0.5 buddhism  0.3 and all other religions  0.3 393 15 of respondents stated that they had no religion with a further 7 not stating a religious preference 394 a tearfund survey in 2007 showed only one in ten britons actually attend church weekly 395 between the 2001 and 2011 census there was a decrease in the amount of people who identified as christian by 12 whilst the percentage of those reporting no religious affiliation doubled this contrasted with growth in the other main religious group categories with the number of muslims increasing by the most substantial margin to a total of about 5 396 the muslim population has increased from 1.6 million in 2001 to 2.7 million in 2011 397 making it the second-largest religious group in the united kingdom 398 in a 2015 survey conducted by bsa british social attitudes on religious affiliation 49 of respondents indicated no religion while 42 indicated they were christians followed by 8 who affiliated with other religions eg islam hinduism judaism etc 399 among christians adherents to the church of england constituted 17 roman catholic church - 8 other christians including presbyterians methodists other protestants as well as eastern orthodox - 17 amid other religions islam accounted for 5 400 401 the church of england is the established church in england 402 it retains a representation in the uk parliament and the british monarch is its supreme governor 403 in scotland the church of scotland is recognised as the national church it is not subject to state control and the british monarch is an ordinary member required to swear an oath to maintain and preserve the protestant religion and presbyterian church government upon his or her accession 404 405 the church in wales was disestablished in 1920 and as the church of ireland was disestablished in 1870 before the partition of ireland there is no established church in northern ireland 406 although there are no uk-wide data in the 2001 census on adherence to individual christian denominations it has been estimated that 62 of christians are anglican 13.5 catholic 6 presbyterian 3.4 methodist with small numbers of other protestant denominations such as open brethren and orthodox churches 407 migration the united kingdom has experienced successive waves of migration the great famine in ireland then part of the united kingdom resulted in perhaps a million people migrating to great britain 408 unable to return to poland at the end of world war ii over 120,000 polish veterans remained in the uk permanently 409 after world war ii there was significant immigration from the colonies and newly independent former colonies partly as a legacy of empire and partly driven by labour shortages many of these migrants came from the caribbean and the indian subcontinent 410 in 1841 0.25 of the population of england and wales was born in a foreign country by 1931 this figure had risen to 2.6 and by 1951 it was 4.4 411 in 2014 the net increase was 318,000 immigration was 641,000 up from 526,000 in 2013 while the number of people emigrating for more than 12 months was 323,000 412 one of the more recent trends in migration has been the arrival of workers from the new eu member states in eastern europe known as the a8 countries 353 in 2010 there were 7.0 million foreign-born residents in the uk corresponding to 11.3 of the total population of these 4.76 million  7.7 were born outside the eu and 2.24 million  3.6 were born in another eu member state 413 the proportion of foreign-born people in the uk remains slightly below that of many other european countries 414 however immigration is now contributing to a rising population 415 with arrivals and uk-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 analysis of office for national statistics ons data shows that a net total of 2.3million migrants moved to the uk in the 15 years from 1991 to 2006 416 417 in 2008 it was predicted that migration would add 7million to the uk population by 2031 418 though these figures are disputed 419 the ons reported that net migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 to 239,000 420 in 2013 approximately 208,000 foreign citizens were naturalised as british citizens the highest number since records began in 1962 this figure fell to around 125,800 in 2014 between 2009 and 2013 the average number of people granted british citizenship per year was 195,800 the main countries of previous nationality of those naturalised in 2014 were india pakistan the philippines nigeria bangladesh nepal china south africa poland and somalia 421 the total number of grants of settlement which confers permanent residence in the uk without granting british citizenship 422 was approximately 154,700 in 2013 compared to 241,200 in 2010 and 129,800 in 2012 421 over a quarter  27.0 of live births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the uk according to official statistics released in 2015 423 citizens of the european union including those of the uk have the right to live and work in any eu member state 424 the uk applied temporary restrictions to citizens of romania and bulgaria which joined the eu in january 2007 425 research conducted by the migration policy institute for the equality and human rights commission suggests that between may 2004 and september 2009 1.5million workers migrated from the new eu member states to the uk two-thirds of them polish but that many subsequently returned home resulting in a net increase in the number of nationals of the new member states in the uk of some 700,000 over that period 426 427 the late-2000s recession in the uk reduced the economic incentive for poles to migrate to the uk 428 the migration becoming temporary and circular 429 in 2009 for the first time since enlargement more nationals of the eight central and eastern european states that had joined the eu in 2004 left the uk than arrived 430 in 2011 citizens of the new eu member states made up 13 of the immigrants entering the country 431 the british government has introduced a points-based immigration system for immigration from outside the european economic area to replace former schemes including the scottish governments fresh talent initiative 432 in june 2010 the government introduced a temporary limit of 24,000 on immigration from outside the eu aiming to discourage applications before a permanent cap was imposed in april 2011 433 emigration was an important feature of british society in the 19th century between 1815 and 1930 around 11.4million people emigrated from britain and 7.3million from ireland estimates show that by the end of the 20th century some 300million people of british and irish descent were permanently settled around the globe 434 today at least 5.5million uk-born people live abroad 435 436 437 mainly in australia spain the united
