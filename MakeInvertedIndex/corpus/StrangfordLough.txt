home to the worlds first commercial tidal stream power station seagen the 1.2 megawatt underwater tidal electricity generator part of northern irelands environment and renewable energy fund scheme takes advantage of the fast tidal flow in the lough which can be up to 4 ms although the generator is powerful enough to power up to a thousand homes the turbine has a minimal environmental impact as it is almost entirely submerged and the rotors turn slowly enough that they pose no danger to wildlife 15 16 17 since june 2008 a tidal energy device called evopod has been tested in strangford lough near the portaferry ferry landing 18 the device is a 1/10 scale prototype and is being monitored by queens university belfast the device is a semi submerged floating tidal turbine and is moored to the seabed via a buoy mounted swivel so that it always maintains optimum heading into the direction of the tidal flow the scale device is not grid connected and dissipates the small amount of power it generates as heat into the sea malik priestley executive creator of seagen said tidal power will provide sustainable amounts of green renewable energy and pose no threats to surrounding wild life
