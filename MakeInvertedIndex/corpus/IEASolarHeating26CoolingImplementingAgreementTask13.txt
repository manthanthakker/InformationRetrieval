iea solar heating  cooling implementing agreement task 13 iea solar heating  cooling implementing agreement - task 13 solar low energy buildings was an international effort organised by one of the international energy agencys implementing agreements to build several solar low-energy houses this took place between 1989 and 1993 the implementing agreement for a programme to develop and test solar heating and cooling systems is one of 40 research and development and deployment programmes which are at the core of the ieas international energy technology co-operation programme the idea behind task 13 was to push construction technology towards its limits to achieve the lowest possible total purchased energy consumption task 13 was part of the iea solar heating and cooling programme to test the designs and techniques and to monitor their performance  contents 1 design 2 the buildings 3 lessons learned 4 see also 5 external links  designedit on average the houses were designed to required 44 kwhm 75 lower than the average 172 kwhm that would have been required had the houses been built to normal standards analysis of 11 of the houses in use indicated that total savings made in practice was actually 60  1the 44 kwhm resulted from electricity  18 kwhm space heating  14 kwhm water heating  11 kwhm cooling  1 kwhm in addition there was an average solar contribution designed to average 37 kwhm from a combination of passive solar gains active solar and photovoltaics the buildings were constructed to be airtight be superinsulated to roughly double normal standards and to minimise thermal bridges masonry and several timber framed methods were represented along with a novel steel strengthened polystyrene block walls were used the berlin zero heating energy house included a 20m  700 cubic feet seasonal thermal store 2 the buildingsedit the homes in the programme were pleiade row house louvain-la-neuve belgium brampton advanced house canada waterloo region green home canada  3 kolding row house denmark iea 5 house pietarsaari finland ultrahouse rottweil germany  4 zero heating energy house berlin germany  5 wish house 3 iwaki japan  6 urban villa amstelveen netherlands  7 iea task 13 house hamar norway  8 roskar low energy house sweden duplex in gelterkinden switzerland exemplary house grand canyon united states exemplary house yosemite usa lessons learnededit among the lessons learned were that airtightness was difficult to achieve ventilation systems could suffer from noise and draft problems care was needed to design out summer overheating simple installations and systems were easier for the residents to understand for a report on the task 13 findings see energy design update december 2003 see alsoedit list of pioneering solar buildings passive house low-energy house zero energy building energy-plus-house sustainable development external linksedit iea shc implementing agreement task 13 advanced solar low energy buildings reaching extremely low levels of energy consumption strategies used the experiences of iea shc implementing agreement task 13 construction assemblies and details 1st wooden prefabricated zero energy house the german market
