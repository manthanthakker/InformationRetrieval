global warming global warming and climate change are terms for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the earths climate system and its related effects 2 multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming 3 4 5 although the increase of near-surface atmospheric temperature is the measure of global warming often reported in the popular press most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has gone into the oceans the rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and atmosphere 6a many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented over tens to thousands of years 7 scientific understanding of global warming is increasing the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reported in 2014 that scientists were more than 95 certain that global warming is mostly being caused by human anthropogenic activities mainly increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide co2 8 9 10 human-made carbon dioxide continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years methane and other often much more potent greenhouse gasses are also rising along with co2 11 currently about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels remains in the atmosphere the rest is absorbed by vegetation and the oceans 12 climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7c  0.5 to 3.1f for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to 4.8c  4.7 to 8.6f for the highest emissions scenario 13 these findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations 14b and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing 16 future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe 17 18 anticipated effects include warming global temperature rising sea levels changing precipitation and expansion of deserts in the subtropics 19 warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the arctic with the continuing retreat of glaciers permafrost and sea ice other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves droughts heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall 20 ocean acidification and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels 21 22 because the climate system has a large inertia and greenhouse gasses will stay in the atmosphere for a long time many of these effects will not only exist for decades or centuries but will persist for tens of thousands of years 23 possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction adaptation to its effects building systems resilient to its effects and possible future climate engineering most countries are parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc 24 whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change 25 parties to the unfccc have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required 26 and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0c  3.6f relative to pre-industrial levelsc with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5c  2.7f 28 public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing a global 2015 pew research center report showed a median of 54 consider it a very serious problem there are significant regional differences with americans and chinese whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual co2 emissions among the least concerned 29  contents 1 observed temperature changes 1.1 trends 1.2 warmest years 2 initial causes of temperature changes external forcings 2.1

8.3.1 surveys of public opinion 8.3.1 surveys of public opinion  observed temperature changes the global average land and ocean surface temperature shows a warming of 0.85  0.65 to 1.06 c in the period 1880 to 2012 based on multiple independently produced datasets 33 earths average surface temperature rose by 7002273890000000000♠0.74±0.18c over the period 1906–2005 the rate of warming almost doubled for the last half of that period  7002273279999999999♠0.13±0.03cper decade versus 7002273219999999999♠0.07±0.02cper decade 34 the average temperature of the lower troposphere has increased between 0.13 and 0.22c  0.23 and 0.40fperdecade since 1979 according to satellite temperature measurements climate proxies show the temperature to have been relatively stable over the one or two thousand years before 1850 with regionally varying fluctuations such as the medieval warm period and the little ice age 35 the warming that is evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations as documented by many independent scientific groups 36 examples include sea level rise 37 widespread melting of snow and land ice 38 increased heat content of the oceans 36 increased humidity 36 and the earlier timing of spring events 39 eg the flowering of plants 40 the probability that these changes could have occurred by chance is virtually zero 36 trends temperature changes vary over the globe since 1979 land temperatures have increased about twice as fast as ocean temperatures  7002273399999999999♠0.25cper decade against 7002273279999999999♠0.13cper decade 41 ocean temperatures increase more slowly than land temperatures because of the larger effective heat capacity of the oceans and because the ocean loses more heat by evaporation 42 since the beginning of industrialisation the temperature difference between the hemispheres has increased due to melting of sea ice and snow in the north 43 average arctic temperatures have been increasing at almost twice the rate of the rest of the world in the past 100 years however arctic temperatures are also highly variable 44 although more greenhouse gases are emitted in the northern than southern hemisphere this does not contribute to the difference in warming because the major greenhouse gases persist long enough to mix between hemispheres 45 the thermal inertia of the oceans and slow responses of other indirect effects mean that climate can take centuries or longer to adjust to changes in forcing one climate commitment study concluded that if greenhouse gases were stabilized at year 2000 levels surface temperatures would still increase by about one-half degree celsius 46 and another found that if they were stabilized at 2005 levels surface warming could exceed a whole degree celsius some of this surface warming will be driven by past natural forcings which are still seeking equilibrium in the climate system one study using a highly simplified climate model indicates these past natural forcings may account for as much as 64 of the committed 2050 surface warming and their influence will fade with time compared to the human contribution 47 global temperature is subject to short-term fluctuations that overlay long-term trends and can temporarily mask them the relative stability in surface temperature from 2002 to 2009 which has been dubbed the global warming hiatus by the media and some scientists 48 is consistent with such an episode 49 50 2015 updates to account for differing methods of measuring ocean surface temperature measurements show a positive trend over the recent decade 51 52 warmest years fifteen of the top 16 warmest years have occurred since 2000 53 while record-breaking years can attract considerable public interest individual years are less significant than the overall trend some climatologists have criticized the attention that the popular press gives to warmest year statistics for example gavin schmidt stated the long-term trends or the expected sequence of records are far more important than whether any single year is a record or not 54 ocean oscillations such as the el niño southern oscillation enso can affect global average temperatures causing temperatures of a given year to be abnormally warm or cold for reasons not directly related to the overall trend of climate change for example 1998 and 2015 temperatures were significantly enhanced by strong el niño conditions initial causes of temperature changes external forcings the climate system can warm or cool in response to changes in external forcings 55 56 these are external to the climate system but not necessarily external to earth 57 examples of external forcings include changes in atmospheric composition eg increased concentrations of greenhouse gases solar luminosity volcanic eruptions and variations in earths orbit around the sun 58 greenhouse gases the greenhouse effect is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by gases in a planets atmosphere warm its lower atmosphere and surface it was proposed by joseph fourier in 1824 discovered in 1860 by john tyndall 59 was first investigated quantitatively by svante arrhenius in 1896 60 and was developed in the 1930s through 1960s by guy stewart callendar 61 on earth naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases cause air temperature near the surface to be about 33c  59f warmer than it would be in their absence 62d without the earths atmosphere the earths average temperature would be well below the freezing temperature of water 63 the major greenhouse gases are water vapour which causes about 36–70 of the greenhouse effect carbon dioxide co2 which causes 9–26 methane ch4 which causes 4–9 and ozone o3 which causes 3–7 64 65 66 clouds also affect the radiation balance through cloud forcings similar to greenhouse gases human activity since the industrial revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to increased radiative forcing from co2 methane tropospheric ozone cfcs and nitrous oxide according to work published in 2007 the concentrations of co2 and methane have increased by 36 and 148 respectively since 1750 67 these levels are much higher than at any time during the last 800,000 years the period for which reliable data has been extracted from ice cores 68 69 70 71 less direct geological evidence indicates that co2 values higher than this were last seen about 20 million years ago 72 fossil fuel burning has produced about three-quarters of the increase in co2 from human activity over the past 20 years the rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land-use particularly deforestation 73 another significant non-fuel source of anthropogenic co2 emissions is the calcination of limestone for clinker production a chemical process which releases co2 74 estimates of global co2 emissions in 2011 from fossil fuel combustion including cement production and gas flaring was 34.8 billion tonnes  9.5  0.5 pgc an increase of 54 above emissions in 1990 coal burning was responsible for 43 of the total emissions oil 34 gas 18 cement 4.9 and gas flaring 0.7 75 in may 2013 it was reported that readings for co2 taken at the worlds primary benchmark site in mauna loa surpassed 400 ppm according to professor brian hoskins this is likely the first time co2 levels have been this high for about 4.5 million years 76 77 monthly global co2 concentrations exceeded 400 ppm in march 2015 probably for the first time in several million years 78 on 12 november 2015 nasa scientists reported that human-made carbon dioxide continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years currently about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans and remains in the atmosphere 12 over the last three decades of the twentieth century gross domestic product per capita and population growth were the main drivers of increases in greenhouse gas emissions 79 co2 emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change 80 81:71 emissions can be attributed to different regions attributions of emissions due to land-use change are subject to considerable uncertainty 82 83:289 emissions scenarios estimates of changes in future emission levels of greenhouse gases have been projected that depend upon uncertain economic sociological technological and natural developments 84 in most scenarios emissions continue to rise over the century while in a few emissions are reduced 85 86 fossil fuel reserves are abundant and will not limit carbon emissions in the 21st century 87 emission scenarios combined with modelling of the carbon cycle have been used to produce estimates of how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future using the six ipcc sres marker scenarios models suggest that by the year 2100 the atmospheric concentration of co2 could range between 541 and 970 ppm 88 this is 90–250 above the concentration in the year 1750 the popular media and the public often confuse global warming with ozone depletion ie the destruction of stratospheric ozone eg the ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons 89 90 although there are a few areas of linkage the relationship between the two is not strong reduced stratospheric ozone has had a slight cooling influence on surface temperatures while increased tropospheric ozone has had a somewhat larger warming effect 91 aerosols and soot global dimming a gradual reduction in the amount of global direct irradiance at the earths surface was observed from 1961 until at least 1990 92 solid and liquid particles known as aerosols produced by volcanoes and human-made pollutants are thought to be the main cause of this dimming they exert a cooling effect by increasing the reflection of incoming sunlight the effects of the products of fossil fuel combustion co2 and aerosols have partially offset one another in recent decades so that net warming has been due to the increase in non-co2 greenhouse gases such as methane 93 radiative forcing due to aerosols is temporally limited due to the processes that remove aerosols from the atmosphere removal by clouds and precipitation gives tropospheric aerosols an atmospheric lifetime of only about a week while stratospheric aerosols can remain for a few years carbon dioxide has a lifetime of a century or more and as such changes in aerosols will only delay climate changes due to carbon dioxide 94 black carbon is second only to carbon dioxide for its contribution to global warming 95 in addition to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing solar radiation aerosols have indirect effects on the earths radiation budget sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets a phenomenon known as the twomey effect 96 this effect also causes droplets to be of more uniform size which reduces growth of raindrops and makes the cloud more reflective to incoming sunlight known as the albrecht effect 97 indirect effects are most noticeable in marine stratiform clouds and have very little radiative effect on convective clouds indirect effects of aerosols represent the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing 98 soot may either cool or warm earths climate system depending on whether it is airborne or deposited atmospheric soot directly absorbs solar radiation which heats the atmosphere and cools the surface in isolated areas with high soot production such as rural india as much as 50 of surface warming due to greenhouse gases may be masked by atmospheric brown clouds 99 when deposited especially on glaciers or on ice in arctic regions the lower surface albedo can also directly heat the surface 100 the influences of atmospheric particles including black carbon are most pronounced in the tropics and sub-tropics particularly in asia while the effects of greenhouse gases are dominant in the extratropics and southern hemisphere 101 solar activity since 1978 solar irradiance has been measured by satellites 104 these measurements indicate that the suns radiative output has not increased since 1978 so the warming during the past 30 years cannot be attributed to an increase in solar energy reaching the earth climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change 105 models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when they only take into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity models are however able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings including human influences and natural forcings another line of evidence against solar variations having caused recent climate change comes from looking at how temperatures at different levels in the earths atmosphere have changed 106 models and observations show that greenhouse warming results in warming of the lower atmosphere the troposphere but cooling of the upper atmosphere the stratosphere 107 108 depletion of the ozone layer by chemical refrigerants has also resulted in a strong cooling effect in the stratosphere if solar variations were responsible for observed warming warming of both the troposphere and stratosphere would be expected 109 variations in earths orbit the tilt of the earths axis and the shape of its orbit around the sun vary slowly over tens of thousands of years and are a natural source of climate change by changing the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar insolation 110 during the last few thousand years this phenomenon contributed to a slow cooling trend at high latitudes of the northern hemisphere during summer a trend that was reversed by greenhouse-gas-induced warming during the 20th century 111 112 113 114 variations in orbital cycles may initiate a new glacial period in the future though the timing of this depends on greenhouse gas concentrations as well as the orbital forcing a new glacial period is not expected within the next 50,000 years if atmospheric co2 concentration remains above 300 ppm 115 116 feedback the climate system includes a range of feedbacks which alter the response of the system to changes in external forcings positive feedbacks increase the response of the climate system to an initial forcing while negative feedbacks reduce it 117 there are a range of feedbacks in the climate system including water vapour changes in ice-albedo snow and ice cover affect how much the earths surface absorbs or reflects incoming sunlight clouds and changes in the earths carbon cycle eg the release of carbon from soil 118 the main negative feedback is the energy the earths surface radiates into space as infrared radiation 119 according to the stefan-boltzmann law if the absolute temperature as measured in kelvin doublese radiated energy increases by a factor of 16  2 to the 4th power 120 feedbacks are an important factor in determining the sensitivity of the climate system to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations other factors being equal a higher climate sensitivity means that more warming will occur for a given increase in greenhouse gas forcing 121 uncertainty over the effect of feedbacks is a major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given forcing scenario more research is needed to understand the role of clouds 117 and carbon cycle feedbacks in climate projections 122 the ipcc projections previously mentioned span the likely range greater than 66 probability based on expert judgement 8 for the selected emissions scenarios however the ipccs projections do not reflect the full range of uncertainty 123 the lower end of the likely range appears to be better constrained than the upper end 123 climate models a climate model is a representation of the physical chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system 126 such models are based on scientific disciplines such as fluid dynamics and thermodynamics as well as physical processes such as radiative transfer the models may be used to predict a range of variables such as local air movement temperature clouds and other atmospheric properties ocean temperature salt content and circulation ice cover on land and sea the transfer of heat and moisture from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere and chemical and biological processes among others although researchers attempt to include as many processes as possible simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system results from models can also vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and the models climate sensitivity for example the uncertainty in ipccs 2007 projections is caused by  1 the use of multiple models 123 with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations 127  2 the use of differing estimates of humanitys future greenhouse gas emissions 123  3 any additional emissions from climate feedbacks that were not included in the models ipcc used to prepare its report ie greenhouse gas releases from permafrost 128 the models do not assume the climate will warm due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases instead the models predict how greenhouse gases will interact with radiative transfer and other physical processes warming or cooling is thus a result not an assumption of the models 129 clouds and their effects are especially difficult to predict improving the models representation of clouds is therefore an important topic in current research 130 another prominent research topic is expanding and improving representations of the carbon cycle 131 132 133 models are also used to help investigate the causes of recent climate change by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human causes although these models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects they do indicate that the warming since 1970 is dominated by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 58 the physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates 134 climate models produce a good match to observations of global temperature changes over the last century but do not simulate all aspects of climate 135 not all effects of global warming are accurately predicted by the climate models used by the ipcc observed arctic shrinkage has been faster than that predicted 136 precipitation increased proportionally to atmospheric humidity and hence significantly faster than global climate models predict 137 138 since 1990 sea level has also risen considerably faster than models predicted it would 139 observed and expected environmental effects anthropogenic forcing has likely contributed to some of the observed changes including sea level rise changes in climate extremes such as the number of warm and cold days declines in arctic sea ice extent glacier retreat and greening of the sahara 142 143 during the 21st century glaciers 144 and snow cover 145 are projected to continue their widespread retreat projections of declines in arctic sea ice vary 146 147 recent projections suggest that arctic summers could be ice-free defined as ice extent less than 1 million square km as early as 2025-2030 148 detection is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed in some defined statistical sense without providing a reason for that change detection does not imply attribution of the detected change to a particular cause attribution of causes of climate change is the process of establishing the most likely causes for the detected change with some defined level of confidence 149 detection and attribution may also be applied to observed changes in physical ecological and social systems 150 extreme weather changes in regional climate are expected to include greater warming over land with most warming at high northern latitudes and least warming over the southern ocean and parts of the north atlantic ocean 151 future changes in precipitation are expected to follow existing trends with reduced precipitation over subtropical land areas and increased precipitation at subpolar latitudes and some equatorial regions 152 projections suggest a probable increase in the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events such as heat waves 153 a 2015 study published in nature climate change states data analysis of extreme events from 1960 till 2010 suggests that droughts and heat waves appear simultaneously with increased frequency 156 extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased since 1980 157 sea level rise the sea level rise since 1993 has been estimated to have been on average 2.6mm and 2.9mm per year  0.4mm additionally sea level rise has accelerated from 1995 to 2015 158 over the 21st century the ipcc projects for a high emissions scenario that global mean sea level could rise by 52–98cm 159 the ipccs projections are conservative and may underestimate future sea level rise 160 other estimates suggest that for the same period global mean sea level could rise by 0.2 to 2.0 m  0.7–6.6ft relative to mean sea level in 1992 140 widespread coastal flooding would be expected if several degrees of warming is sustained for millennia 161 for example sustained global warming of more than 2c relative to pre-industrial levels could lead to eventual sea level rise of around 1 to 4 m due to thermal expansion of sea water and the melting of glaciers and small ice caps 161 melting of the greenland ice sheet could contribute an additional 4 to 7.5m over many thousands of years 161 it has been estimated that we are already committed to a sea-level rise of approximately 2.3 metres for each degree of temperature rise within the next 2,000 years 162 warming beyond the 2c target would potentially lead to rates of sea-level rise dominated by ice loss from antarctica continued co2 emissions from fossil sources could cause additional tens of metres of sea level rise over the next millennia and eventually ultimately eliminate the entire antarctic ice sheet causing about 58 metres of sea level rise 163 ecological systems in terrestrial ecosystems the earlier timing of spring events as well as poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges have been linked with high confidence to recent warming 164 future climate change is expected to affect particular ecosystems including tundra mangroves and coral reefs 151 it is expected that most ecosystems will be affected by higher atmospheric co2 levels combined with higher global temperatures 165 overall it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems 166 increases in atmospheric co2 concentrations have led to an increase in ocean acidity 167 dissolved co2 increases ocean acidity measured by lower ph values 167 between 1750 and 2000 surface-ocean ph has decreased by ≈0.1 from ≈8.2 to ≈8.1 168 surface-ocean ph has probably not been below ≈8.1 during the past 2 million years 168 projections suggest that surface-ocean ph could decrease by an additional 0.3–0.4 units by 2100 169 future ocean acidification could threaten coral reefs fisheries protected species and other natural resources of value to society 167 170 ocean deoxygenation is projected to increase hypoxia by 10 and triple suboxic waters oxygen concentrations 98 less than the mean surface concentrations for each 1c of upper ocean warming 171 long-term effects on the timescale of centuries to millennia the magnitude of global warming will be determined primarily by anthropogenic co2 emissions 172 this is due to carbon dioxides very long lifetime in the atmosphere 172 stabilizing the global average temperature would require large reductions in co2 emissions 172 as well as reductions in emissions of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide 172 173 emissions of co2 would need to be reduced by more than 80 relative to their peak level 172 even if this were achieved global average temperatures would remain close to their highest level for many centuries 172 long-term effects also include a response from the earths crust due to ice melting and deglaciation in a process called post-glacial rebound when land masses are no longer depressed by the weight of ice this could lead to landslides and increased seismic and volcanic activities tsunamis could be generated by submarine landslides caused by warmer ocean water thawing ocean-floor permafrost or releasing gas hydrates 174 some world regions such as the french alps already show signs of an increase in landslide frequency 175 large-scale and abrupt impacts climate change could result in global large-scale changes in natural and social systems 176 examples include the possibility for the atlantic meridional overturning circulation to slow- or shutdown which in the instance of a shutdown would change weather in europe and north america considerably ocean acidification caused by increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and the long-term melting of ice sheets which contributes to sea level rise 177 some large-scale changes could occur abruptly ie over a short time period and might also be irreversible examples of abrupt climate change are the rapid release of methane and carbon dioxide from permafrost which would lead to amplified global warming or the shutdown of thermohaline circulation 178 179 scientific understanding of abrupt climate change is generally poor 180 the probability of abrupt change for some climate related feedbacks may be low 178 181 factors that may increase the probability of abrupt climate change include higher magnitudes of global warming warming that occurs more rapidly and warming that is sustained over longer time periods 181 observed and expected effects on social systems the effects of climate change on human systems mostly due to warming or shifts in precipitation patterns or both have been detected worldwide production of wheat and maize globally has been impacted by climate change while crop production has increased in some mid-latitude regions such as the uk and northeast china economic losses due to extreme weather events have increased globally there has been a shift from cold- to heat-related mortality in some regions as a result of warming livelihoods of indigenous peoples of the arctic have been altered by climate change and there is emerging evidence of climate change impacts on livelihoods of indigenous peoples in other regions regional impacts of climate change are now observable at more locations than before on all continents and across ocean regions 182 the future social impacts of climate change will be uneven 183 many risks are expected to increase with higher magnitudes of global warming 184 all regions are at risk of experiencing negative impacts 185 low-latitude less developed areas face the greatest risk 186 a study from 2015 concluded that economic growth gross domestic product of poorer countries is much more impaired with projected future climate warming than previously thought 187 a meta-analysis of 56 studies concluded in 2014 that each degree of temperature rise will increase violence by up to 20 which includes fist fights violent crimes civil unrest or wars 188 examples of impacts include food crop production will probably be negatively affected in low latitude countries while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative 189 global warming of around 4.6c relative to pre-industrial levels could pose a large risk to global and regional food security 190 health generally impacts will be more negative than positive 191 192 193 impacts include the effects of extreme weather leading to injury and loss of life 194 and indirect effects such as undernutrition brought on by crop failures 192 193 195 habitat inundation in small islands and mega deltas inundation as a result of sea level rise is expected to threaten vital infrastructure and human settlements 196 197 this could lead to issues of homelessness in countries with low-lying areas such as bangladesh as well as statelessness for populations in countries such as the maldives and tuvalu 198 economy estimates based on the ipcc a1b emission scenario from additional co2 and ch4 greenhouse gases released from permafrost estimate associated impact damages by us$43 trillion 199 infrastructure continued permafrost degradation will likely result in unstable infrastructure in arctic regions or alaska before 2100 thus impacting roads pipelines and buildings as well as water distribution and cause slope failures 200 possible responses to global warming mitigation mitigation of climate change are actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or enhance the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb ghgs from the atmosphere 202 there is a large potential for future reductions in emissions by a combination of activities including energy conservation and increased energy efficiency the use of low-carbon energy technologies such as renewable energy nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage 203 204 and enhancing carbon sinks through for example reforestation and preventing deforestation 203 204 a 2015 report by citibank concluded that transitioning to a low carbon economy would yield positive return on investments 205 near- and long-term trends in the global energy system are inconsistent with limiting global warming at below 1.5 or 2c relative to pre-industrial levels 206 207 pledges made as part of the cancún agreements are broadly consistent with having a likely chance  66 to 100 probability of limiting global warming in the 21st century at below 3c relative to pre-industrial levels 207 in limiting warming at below 2c more stringent emission reductions in the near-term would allow for less rapid reductions after 2030 208 many integrated models are unable to meet the 2c target if pessimistic assumptions are made about the availability of mitigation technologies 209 adaptation other policy responses include adaptation to climate change adaptation to climate change may be planned either in reaction to or anticipation of climate change or spontaneous ie without government intervention 210 planned adaptation is already occurring on a limited basis 203 the barriers limits and costs of future adaptation are not fully understood 203 a concept related to adaptation is adaptive capacity which is the ability of a system human natural or managed to adjust to climate change including climate variability and extremes to moderate potential damages to take advantage of opportunities or to cope with consequences 211 unmitigated climate change ie future climate change without efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions would in the long term be likely to exceed the capacity of natural managed and human systems to adapt 212 environmental organizations and public figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions 213 climate engineering climate engineering sometimes called geoengineering or climate intervention is the deliberate modification of the climate it has been investigated as a possible response to global warming eg by nasa 214 and the royal society 215 techniques under research fall generally into the categories solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal although various other schemes have been suggested a study from 2014 investigated the most common climate engineering methods and concluded they are either ineffective or have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change 216 discourse about global warming political discussion most countries in the world are parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc 219 the ultimate objective of the convention is to prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system 220 as stated in the convention this requires that ghg concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change food production is not threatened and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion 221 the framework convention was agreed in 1992 but since then global emissions have risen 222 during negotiations the g77 a lobbying group in the united nations representing 133 developing nations 223:4 pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to take the lead in reducing their emissions 224 this was justified on the basis that the developed worlds emissions had contributed most to the cumulation of ghgs in the atmosphere per-capita emissions ie emissions per head of population were still relatively low in developing countries and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs 83:290 this mandate was sustained in the kyoto protocol to the framework convention 83:290 which entered into legal effect in 2005 225 in ratifying the kyoto protocol most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions these first-round commitments expired in 2012 225 united states president george w bush rejected the treaty on the basis that it exempts 80 of the world including major population centres such as china and india from compliance and would cause serious harm to the us economy 223:5 at the 15th unfccc conference of the parties held in 2009 at copenhagen several unfccc parties produced the copenhagen accord 226 227 parties associated with the accord  140 countries as of november 2010 228:9 aim to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below 7002275149999999999♠2c 229 the 16th conference of the parties cop16 was held at cancún in 2010 it produced an agreement not a binding treaty that the parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to 7002275149999999999♠2c above pre-industrial temperatures it also recognized the need to consider strengthening the goal to a global average rise of 7002274649999999999♠1.5c 230 scientific discussion there is continuing discussion through published peer-reviewed scientific papers which are assessed by scientists working in the relevant fields taking part in the intergovernmental panel on climate change the scientific consensus as of 2013 stated in the ipcc fifth assessment report is that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century 231 a 2008 report by the us national academy of sciences stated that most scientists by then agreed that observed warming in recent decades was primarily caused by human activities increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere 80 in 2005 the royal society stated that while the overwhelming majority of scientists were in agreement on the main points some individuals and organizations opposed to the consensus on urgent action needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have tried to undermine the science and work of the ipcc 232 national science academies have called on world leaders for policies to cut global emissions 233 in the scientific literature there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases 234 no scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view 16 235 discussion by the public and in popular media the global warming controversy refers to a variety of disputes substantially more pronounced in the popular media than in the scientific literature 236 237 regarding the nature causes and consequences of global warming the disputed issues include the causes of increased global average air temperature especially since the mid-20th century whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations whether humankind has contributed significantly to it and whether the increase is completely or partially an artefact of poor measurements additional disputes concern estimates of climate sensitivity predictions of additional warming and what the consequences of global warming will be from 1990 to 1997 right-wing conservative think tanks in the united states mobilized to challenge the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem they challenged the scientific evidence argued that global warming will have benefits and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good 238 some people dispute aspects of climate change science 232 239 organizations such as the libertarian competitive enterprise institute conservative commentators and some companies such as exxonmobil have challenged ipcc climate change scenarios funded scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus and provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter controls 240 241 242 243 on the other hand some fossil fuel companies have scaled back their efforts in recent years 244 or even called for policies to reduce global warming 245 global oil companies have begun to acknowledge climate change exists and is caused by human activities and the burning of fossil fuels 246 surveys of public opinion the world public or at least people in economically advanced regions became broadly aware of the global warming problem in the late 1980s polling groups began to track opinions on the subject at first mainly in the united states 247 the longest consistent polling by gallup in the us found relatively small deviations of 10 or so from 1998 to 2015 in opinion on the seriousness of global warming but with increasing polarization between those concerned and those unconcerned 248 the first major worldwide poll conducted by gallup in 2008-2009 in 127 countries found that some 62 of people worldwide said they knew about global warming in the advanced countries of north america europe and japan 90 or more knew about it  97 in the us 99 in japan in less developed countries especially in africa fewer than a quarter knew about it although many had noticed local weather changes among those who knew about global warming there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities 249 by 2010 with 111 countries surveyed gallup determined that there was a substantial decrease since 2007–08 in the number of americans and europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat in the us just a little over half the population  53 now viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families this was 10 points below the 2008 poll  63 latin america had the biggest rise in concern 73 said global warming is a serious threat to their families 250 this global poll also found that people are more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes except in the us where nearly half  47 of the population attributed global warming to natural causes 251 a marchmay 2013 survey by pew research center for the people  the press polled 39 countries about global threats according to 54 of those questioned global warming featured top of the perceived global threats 252 in a january 2013 survey pew found that 69 of americans say there is solid evidence that the earths average temperature has got warmer over the past few decades up six points since november 2011 and 12 points since 2009 253 a 2010 survey of 14 industrialized countries found that skepticism about the danger of global warming was highest in australia norway new zealand and the united states in that order correlating positively with per capita emissions of carbon dioxide 254 etymology in the 1950s research suggested increasing temperatures and a 1952 newspaper reported climate change this phrase next appeared in a november 1957 report in the hammond times which described roger revelles research into the effects of increasing human-caused co2 emissions on the greenhouse effect a large scale global warming with radical climate changes may result both phrases were only used occasionally until 1975 when wallace smith broecker published a scientific paper on the topic climatic change are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming the phrase began to come into common use and in 1976 mikhail budykos statement that a global warming up has started was widely reported 255 other studies such as a 1971 mit report referred to the human impact as inadvertent climate modification but an influential 1979 national academy of sciences study headed by jule charney followed broecker in using global warming for rising surface temperatures while describing the wider effects of increased co2 as climate change 256 in 1986 and november 1987 nasa climate scientist james hansen gave testimony to congress on global warming there were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988 and when hansen testified in the senate on 23 june he sparked worldwide interest 257 he said global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming 258 public attention increased over the summer and global warming became the dominant popular term commonly used both by the press and in public discourse 256 in a 2008 nasa article on usage erik m conway defined global warming as the increase in earths average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases while climate change was a long-term change in the earths climate or of a region on earth as effects such as changing patterns of rainfall and rising sea levels would probably have more impact than temperatures alone he considered global climate change a more scientifically accurate term and like the intergovernmental panel on climate change the nasa website would emphasize this wider context 256 see also global warming portal science portal book global warming climate change and agriculture effects of global warming on oceans
