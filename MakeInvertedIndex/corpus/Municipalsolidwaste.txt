are discarded by the public garbage can also refer specifically to food waste as in a garbage disposal the two are sometimes collected separately  contents 1 composition 2 components of solid waste

municipal solid waste varies greatly from municipality to municipality country to country and changes significantly with time in municipalities countries which have a well developed waste recycling system the waste stream consists mainly of intractable wastes such as plastic film and unrecyclable packaging materials at the start of the 20th century the majority of domestic waste  53 in the uk consisted of coal ash from open fires 1 in developed municipalities countries without significant recycling activity it predominantly includes food wastes market wastes yard wastes plastic containers and product packaging materials and other miscellaneous solid wastes from residential commercial institutional and industrial sources 2 most definitions of municipal solid waste do not include industrial wastes agricultural wastes medical waste radioactive waste or sewage sludge 3 waste collection is performed by the municipality within a given area the term residual waste relates to waste left from household sources containing materials that have not been separated out or sent for reprocessing 4 waste can be classified in several ways but the following list represents a typical classification biodegradable waste food and kitchen waste green waste paper most can be recycled although some difficult to compost plant material may be excluded  5 recyclable materials paper cardboard glass bottles jars tin cans aluminum cans aluminum foil metals certain plastics fabrics clothes tires batteries etc inert waste construction and demolition waste dirt rocks debris electrical and electronic waste weee - electrical appliances light bulbs washing machines tvs computers screens mobile phones alarm clocks watches etc composite wastes waste clothing tetra packs waste plastics such as toys hazardous waste including most paints chemicals tires batteries light bulbs electrical appliances fluorescent lamps aerosol spray cans and fertilizers toxic waste including pesticides herbicides and fungicides biomedical waste expired pharmaceutical drugs etc components of solid waste managementedit the municipal solid waste industry has four components recycling composting disposal and waste-to-energy via incineration 6 there is no single approach that can be applied to the management of all waste streams therefore the environmental protection agency federal agency of the united states of america developed a hierarchy ranking strategy for municipal solid waste 7 the waste management hierarchy is made up of four levels ordered from most preferred to least preferred methods based on their environmental soundness source reduction and reuse recycling or composting energy recovery treatment and disposal 8 collectionedit the functional element of collection includes not only the gathering of solid waste and recyclable materials but also the transport of these materials after collection to the location where the collection vehicle is emptied this location may be a materials processing facility a transfer station or a landfill disposal site waste handling and separation storage and processing at the sourceedit waste handling and separation involves activities associated with waste management until the waste is placed in storage containers for collection handling also encompasses the movement of loaded containers to the point of collection separating different types of waste components is an important step in the handling and storage of solid waste at the source segregation and processing and transformation of solid wastesedit the types of means and facilities that are now used for the recovery of waste materials that have been separated at the source include curbside kerbside in the uk collection drop-off and buy-back centers the separation and processing of wastes that have been separated at the source and the separation of commingled wastes usually occur at a materials recovery facility transfer stations combustion facilities and disposal sites transfer and transportedit this element involves two main steps first the waste is transferred from a smaller collection vehicle to larger transport equipment the waste is then transported usually over long distances to a processing or disposal site disposaledit today the disposal of wastes by land filling or land spreading is the ultimate fate of all solid wastes whether they are residential wastes collected and transported directly to a landfill site residual materials from materials recovery facilities mrfs residue from the combustion of solid waste compost or other substances from various solid waste processing facilities a modern sanitary landfill is not a dump it is an engineered facility used for disposing of solid wastes on land without creating nuisances or hazards to public health or safety such as the problems of insects and the contamination of ground water reusingedit in the recent years environmental organizations such as freegle or freecycle network have been gaining popularity for their online reuse networks these networks provide a worldwide online registry of unwanted items that would otherwise be thrown away for individuals and nonprofits to reuse or recycle therefore this free internet-based service reduces landfill pollution and promotes the gift economy landfillsedit landfills are created by land dumping land dumping methods vary most commonly it involves the mass dumping of waste into a designated area usually a hole or sidehill after the waste is dumped it is then compacted by large machines when the dumping cell is full it is then sealed with a plastic sheet and covered in several feet of dirt this is the primary method of dumping in the united states because of the low cost and abundance of unused land in north america landfills pose the threat of pollution and can intoxicate ground water the signs of pollution are effectively masked by disposal companies and it is often hard to see any evidence usually landfills are surrounded by large walls or fences hiding the mounds of debris large amounts of chemical odor eliminating agent are sprayed in the air surrounding landfills to hide the evidence of the rotting waste inside the plant 9 energy generationedit municipal solid waste can be used to generate energy several technologies have been developed that make the processing of msw for energy generation cleaner and more economical than ever before including landfill gas capture combustion pyrolysis gasification and plasma arc gasification 10 while older waste incineration plants emitted high levels of pollutants recent regulatory changes and new technologies have significantly reduced this concern united states environmental protection agency epa regulations in 1995 and 2000 under the clean air act have succeeded in reducing emissions of dioxins from waste-to-energy facilities by more than 99 percent below 1990 levels while mercury emissions have been reduced by over 90 percent 11 the epa noted these improvements in 2003 citing waste-to-energy as a power source with less environmental impact than almost any other source of electricity 12 see alsoedit garbology study of
