leadership in energy and environmental design leadership in energy and environmental design leed is one of the most popular green building certification programs used worldwide 7 developed by the non-profit us green building council usgbc it includes a set of rating systems for the design construction operation and maintenance of green buildings homes and neighborhoods 8 that aims to help

comprehensive system of interrelated standards covering aspects from the design and construction to the maintenance and operation of buildings leed also has grown from six volunteers on one committee to 119,924 staff volunteers and professionals 9 leed standards have been applied to approximately 83,452 registered and certified leed projects worldwide covering around 13.8 billion square feet  1.28 billion square meters 10 many us federal agencies and states and local governments require or reward leed certification however four states alabama georgia maine and mississippi have effectively banned the use of leed in new public buildings preferring other industry standards that the usgbc considers too lax 11 unlike model building codes such as the international building code only members of the usgbc and specific in-house committees may add to subtract from or edit the standard subject to an internal review process proposals to modify the leed standards are offered and publicly reviewed by usgbcs member organizations which number almost 12,216 9 usgbcs green business certification inc gbci offers various accreditation to people who demonstrate knowledge of the leed rating system including leed accredited professional leed ap leed green associate 12 and since 2011 leed fellows the highest designation for leed professionals gbci also certifies projects pursuing leed rating systemsedit leed has evolved since 1998 to more accurately represent and incorporate emerging green building technologies the pilot version leed new construction nc v1.0 led to leed ncv2.0 leed ncv2.2 in 2005 and leed 2009 previously named leed v3 in 2009 leed v4 was introduced in november 2013 until october 31 2016 new projects may choose between leed 2009 and leed v4 new projects registering after october 31 2016 must use leed v4 13 leed 2009 encompasses ten rating systems for the design construction and operation of buildings homes and neighborhoods 8 five overarching categories correspond to the specialties available under the leed professional program that suite currently consists of green building design  construction leed for new construction leed for core  shell leed for schools leed for retail new construction and major renovations leed for healthcare green interior design  construction leed for commercial interiors leed for retail commercial interiors green building operations  maintenance leed for existing buildings operations  maintenance green neighborhood development leed for neighborhood development 8 green home design and construction leed for homes the leed for homes rating system is different from leed v3 with different point categories and thresholds that reward efficient residential designcitation needed leed also forms the basis for other sustainability rating systems such as the environmental protection agencys labs21 to make it easier to follow leed requirements in 2009 usgbc helped buildinggreen develop leeduser a guide to the leed certification process and applying for leed credits written by professionals in the field 14 leed 2009edit after four years of development aligning credits across all leed rating systems and weighting credits based on environmental priority usgbc launched leed v3 15 which consists of a new continuous development process a new version of leed online a revised third-party certification program and a new suite of rating systems known as leed 2009 under leed 2009 there are 100 possible base points distributed across six credit categories sustainable sites water efficiency energy and atmosphere materials and resources indoor environmental quality innovation in design up to 10 additional points may be earned four additional points may be received for regional priority credits and six additional points for innovation in design which includes exemplary performance credits for existing credit categories certification leveledit buildings can qualify for four levels of certification certified 40–49 points silver 50–59 points gold 60–79 points platinum 80 points and above goal of the credit systemedit the leed 2009 performance credit system aims to allocate points based on the potential environmental impacts and human benefits of each credit these are weighed using the environmental impact categories of the united states environmental protection agencys tools for the reduction and assessment of chemical and other environmental impacts traci 16 and the environmental-impact weighting scheme developed by the national institute of standards and technology nist prerequisitesedit to participate in leed 2009 a building must comply with environmental laws and regulations occupancy scenarios building permanence and pre-rating completion site boundaries and area-to-site ratios its owner must share data on the buildings energy and water use for five years after occupancy for new construction or date of certification for existing buildings 17 each of the performance categories also have mandatory measures in each category which receive no points credit weighting processedit the weighting process has three steps 18 this system results in a weighted average for each rating scheme based upon actual impacts and the relative importance of those impacts to human health and environmental quality the leed council also appears to have assigned credit and measure weighting based upon the market implications of point allocation 18 from 2010 buildings can use carbon offsets to achieve green power credits for leed-nc new construction certification 19 leed for homesedit additional performance categories in the leed for homes rating system are locations and linkages recognizing the importance of transportation access open space and physical activity outdoors and awareness and education recognizing the need for buildings and settlements to educate occupants leed canadaedit in 2003 the canada green building council received permission to create leed canada-nc v1.0 which was based upon leed-nc 2.0 20 21 many buildings in canada are leed certified in part due to their rainwater harvesting practices processedit leed certification is granted by the green building certification institute gbci which handles the third-party verification of a projects compliance with the leed requirements the certification process for design teams is made up of two consecutive applications one including design credits and one including construction credits all of the leed credits in each rating system are assigned to either the design application or the construction application the design credits include those that are the purview of the architect and the engineer and are documented in the official construction drawings the construction credits include those that are predominantly under the purview of the contractor and are documented during the construction and commissioning of the building a fee is required to register the building and to submit the design and construction applications total fees are assessed based on building area fees range from a minimum of $2,900 to over $1 million for a large project 22 soft costs ie added costs to the building project to quality for leed certification range from 1 to 6 of the total project cost the average cost increase was about 2 or an extra $3$5 per square foot 23 the application review and certification process is handled on leed online usgbcs web-based service that employs a series of active pdf forms to allow project teams to fill out credit forms and upload supporting documentation online the gbci also utilizes leed online to conduct their reviews leed energy modelingedit design teams have the option of achieving points under the optimize energy performance credit by building an energy model this energy model must follow the modeling methodologies outlined in appendix g of the ashrae 90.1 building energy standard the guidelines in appendix g require that the team make two energy models one representing the building as designed and a second baseline building the baseline building must be modeled in the same location and have the same geometry and occupancy as the design building depending on location climate and building size the standard provides requirements for hvac system type and wall and window definitions the goal of this methodology is to provide a baseline building to use as a reference point to compare the design building against it is a way to standardize the baseline while putting weight on important factors that heavily influence building energy consumption eg location geometry and occupancy patterns the number of points achieved in this credit is correlated with the percent predicted energy cost savings demonstrated by the difference between the design and baseline energy models this method of energy modeling has been criticized for inaccurately predicting actually energy usage of leed-certified buildings the usgbc admits that current information indicates that most buildings do not perform as well as design metrics indicate as a result building owners might not obtain the benefits promised 24 leed for homes rating systemedit today increasing demand towards environment safety force leed certification to play major role the process of the leed for homes rating system available in the usa 25 canada and sweden 26 is significantly different from the leed nc rating system leed for homes projects are low rise residential and are required to work with either an american provider organization 27 or a canadian provider organization 28 and a green rater a provider organization helps the project through the process while overseeing the green raters green raters are individuals that conduct the two mandatory leed for homes site inspections the thermal bypass inspection and the final inspection although leed for homes is typically viewed by the construction industry as a simpler rating system especially when compared to leed nc leed nc does not require an on-site inspection the provider and the green rater do not certify the project but rather assist in the certification process leed performanceedit research papers provide most of what is known about the performance and effectiveness of leed in two credit category areas  energy and indoor environment quality in one study of 953 nyc office buildings 21 leed certified buildings collectively showed no energy savings compared with non-leed buildings although leed gold buildings outperformed other nyc office buildings by 20 29 ieq-related studies provide two contrasting results - the first used occupant survey results in 65 leed buildings and 79 non-leed buildings and it concluded that occupants of leed certified buildings have equal satisfaction with the building overall and with the workspace than occupants of non-leed rated buildings 30 and the second used occupant interviews and physical site measurements at 12 leed buildings to report superior indoor environment performance compared with similar 12 conventional buildings non-leed 31 buildings certified under leed do not have to prove energy or water efficiency in practice to receive leed certification points but instead leed uses modeling software to predict future energy use based on intended use this has led to criticism of leeds ability to accurately determine the efficiency of buildings the usgbc itself says that buildings have a poor track record for performing as predicted during design 24 energy performance researchedit in 2009 newsham et al analyzed a database of 100 leed-certified buildings 32 in this study each building was paired with a conventional twin building within the commercial building energy consumption survey cbecs database according to building type and occupancy 32 on average leed buildings consumed 18 to 39 less energy than their conventional twin building although 28 to 35 of leed-certified buildings used more energy than their twin 32 the paper found no correlation between the number of energy points achieved or leed certification level and measured building performance 32 in 2009 scofield published an article in response to newsham et al analyzing the same database of leed buildings and arriving at different conclusions 33 in his analysis scofield considered source energy accounting for energy losses during generation and transmission as well as site energy and used area-weighted energy use intensities or euis energy per unit area per year when comparing leed and non-leed buildings to account for the fact that larger buildings tend to have larger euis 33 scofield concluded that collectively the leed-certified buildings showed no significant source energy consumption savings or greenhouse gas emission reductions when compared to non-leed buildings although they did consume 10-17 less site energy 33 scofield in 2013 analyzed 21 leed-certified buildings in new york city 29 he found that buildings that had achieved leed gold used on average 20 less source energy than did conventional buildings buildings with leed silver or leed certified ratings actually used 11 to 15 more source energy on average than did their conventional counterparts 29 stoppel and leite 34 developed a study in 2013 to evaluate the predicted and actual energy consumption of two twin buildings using the energy model process documented during the leed design phase and the utility meter data after 12 months of occupancy the authors found that energy model predicted 14 and 25 more energy consumption for each building compared to the actual buildings energy use the studys results suggests that mechanical systems turnover and occupancy assumptions significantly differing from predicted to actual values in 2014 fuertes and schiavon 35 developed the first study that analyzes plug loads using leed documented data from certified projects the study compared plug load assumptions made by 92 energy modeling practitioners against ashrae and title 24 requirements as well as the evaluation of the plug loads calculation methodology used by 660 leed-ci and 429 leed-nc certified projects in general energy modelers considered the energy consumption of plug loads of equipment that are constantly running such as refrigerators as well as monitors and computes predictable overall the results suggested a disconnection between energy modelers assumptions and the actual performance of buildings the study also shows that there was no consistency on the method used by leed-ci and nc projects while one is based on the power and percentage of energy star equipment installed in the building the other one is based on a whole-building-design energy model in conclusion the study suggests leed or ashrae to develop guidelines for plug loads calculations water performance researchedit ieq performance researchedit the center for disease control defines indoor environmental quality ieq as the quality of a buildings environment in relation to the health and wellbeing of those who occupy space within it 36 the usgbc includes the following considerations for attaining ieq credits indoor air quality the level of volatile organic compounds lighting thermal comfort and daylighting and views in consideration of a buildings indoor environmental quality published studies have also included factors such as acoustics building cleanliness and maintenance colors and textures workstation size ceiling height window access and shading surface finishes and furniture adjustability and comfort 30 31 in 2013 a paper published by s schiavon and s altomonte studied leed verses non-leed buildings in relation to occupant ieq satisfaction 30 using occupant surveys from the center for the built environment at berkeley database 37 65 leed-certified and 79 non-leed buildings were studied to provide an analysis of 15 ieq-related factors in the overall building and specific workspaces these factors include the ease of interaction building cleanliness the comfort of furnishing the amount of light building maintenance colors and textures workplace cleanliness the amount of space furniture adjustability visual comfort air quality visual privacy noise temperature and sound privacy the results showed occupants tend to be slightly more satisfied in leed buildings for the air quality and slightly more dissatisfied with the amount of light the overall finding was that there was no significant influence of leed certification on occupant satisfaction in consideration of the overall building and workspace ratings 30 the limitations and further studies section states that the data may not be representative of the entire building stock and a randomized approach was not used in the data assessment furthermore an analysis across the various certification types eg new construction existing buildings etc by version release eg 2.1 is recommended based on similar dataset  21,477 occupants in 2013 schiavon and altomonte 38 found that occupants have equivalent satisfaction levels in leed and non-leed buildings when evaluated independently from the following nine factors  1 office type  2 spatial layout  3 distance from windows  4 building size  5 gender  6 age  7 type of work  8 time at workspace and  9 weekly working hours conversely in 2015 a study on indoor environmental quality and the potential health benefits of green certified buildings was developed by allen et al 39 showing that green buildings provide better indoor environmental quality with direct benefits to human health of occupants of those buildings in comparison to non-green buildings one of the limitations of the study was the use of subjective health performance indicators since there is a lack of definition on such indicators by current studies g newsham et al published a detailed study on ieq and leed buildings in august 2013 31 field studies and post-occupancy evaluations poe were performed in 12 green and 12 conventional buildings across canada and the northern united states on-site 974 workstations were measured for thermal conditions air quality acoustics lighting workstation size ceiling height window access and shading and surface finishes responses were positive in the areas of environmental satisfaction satisfaction with thermal conditions satisfaction with view from the outside aesthetic appearance reduced disturbance from heating ventilation and air-conditioning noise workplace image night-time sleep quality mood physical symptoms and reduced number of airborne particulates the results showed green buildings exhibited superior performance compared with similar conventional buildings 31 for leed bdc v4 credit the ieq category addresses thermal visual and acoustic comfort as well as indoor air quality the thermal comfort credit applies one point to the following certification types new construction schools retail data centers warehouses and distribution centers hospitality and healthcare the intent of this credit is to promote occupants productivity comfort and well-being by providing thermal comfort 40 occupants satisfaction and performance is directly affected by a buildings thermal conditions as shown by laboratory and field research 41 energy reduction goals can be supported while improving thermal satisfaction for example research has shown providing occupants control over the thermostat or operable window allows for comfort across a wider range of temperatures 42 43 the following steps are guidelines provided by the usgbc for leed credit in thermal comfort 40 first thermal comfort goals must be established by determining if indoor thermal variation is acceptable or if it must be tightly controlled and if natural conditioning is a benefit desired by the occupants based on those goals a system must be chosen that considers if natural conditioning can fit the project then thermal controls should be established that give the occupant control over air speed operative temperature radiant temperature and humidity such as ceiling fans thermostats operable windows underfloor diffusers etc 40 finally a standard must be chosen that best fits the project from ashrae standard 55-2013 44 iso 7730-2005 45 or en15251-2007 40 46 the daylight credit was updated in leed v4 to include a simulation option for daylight analysis that uses spatial daylight autonomy sda and annual sunlight exposure ase metrics to evaluate daylight quality in leed projects sda is a metric that measures the annual sufficiency of daylight levels in interior spaces and ase describes the potential for visual discomfort by direct sunlight and glare these metrics are approved by ies and described at the lm-83-12 standard 47 leed recommend a minimum of 300 lux for at least 50 of total occupied hours of the year for 55 or more square meters square feet of the floor occupied area the threshold recommended by leed for ase is that no more than 10 of regularly occupied floor area can be exposed to more than 1000 lux of direct sunlight for more than 250 hours per year additionally leed requires window shades to be closed when more than 2 of a space is subject to direct sunlight above 1000 lux according to reinhart 48 the direct sunlight requirement is a very stringent approach that can disable good daylight design from achieving this credit reinhart propose the application of the direct sunlight criterion only in spaces that require stringent control of sunlight eg desks white boards and etc sustainable sites researchedit materials and resources researchedit innovation in design researchedit other related research notesedit a 2003 analysis of the savings from green building found from a review of 60 leed buildings that the buildings were on average 25-30 more energy efficient however it also attributed substantial benefits to the increased productivity from the better ventilation temperature control lighting control and reduced indoor air pollution 49 as of 2008 leed and similar energy star buildings had mostly been evaluated by case studies from a purely financial perspective in 2008 several studies found that leed for-rent office spaces generally charged higher rent and had higher occupancy rates costar collects data on properties the extra cost for the minimum benefit has been estimated at 3 with an additional 2.5 for silver 50 more recent studies have confirmed these earlier findings in that certified buildings achieve significantly higher rents sale prices and occupancy rates as well as lower capitalization rates potentially reflecting lower investment risk 51 52 53 leed focuses on the design of the building and not on its actual energy consumption and therefore it has suggested that leed buildings should be tracked to discover whether the potential energy savings from the design are being used in practice 54 directory of leed-certified projectsedit the us green building council provides an online directory of us leed-certified projects 9 the canada green building council provides an online directory 55 of leed canada-certified projects in 2012 the usgbc launched gbig the green building information gateway 56 in an effort to connect green building efforts and projects from all over the world it provides searchable access to a database of activities buildings places and collections of green building-related information from many sources and programs as well as specifically provides information about leed projects professional accreditationedit the green building certification institute describes professional accreditation as follows leed professional credentials demonstrate current knowledge of green building technologies best practices and the rapidly evolving leed rating systems they show differentiation in a growing and competitive industry and they allow for varied levels of specialization a leed professional credential provides employers policymakers and other stakeholders with assurances of an individuals level of competence and is the mark of the most qualified educated and influential green building professionals in the marketplace 57 credentials include the leed green associate and the various types of specialized leed accredited professionals ap benefits and disadvantagesedit leed certified buildings are intended to use resources more efficiently when compared to conventional buildings simply built to code however analysis of energy and water use data from new york city shows that leed certification does not necessarily make a building more energy or water efficient 58 often when a leed rating is pursued the cost of initial design and construction rises there may be a lack of abundant availability of manufactured building components that meet leed specifications pursuing leed certification for a project is an added cost in itself as well this added cost comes in the form of usgbc correspondence leed design-aide consultants and the hiring of the required commissioning authority cxaall of which would not necessarily be included in an environmentally responsible project unless it also sought a leed ratingcitation needed however these higher initial costs can be effectively mitigated by the savings incurred over time due to the lower-than-industry-standard operational costs typical of a leed certified building this life cycle costing is a method for assessing the total cost of ownership taking into account all costs of acquiring owning and operating and the eventual disposal of a building additional economic payback may come in the form of employee productivity gains incurred as a result of working in a healthier environment studies suggest that an initial up-front investment of 2 extra yields over ten times that initial investment over the life cycle of the building 59 further the usgbc has stated support for the architecture 2030 an effort that has set a goal of using no fossil-fuel greenhouse-gas-emitting energy to operate by 2030 60 in the progression of sustainable design from simply meeting local buildings codes to usgbc leed 61 certified silver gold and platinum to the architecture 2030 challenge 62 the living building challenge is currently the most stringent sustainable design protocol the lbc 63 sets 20 imperatives that compel building owners designers operators and tenants beyond current usgbc 64 leed rating levels leed is a design tool and not a performance measurement tool it is also not yet climate-specific although the newest version hopes to address this weakness partially because of this designers may make materials or design choices that garner a leed point even though they may not be the most site- or climate-appropriate choice available on top of this leed is also not energy-specific since it only measures the overall performances builders are free to choose how to achieve points under various categories a usa today review showed that 7,100 certified commercial building projects targeted easy and cheap green points such as creating healthy spaces and providing educational displays in the building 65 few builders would really adopt renewable energy because the generators for those energy resources such as solar photovoltaic are costly builders game the rating system and use certain performances to compensate for the others making energy conservation the weakest part in the overall evaluation leed is a measurement tool for green building in the united states and it is developed and continuously modified by workers in the green building industry especially in the ten largest metro areas in the us however leed certified buildings have been slower to penetrate small and mid-major markets 66 also some criticism suggests that the leed rating system is not sensitive and does not vary enough with regard to local environmental conditions for instance a building in maine would receive the same credit as a building in arizona for water conservation though the principle is more important in the latter case another complaint is that its certification costs require money that could be used to make the building in question even more sustainable many critics have noted that compliance and certification costs have grown faster than staff support from the usgbc for existing buildings leed has developed leed-eb research has demonstrated that buildings that can achieve leed-eb equivalencies can generate a tremendous roicitation needed in a 2008 white paper by the leonardo academy comparing leed-eb buildings vs data from bomas experience exchange report 2007 demonstrated leed-eb certified buildings achieved superior operating cost savings in 63 of the buildings surveyed ranging from $4.94 to $15.59 per square foot of floor space with an average valuation of $6.68 and a median valuation of $6.07 67 in addition the overall cost of leed-eb implementation and certification ranged from $0.00 to $6.46 per square foot of floor space with an average of $2.43 per square foot demonstrating that implementation is not expensive especially in comparison to cost savings these costs should be significantly reduced if automation and technology are integrated into the implementation incentive programsedit many federal state and local governments and school districts have adopted various types of leed initiatives and incentives a full listing of government and school leed initiatives can be found online 68 and is updated regularly some areas have implemented or are considering incentives for leed-certified buildings the city of cincinnati ohio adopted a measure providing an automatic 100 real property tax exemption of the assessed property value for newly constructed or rehabilitated commercial or residential properties that earn a minimum of leed certified 69 in the state of nevada construction materials for a qualifying leed building are exempt from local taxes pieces of construction that are deemed inseparable parts such as concrete or drywall qualify the state of maryland passed its high performance buildings act in 2008 requiring all new public construction and renovation of buildings greater than 7,500 square feet to meet at least the leed silver standard or two green globes between 2009 and 2014 the state is required to fund half of the required additional cost for public school construction or renovation to attain that standard 70 the state of michigan is considering tax-based incentives for leed buildings 71 many local governments have adopted leed incentive programs program incentives include tax credits tax breaks density bonuses reduced fees priority or expedited permitting free or reduced-cost technical assistance grants and low-interest loans 72 in june 2013 the usgbc announced a program called leed earth that refunds leed certification fees to the first leed-certified project in the countries that so far lack one 73 74 notable leed buildingsedit the philip merrill environmental center is recognized as one of the greenest buildings ever constructed in the united states at the time when it was built sustainability issues ranging from energy use to material selection were given serious consideration throughout design and construction of this facility it was the first building to receive a platinum rating through the us green building councils leed rating system version 1.0 75 when it opened in 2003 pittsburghs 1,500,000-square-foot  140,000m2 david l lawrence convention center was the first gold leed-certified convention center and largest green building in the world 76 the convention center subsequently earned platinum certification in 2012 becoming the only convention center in the world with certifications for both the original building and new construction 1 in october 2011 apogee stadium on the campus of the university of north texas became the first newly built stadium in the country to achieve platinum-level certification in pittsburgh phipps conservatory  botanical gardens visitors center has received a silver certification 77 its center for sustainable landscapes has received a platinum certification along with fulfilling the living building challenge for net-zero energy 4 and its greenhouse production facility has received platinum certification the first and only greenhouse so certified 3 also in pittsburgh sota construction services completed construction on its new 7,500 sq ft corporate headquarters 78 which features a super-efficient thermal envelope using cob walls along with other energy-saving features like a geothermal well radiant heat flooring roof-mounted solar panel array and daylighting features it earned a leed platinum rating in 2012 and received one of the highest scores by percentage of total points earned in any leed category making it the greenest building in pennsylvania and in the top ten greenest in the world 79 around 2009–2010 the empire state building was undergoing a $550million renovation with $120million spent in an effort to transform the building into a more energy efficient and eco-friendly structure 80 receiving a gold leed rating in september 2011 the empire state building was at the time the tallest leed-certified building in the united states 81 the coastal maine botanical gardens bosarge family education center completed in 2011 achieved leed platinum certification and has become known as maines greenest building 82 in may 2012 soldier field in chicago became the first national football league stadium certified leed 83 in july 2014 the san francisco 49ers levis stadium in san francisco became the first venue in the united states to earn a leed gold certification setting the bar and expectations for future nfl stadiums the minnesota vikings look to match and exceed the expectations set by the 49ers when they open us bank stadium in 2016 the cashman equipment building is the first construction equipment dealership to receive leed certification it is the largest leed industrial complex in nevada caterpillar corporate has rewritten their development guidelines for new facilities based on this building 84 the letterman digital arts center in san franciscos presidio the headquarters for various lucasfilm companies including visual effects house industrial light and magic earned a gold certification it was built almost entirely from the recycled remains of the building it replaced the letterman army hospital 85 the cuyahoga county public library system is building newer branches so that they could be leed certified in the construction of the garfield heights ohio new branch the library used green materials the lighting of garfield heights branch lightens or dims when there is ample daylight the glass windows have light sensors that work with lights inside the library also the library uses a raised floor and has recyclable carpet tiles opening in september 2012 siemens the crystal became the worlds first building awarded leed platinum and breeam outstanding status 86 generating its own energy using solar power and ground source heat pumps no fossil fuels are burnt within the building its extensive use of knx technologies to automate the buildings environmental controls has set the benchmark for sustainable buildings 87 when it received leed platinum in 2012 manitoba hydro place in downtown winnipeg manitoba was the most energy efficient office tower in north america and the only office tower in canada to receive the platinum rating the office tower employs south facing winter gardens to capture the maximum amount of solar energy during the harsh manitoba winters and uses glass extensively to maximise natural light 88 see alsoedit leadership in
