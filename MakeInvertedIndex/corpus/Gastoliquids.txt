gas to liquids gas to liquids gtl is a refinery process to convert natural gas or other gaseous hydrocarbons into longer-chain hydrocarbons such as gasoline or diesel fuel methane-rich gases are converted into liquid synthetic fuels either via direct conversionusing non-catalytic processes that convert methane to methanol in one stepor via syngas as an intermediate such as in the fischer tropsch mobil and syngas to gasoline plus processes  contents 1 fischertropsch process 2 methane to methanol process 3 methanol to gasoline process mtg 4 syngas to gasoline plus process stg 5 commercial uses 6 see also 7 references 8 external links  fischertropsch processedit the fischertropsch process starts with partial oxidation of methane natural gas to carbon dioxide carbon monoxide hydrogen gas and water the ratio of carbon monoxide to hydrogen is adjusted using the water gas shift reaction while the excess carbon dioxide is removed with aqueous solutions of alkanolamines or physical solvents removing the water yields synthesis gas syngas which is chemically reacted over an iron or cobalt catalyst to produce liquid hydrocarbons and other byproducts oxygen is provided from a cryogenic air separation unit methane to methanol processedit methanol is made from methane natural gas in a series of three reactions the methanol thus formed may be converted to gasoline by the mobil process methanol to gasoline process mtgedit in the early 1970s mobil developed an alternative procedure in which natural gas is converted to syngas and then methanol the methanol polymerized over a zeolite catalyst to form alkanes first methanol is dehydrated to give dimethyl ether this is then further dehydrated over a zeolite catalyst such as zsm-5 which would theoretically yield ethylene but which in practice is polymerized and hydrogenated to give a gasoline with hydrocarbons of five or more carbon atoms making up 80 of the fuel by weight syngas to gasoline plus process stgedit a third gas-to-liquids process builds on the mtg technology by converting natural gas-derived syngas directly into drop-in gasoline and jet fuel via a thermochemical single-loop process 1 the stg process follows four principal steps in one continuous process loop this process consists of four fixed bed reactors in series in which a syngas is converted to synthetic fuels the steps for producing high-octane synthetic gasoline are as follows 2 commercial usesedit using gas-to-liquids processes refineries can convert some of their gaseous waste products flare gas into valuable fuel oils which can be sold as is or blended only with diesel fuel the world bank estimates that over 150billion cubic metres  5.3Ã—10 ^12cuft of natural gas are flared or vented annually an amount worth approximately $30.6billion equivalent to 25 of the united states gas consumption or 30 of the european unions annual gas consumption 3 a resource that could be useful using gtl gas-to-liquids processes may also be used for the economic extraction of gas deposits in locations where it is not economical to build a pipeline this process will be increasingly significant as crude oil resources are depleted the use of microchannel reactors such as those developed by velocys shows promise for the conversion of unconventional remote and problem gas into valuable liquid fuels gtl plants based on microchannel reactors are significantly smaller than those using conventional fixed bed or slurry bed reactors enabling modular plants that can be deployed cost effectively in remote locations and on smaller fields than is possible with competing systems 4 construction is underway for one such plant envia energys oklahoma city gtl plant being built adjacent to waste managements east oak landfill site the project is being financed by a joint venture between waste management nrg energy ventech and velocys the feedstock for this plant will be a combination of landfill gas and pipeline natural gas  5 on august 1 2014 biofuels power corporation bfls signed a letter of intent with thyssenkrupp industrial solutions and liberty gtl inc to build a small scale gas-to-liquid demonstration facility in houstontexas 6 the parties have established a non-binding target date to complete installation and commissioning of the gtl pilot plant on or before december 31 2014 the purpose of the gtl pilot plant is to commercially demonstrate converting stranded natural gas resources to synthetic crude oil bfls will operate the gtl pilot plant for the 2-year demonstration thyssenkrupp will provide technical services and contribute a previously operating auto-thermal reformer pilot plant of proven design atr which will be used to generate synthesis gas feedstock for the production of synthetic crude oil liberty will provide intellectual property and operating know-how regarding crude oil synthesis along with the relevant catalyst supply the liberty technical team is also credited for designing the ft fischer tropsch reactor which will convert the synthetic gas to synthetic crude oil the gtl pilot plant will be assembled at the houston clean energy park 7 which is an industrial estate owned by bfls the houston site is located between the eagle ford natural gas field and numerous refineries one other proposed solution is to use a novel fpso for offshore conversion of gas to liquids such as methanol diesel petrol synthetic crude and naphtha 8 two companies sasol and royal dutch shell have technology proven to work on a commercial scale petrosa completed semi-commercial demonstrations of gas-to-liquids used by the company in 2011 9 royal dutch shell produces a diesel from natural gas in a factory in bintulu malaysia another shell gtl facility is the pearl gtl plant in qatar the worlds largest gtl facility and there are reports that shell is looking at the feasibility of a gtl facility in louisiana us 10 11 12 sasol has recently built the oryx gtl facility in ras laffan industrial city qatar and together with uzbekneftegaz and petronas builds the uzbekistan gtl plant 13 14 15 chevron corporation in a joint venture with the nigerian national petroleum corporation is commissioning the escravos gtl in nigeria which uses sasol technology on 1 february 2008 an airbus a380 flew a three-hour test flight between britain and france with one of the a380s four rolls-royce trent 900 engines using a mix of 60 standard jet kerosene and 40 gas to liquids fuel supplied by shell 16 the aircraft engine needed no modification to use the gtl fuel which was designed to be mixed with normal jet fuel the fuel used was no cleaner in co2 terms than standard fuel but it had local air quality benefits because the gtl portion contains no sulphur 17 on 12 october 2009 a qatar airways airbus a340-600 conducted the worlds first commercial passenger flight using a mixture of kerosene and synthetic gtl fuel in its flight from londons gatwick airport to doha 18 brazilian oil company petrobras has ordered two small experimental gtl production facilities intended to be posted at offshore oil fields too distant or deep to justify gas pipelines to onshore gtl plant 19 20 21 in january 2012 petrobras cenpes research and development centre approved for commercial deployment the technology supplied by uk-based gas-to-liquids company compactgtl 22 petrobras has also completed its assessment of technology supplied by velocys 19 the stg technology is currently operating at pre-commercial scale in hillsborough new jersey at a plant owned by alternative fuels company primus green energy the plant produces approximately 100,000 gallons of high-quality drop-in gasoline per year directly from natural gas 23 further the company announced the findings of an independent engineers report prepared by e3 consulting which found that stg system and catalyst performance exceeded expectations during plant operation the pre-commercial demonstration plant has also achieved 720 hours of continuous operation 24 on march 2 2016 infra technology llc held a ground-breaking ceremony for the construction of its innovative modular 100 bpd gtl plant mark100 in wharton texas in close proximity to houston the plant will be producing synthetic crude from natural gas it will serve as a demonstration of infras proprietary technology which provides
