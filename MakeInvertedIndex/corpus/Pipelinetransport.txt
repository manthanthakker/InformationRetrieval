pipeline transport air cable land animal-powered human-powered rail road pipeline space water animal-powered human-powered rail road history timeline outline timeline v t e pipeline transport is the transportation of goods or material through a pipe the latest data in 2014 gives a total of slightly less than 2,175,000 miles  3,500,000km of pipeline in 120 countries of the world 1 the united states had 65 russia had 8 and canada had 3 thus 75 of all pipeline was in three countries 1 pipeline and gas journals worldwide survey figures indicate that 118,623 miles  190,905km of pipelines are planned and under construction of these 88,976 miles  143,193km represent projects in the planning and design phase 29,647 miles  47,712km reflect pipelines in various stages of construction liquids and gases are transported in pipelines and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline 2 pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum fuels - such as oil natural gas and biofuels - and other fluids including sewage slurry water and beer pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact pneumatic tubes using compressed air can be used to transport solid capsules oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes which are usually buried the oil is moved through the pipelines by pump stations along the pipeline natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurised into liquids known as natural gas liquids ngls natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through long-distance pipelines but accidents have been rare hydrogen pipeline transport is the transportation of hydrogen through a pipe district heating or teleheating systems use a network of insulated pipes which transport heated water pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer pipelines conveying flammable or explosive material such as natural gas or oil pose special safety concerns and there have been various accidents pipelines can be the target of vandalism sabotage or even terrorist attacks in war pipelines are often the target of military attacks  contents 1 oil and

pipeline was built credit for the development of pipeline transport is disputed with competing claims for vladimir shukhov and the branobel company in the late 19th century and the oil transport association which first constructed a 2-inch  51mm wrought iron pipeline over a 6-mile  9.7km track from an oil field in pennsylvania to a railroad station in oil creek in the 1860s pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil refined oil products or natural gas over land natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurized into liquids knows as natural gas liquids ngls small ngl processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of 125 pounds per square inch  860kpa can be shipped by rail truck or pipeline propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch eg propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure 100 psi give or take depending on temperature and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than 125psi  860kpa at retail stations pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at 250psi  1,700kpa the distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter as thousands of ngl processing plants are located in oil fields or close by when a number of pipelines tie into each other from various relatively close fields many bakken basin oil companies in north dakota montana manitoba and saskatchewan gas fields separate the ngls in the field allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane the most recent major pipeline to start operating in north america is a transcanada natural gas line going north across the niagara region bridges with marcellus shale gas from pennsylvania and others tied in methane or natural gas sources into the canadian province of ontario as of the fall of 2012 supplying 16 percent of all the natural gas used in ontario this new us supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to ontario from western canada in alberta and manitoba thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer compared to shipping by railroad pipelines have lower cost per unit and higher capacity pipelines are preferable to transportation by truck for a number of reasons employment on completed pipelines represents only "1 of that of the trucking industry 3 to avoid delays and us government regulation many small medium and large oil producers in north dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to canada to meet up with a canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east this allows the bakken basin and three forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the us the distance from the biggest oil patch in north dakota is williston north dakota only about 85 miles or 137 kilometers to the canadaus border and manitoba mutual funds and joint ventures are big investors in new oil and gas pipelines in the fall of 2012 the us began exporting propane to europe known as lpg as wholesale prices there are much higher than in north america as more north american pipelines are built even more exports of lng propane butane and other natural gas products will occur on all three us coasts to give insight north dakotas oil production has grown to 5 times in late 2012 compared to what it was just 6 years ago creating thousands of good paying long term jobscitation needed north dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price but pipelines are cheaper rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery enbridge in canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from east-to-west line 9 and expanding it and using it to ship western canadian bitumen oil eastward 4 from a presently rated 250,000 barrels equivalent per day pipeline it will be expanded to between one million to 1.3 million barrels per day it will bring western oil to refineries in ontario michigan ohio pennsylvania quebec and new york by early 2014 new brunswick will also refine some of this western canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to europe from its deep water oil ulcc loading port although pipelines can be built under the sea that process is economically and technically demanding so the majority of oil at sea is transported by tanker ships the enbridge sandpiper pipeline is proposed to transfer valuable oil from western north dakota through northwestern minnesota the pipeline will be 24-30 inches in diameter it will carry over 300,000 barrels of oil a day with a volatility of 32 5 growth of marketedit the market size for oil and gas pipeline construction experienced tremendous growth prior to the economic downturn in 2008 after faltering in 2009 demand for pipeline expansion and updating increased the following year as energy production grew 6 by 2012 almost 32,000 miles of north american pipeline were being planned or under construction 7 construction and operationedit oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes with inner diameter typically from 4 to 48 inches  100 to 1,220mm most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about 3 to 6 feet  0.91 to 1.83m to protect pipes from impact abrasion and corrosion a variety of methods are used these can include wood lagging wood slats concrete coating rockshield high-density polyethylene imported sand padding and padding machines 8 crude oil contains varying amounts of paraffin wax and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using pigging the practice of using devices known as pigs to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline the devices are also known as scrapers or go-devils smart pigs also known as intelligent or intelligence pigs are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents metal loss caused by corrosion cracking or other mechanical damage 9 these devices are launched from pig-launcher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station down-stream either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line for natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from 2 to 60 inches  51 to 1,524mm in diameter depending on the type of pipeline the gas is pressurized by compressor stations and is odorless unless mixed with a mercaptan odorant where required by a regulating authority ammoniaedit highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through long-distance pipelinescitation needed however incidents on ammonia-transporting lines are uncommon - unlike on industrial ammonia-processing equipmentcitation needed a major ammonia pipeline is the ukrainian transammiak line connecting the togliattiazot facility in russia to the exporting black sea-port of odessa alcohol fuelsedit pipelines have been used for transportation of ethanol in brazil and there are several ethanol pipeline projects in brazil and the united states 10 the main problems related to the transport of ethanol by pipeline are its corrosive nature and tendency to absorb water and impurities in pipelines which are not problems with oil and natural gas 10 11 insufficient volumes and cost-effectiveness are other considerations limiting construction of ethanol pipelines 11 12 coal and oreedit slurry pipelines are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines the material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline at the far end the material must be dried one example is a 525-kilometre  326mi slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the minas-rio mine producing 26.5 million tonnes per year to the port of açu in brazil 13 an existing example is the 85-kilometre  53mi savage river slurry pipeline in tasmania australia possibly the worlds first when it was built in 1967 it includes a 366-metre  1,201ft bridge span at 167 metres  548ft above the savage river 14 15 hydrogenedit hydrogen pipeline transport is a transportation of hydrogen through a pipe as part of the hydrogen infrastructure hydrogen pipeline transport is used to connect the point of hydrogen production or delivery of hydrogen with the point of demand with transport costs similar to cng 16 the technology is proven 17 most hydrogen is produced at the place of demand with every 50 to 100 miles  160km an industrial production facility 18 the 1938 rhine-ruhr 240-kilometre  150mi hydrogen pipeline is still in operation 19 as of 2004update there are 900 miles  1,400km of low pressure hydrogen pipelines in the us and 930 miles  1,500km in europe wateredit two millennia ago the ancient romans made use of large aqueducts to transport water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed gravity to push the water along until it reached its destination hundreds of these were built throughout europe and elsewhere and along with flour mills were considered the lifeline of the roman empire the ancient chinese also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works the famous han dynasty court eunuch zhang rang d 189ad once ordered the engineer bi lan to construct a series of square-pallet chain pumps outside the capital city of luoyang 20 these chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a stoneware pipe system 20 21 pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact the 530km  330mi goldfields water supply scheme in western australia using 750mm  30inch pipe and completed in 1903 was the largest water supply scheme of its time 22 23 examples of significant water pipelines in south australia are the morgan-whyalla pipelne completed 1944 and mannum-adelaide completed 1955 pipelines both part of the larger snowy mountains scheme 24 there are two los angeles california aqueducts the owens valley aqueduct completed 1913 and the second los angeles aqueduct completed 1970 which also include extensive use of pipelines the great manmade river of libya supplies 3,680,000 cubic metres  4,810,000cuyd of water each day to tripoli benghazi sirte and several other cities in libya the pipeline is over 2,800 kilometres  1,700mi long and is connected to wells tapping an aquifer over 500 metres  1,600ft underground 25 other systemsedit district heatingedit district heating or teleheating systems consist of a network of insulated feed and return pipes which transport heated water pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer while steam is hottest and may be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature it is less efficient to produce and transport due to greater heat losses heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons the typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around 10 as seen in norways district heating network 27 district heating pipelines are normally installed underground with some exceptions within the system heat storage may be installed to even out peak load demands heat is transferred into the central heating of the dwellings through heat exchangers at heat substations without mixing of the fluids in either system beeredit bars in the veltins-arena a major football ground in gelsenkirchen germany are interconnected by a 5-kilometre  3.1mi long beer pipeline in randers city in denmark the so-called thor beer pipeline was operated originally copper pipes ran directly from the brewery but when the brewery moved out of the city in the 1990s thor beer replaced it with a giant tank a three-kilometer beer pipeline was completed in bruges belgium in september 2016 to reduce truck traffic on the city streets 28 brineedit the village of hallstatt in austria which is known for its long history of salt mining claims to contain the oldest industrial pipeline in the world dating back to 1595 29 it was constructed from 13,000 hollowed-out tree trunks to transport brine 40 kilometres  25mi from hallstatt to ebensee 30 milkedit between 1978 and 1994 a 15km milk pipeline ran between the dutch island of ameland and holwerd on the mainland of which 8km beneath the wadden sea every day 30.000 litres of milk produced on the island were transported to be processed on the mainland in 1994 the milk transport was abandoned 31 marine pipelinesedit in places a pipeline may have to cross water expanses such as small seas straits and rivers 32 in many instances they lie entirely on the seabed these pipelines are referred to as marine pipelines also submarine or offshore pipelines they are used primarily to carry oil or gas but transportation of water is also important 32 in offshore projects a distinction is made between a flowline and a pipeline 32 33 34 the former is an intrafield pipeline in the sense that it is used to connect subsea wellheads manifolds and the platform within a particular development field the latter sometimes referred to as an export pipeline is used to bring the resource to shore 33 the construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland mainly because of wave and current dynamics along with other geohazards functionsedit in general pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose development and planningedit when a pipeline is built the construction project not only covers the civil engineering work to lay the pipeline and build the pumpcompressor stations it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation the pipeline is routed along what is known as a right of way pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages russia has pipeline troops as part of the rear services who are trained to build and repair pipelines russia is the only country to have pipeline troops 36 operationedit field devices are instrumentation data gathering units and communication systems the field instrumentation includes flow pressure and temperature gaugestransmitters and other devices to measure the relevant data required these instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations such as injection or delivery stations pump stations liquid pipelines or compressor stations gas pipelines and block valve stations the information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local remote terminal units rtu that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems such as satellite channels microwave links or cellular phone connections pipelines are controlled and operated remotely from what is usually known as the main control room in this center all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database the data is received from multiple rtus along the pipeline it is common to find rtus installed at every station along the pipeline the scada system at the main control room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or human machine interface showing the operational conditions of the pipeline the operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line as well as send operational commands openclose valves turn onoff compressors or pumps change setpoints etc through the scada system to the field to optimize and secure the operation of these assets some pipeline companies are using what is called advanced pipeline applications which are software tools installed on top of the scada system that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection leak location batch tracking liquid lines pig tracking composition tracking predictive modeling look ahead modeling and operator training technologyedit componentsedit pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location the main elements of a pipeline system are leak detection systemsedit since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets and the population and environment where these pipelines run pipeline companies face government regulation environmental constraints and social situations government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation operator training requirements pipeline facilities technology and applications required to ensure operational safety for example in the state of washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of 8 percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less social factors also affect the operation of pipelines product theft is sometimes also a problem for pipeline companies in this case the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow with a high expectation for location accuracy various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance the most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is computational pipeline monitoring or cpm cpm takes information from the field related to pressures flows and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported once the estimation is completed the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation which may be related to a leak the american petroleum institute has published several articles related to the performance of cpm in liquids pipelines the api publications are ram 1130  computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines api 1155  evaluation methodology for software based leak detection systems api 1149  pipeline variable uncertainties  their effects on leak detectability where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway it is usually enclosed in a protective casing this casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the build-up of flammable gases or corrosive substances and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks the casing vent a pipe protruding from the ground often doubles as a warning marker called a casing vent marker 37 implementationedit as a rule pipelines for all uses are laid in most cases undergroundcitation needed however in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a pipeline bridge pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as trans-alaska-pipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground maintenanceedit maintenance of pipelines includes checking cathodic protection levels for the proper range surveillance for construction erosion or leaks by foot land vehicle boat or air and running cleaning pigs when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive us pipeline maintenance rules are covered in code of federal regulationscfr sections 49 cfr 192 for natural gas pipelines and 49 cfr 195 for petroleum liquid pipelines regulationedit in the us onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the minerals management service mms in canada pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or if they cross provincial boundaries or the canadaus border by the national energy board neb government regulations in canada and the united states require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from corrosion often the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline coating in conjunction with cathodic protection and technology to monitor the pipeline above ground cathodic protection is not an option the coating is the only external protection pipelines and geopoliticsedit pipelines for major energy resources petroleum and natural gas are not merely an element of trade they connect to issues of geopolitics and international security as well and the construction placement and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in state interests and actions a notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year 2009 wherein a dispute between russia and ukraine ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis russian state-owned gas company gazprom cut off natural gas supplies to ukraine after talks between it and the ukrainian government fell through in addition to cutting off supplies to ukraine russian gas flowing through ukrainewhich included nearly all supplies to southeastern europe and some supplies to central and western europewas cut off creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on russian gas as fuel russia was accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers and particularly the european union from interfering in its near abroad oil and gas pipelines also figure prominently in the politics of central asia and the caucasus hazard identificationedit because the solvent fraction of dilbit typically comprises volatile aromatics like naptha and benzene reasonably rapid carrier vaporization can be expected to follow an above-ground spillostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a viscous residue that is slow to migrate effective protocols to minimize exposure to petrochemical vapours are well-established and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the aquifer unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier eg a series of torrential downpours the keystone xl extension is designed to be buried under four feet of soil which will hinder post-spill vaporization of the carrier fraction diluent and bitumen will migrate at different rates depending on the temperature- and composition of the surrounding soils but separation will take place more slowly as the aromatics diffuse through sediment rather than through air the introduction of benzene and other volatile organic compounds collectively btex to the subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak particularly if followed by rain a pipeline breach would result in btex dissolution and equilibration of benzene in water followed by percolation of the admixture into the aquifer benzene can cause many health problems and is carcinogenic with epa maximum contaminant level mcl set at 5 μgl for potable water 38 although it is not well studied single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute carcinogenesis 39 additionally the exposure of livestock mainly cattle to benzene has been shown to cause many health issues such as neurotoxicity fetal damage and fatal poisoning 40 the entire surface of an above-ground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach pooled petroleum is unambiguous readily spotted and indicates the location of required repairs because the effectiveness of remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment gaps between sensors and data that requires interpretation small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks buried pipes draw fewer complaints they are insulated from extremes in ambient temperature they are shielded from ultraviolet rays and they are less exposed to photodegradation buried pipes are isolated from airborne debris electrical storms tornadoes hurricanes hail and acid rain they are protected from nesting birds rutting mammals and wayward buckshot buried pipe is less vulnerable to accident damage eg automobile collisions and less accessible to vandals saboteurs and terrorists exposureedit previous work 41 has shown that a worst-case exposure scenario can be limited to a specific set of conditions based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shut-off sop developed by transcanada the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely 42 detection shutoff and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene therefore the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the limit of detection and go unnoticed for extended periods of time 41 leak detection is monitored through a scada system that assesses pressure and volume flow every 5 seconds a pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the scada system <1.5 flow could accumulate into a substantive spill 42 detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or olfactory inspection aerial surveying or mass-balance inconsistencies 42 it is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the 14-day inspection interval however snow cover and location eg remote deep could delay detection benzene typically makes up 0.1  1.0 of oil and will have varying degrees of volatility and dissolution based on environmental factors even with pipeline leak volumes within scada detection limits sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions or other problems the enbridge line 6b crude oil pipeline failure in marshall michigan on july 25 2010 was thought by operators in edmonton to be from column separation of the dilbit in that pipeline the leak in wetlands along the kalamazoo river was only confirmed 17 hours after it happened by a local gas company employee in michigan spill frequency-volumeedit although the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa has standard baseline incident frequencies to estimate the number of spills transcanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline design operation and safety 42 whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these assumptions resulted in a nearly 10-fold decrease in spill estimates 41 given that the pipeline crosses 247 miles of the ogallala aquifer 43 or 14.5 of the entire pipeline length and the 50-year life of the entire pipeline is expected to have between 11  91 spills 41 approximately 1.6  13.2 spills can be expected to occur over the aquifer an estimate of 13.2 spills over the aquifer each lasting 14 days results in 184 days of potential exposure over the 50 year lifetime of the pipeline in the reduced scope worst case exposure scenario the volume of a pinhole leak at 1.5 of max flow-rate for 14 days has been estimated at 189,000 barrels or 7.9 million gallons of oil 41 according to phmsas incident database 44 only 0.5 of all spills in the last 10 years were >10,000 barrels benzene fate and transportedit benzene is considered a light aromatic hydrocarbon with high solubility and high volatilityclarification needed it is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of benzene so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil  1 weight by volume would not volatilize before equilibrating with water 41 using the octanol-water partition coefficient and a 100-year precipitation event for the area a worst-case estimate of 75mgl of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the aquifer 41 the actual movement of the plume through groundwater systems is not well described although one estimate is that up to 4.9 billion gallons of water in the ogallala aquifer could become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the mcl 41 the final environmental impact statement from the state department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most benzene will volatilize 42 previous dilbit spill remediation difficultiesedit one of the major concerns about dilbit is the difficulty in cleaning it up 45 enbridges line 6b a 30-inch crude oil pipeline ruptured in marshall michigan on july 25 2010 mentioned above spilled at least 843,000 gallons of dilbit 46 after detection of the leak booms and vacuum trucks were deployed heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams and carried dilbit 30 miles downstream before the spill was contained remediation work collected over 1.1 million gallons of oil and almost 200,000 cubic yards of oil-contaminated sediment and debris from the kalamazoo river system however oil was still being found in affected waters in october 2012 47 dangersedit accidentsedit pipelines conveying flammable or explosive material such as natural gas or oil pose special safety concerns 1965 - a 32-inch gas transmission pipeline north of natchitoches louisiana belonging to the tennessee gas pipeline exploded and burned
