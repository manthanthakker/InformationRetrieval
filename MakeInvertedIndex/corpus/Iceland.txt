iceland 92.61icelandic 1 3.36polish 4.01other the republic of iceland iˈaɪslænd icelandic ísland ˈistlant lýðveldið ísland in icelandic is a nordic island country in the north atlantic ocean it has a population of 332,529 and an area of 103,000km2  40,000sqmi making it the most sparsely populated country in europe 7 the capital and largest city is reykjavík reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population iceland is volcanically and geologically active the interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields mountains and glaciers while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands iceland is warmed by the gulf stream and has a temperate climate despite a high latitude just outside the arctic circle its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate according to landnámabók the settlement of iceland began in the year 874 ce when the norwegian chieftain ingólfr arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island 8 in the following centuries norwegians and to a lesser extent other scandinavians immigrated to iceland bringing with them thralls of gaelic origin the island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the althing one of the worlds oldest functioning legislative assemblies following a period of civil strife iceland acceded to norwegian rule in the 13th century in 1814 it came under the rule of denmark during which a distinct icelandic national identity emerged this culminated in independence in 1918 and the founding of a republic in 1944 until the 20th century iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture and was among the poorest in europe industrialisation of the fisheries and marshall plan aid following world war ii brought prosperity and iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world in 1994 it became a part of the european economic area which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance biotechnology and manufacturing iceland has a market economy with relatively low taxes compared to other oecd countries 9 it maintains a nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens 10 iceland ranks high in economic political and social stability and equality in 2013 it was ranked as the 13th most-developed country in the world by the united nations human development index 6 iceland runs almost completely on renewable energy affected by the ongoing worldwide financial crisis the nations entire banking system systemically failed in october 2008 leading to a severe depression substantial political unrest the icesave dispute and the institution of capital controls many bankers were jailed 11 and the economy has made a significant recovery in large part due to a surge in tourism 12 13 14 icelandic culture is founded upon the nations scandinavian heritage most icelanders are descendants of germanic and gaelic settlers icelandic a north germanic language is descended from old norse and is closely related to faroese and west norwegian dialects the countrys cultural heritage includes traditional icelandic cuisine icelandic literature and medieval sagas iceland has the smallest population of any nato member and is the only one with no standing army its lightly armed coast guard being in charge of defence 15  contents 1 history 1.1 settlement and commonwealth 874–1262 1.2 the middle ages 1.3 reformation and the early

sport  historyedit settlement and commonwealth 874–1262edit according to both landnámabók and íslendingabók celtic monks known as the papar lived in iceland before scandinavian settlers arrived possibly members of a hiberno-scottish mission recent archaeological excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in hafnir on the reykjanes peninsula carbon dating indicates that it was abandoned sometime between 770 and 880 16 in 2016 archeologists uncovered a longhouse in stöðvarfjörður that has been dated to as early as the year 800 17 swedish viking explorer garðar svavarsson was the first to circumnavigate iceland in 870 and establish that it was an island 18 he stayed over winter and built a house in húsavík garðar departed the following summer but one of his men náttfari decided to stay behind with two slaves náttfari settled in what is now known as náttfaravík and he and his slaves became the first permanent residents of iceland 19 20 the norwegian-norse chieftain ingólfr arnarson built his homestead in present-day reykjavík in the year 874 ingólfr was followed by many other emigrant settlers largely scandinavians and their thralls many of whom were irish or scottish 21 by 930 most arable land on the island had been claimed the althing a legislative and judicial assembly was initiated to regulate the icelandic commonwealth lack of arable land also served impetus to the settlement of greenland starting in 986 22 the period of these early settlements coincided with the medieval warm period when temperatures were similar to those of the early 20th century 23 at this time about 25 of iceland was covered with forest compared to 1 in the present day 24 christianity was adopted by consensus around 999–1000 although norse paganism persisted among some segments of the population for some years afterwardscitation needed the middle agesedit the icelandic commonwealth lasted until the 13th century when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of icelandic chieftains 25 the internal struggles and civil strife of the age of the sturlungs led to the signing of the old covenant in 1262 which ended the commonwealth and brought iceland under the norwegian crown possession of iceland passed from the norwegian empire to the kalmar union in 1415 when the kingdoms of norway denmark and sweden were united after the break-up of the union in 1523 it remained a norwegian dependency as a part of denmarknorway in the ensuing centuries iceland became one of the poorest countries in europe infertile soil volcanic eruptions deforestation and an unforgiving climate made for harsh life in a society where subsistence depended almost entirely on agriculture the black death swept iceland twice first in 1402–1404 and again in 1494–1495 26 the former outbreak killed 50 to 60 of the population and the latter 30 to 50 27 reformation and the early modern periodedit around the middle of the 16th century as part of the protestant reformation king christian iii of denmark began to impose lutheranism on all his subjects jón arason the last catholic bishop of hólar was beheaded in 1550 along with two of his sons the country subsequently became officially lutheran and lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion in the 17th and 18th centuries denmark imposed harsh trade restrictions on iceland natural disasters including volcanic eruption and disease contributed to a decreasing population pirates from several countries including the barbary coast raided its coastal settlements and abducted people into slavery 28 29 a great smallpox epidemic in the 18th century killed around a third of the population 30 31 in 1783 the laki volcano erupted with devastating effects 32 in the years following the eruption known as the mist hardships icelandic móðuharðindin over half of all livestock died in the country around a quarter of the population died in the ensuing famine 33 independence movement 1814–1918edit in 1814 following the napoleonic wars denmark-norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the treaty of kiel but iceland remained a danish dependency throughout the 19th century the countrys climate continued to grow colder resulting in mass emigration to the new world particularly to the region of gimli manitoba in canada which was sometimes referred to as new iceland about 15,000 people emigrated out of a total population of 70,000 34 a national consciousness arose in the first half of the 19th century inspired by romantic and nationalist ideas from mainland europe an icelandic independence movement took shape in the 1850s under the leadership of jón sigurðsson based on the burgeoning icelandic nationalism inspired by the fjölnismenn and other danish-educated icelandic intellectuals in 1874 denmark granted iceland a constitution and limited home rule this was expanded in 1904 and hannes hafstein served as the first minister for iceland in the danish cabinet kingdom of iceland 1918–1944edit the danishicelandic act of union an agreement with denmark signed on 1 december 1918 and valid for 25years recognised iceland as a fully sovereign state in a personal union with denmark the government of iceland established an embassy in copenhagen and requested that denmark handle icelandic foreign policy danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags those of the kingdom of denmark and those of the kingdom of iceland during world war ii iceland joined denmark in asserting neutrality after the german occupation of denmark on 9 april 1940 the althing replaced the king with a regent and declared that the icelandic government would take control of foreign affairs and other matters previously handled by denmark a month later british armed forces invaded and occupied the country violating icelandic neutrality in 1941 the occupation was taken over by the united states so that britain could use its troops elsewhere independent republic 1944presentedit on 31 december 1943 the danishicelandic act of union expired after 25years beginning on 20 may 1944 icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with denmark abolish the monarchy and establish a republic the vote was 97 to end the union and 95 in favour of the new republican constitution 35 iceland formally became a republic on 17 june 1944 with sveinn björnsson as its first president in 1946 the allied occupation force left iceland the nation formally became a member of nato on 30 march 1949 amid domestic controversy and riots on 5 may 1951 a defence agreement was signed with the united states american troops returned to iceland as the iceland defence force and remained throughout the cold war the us withdrew the last of its forces on 30 september 2006 iceland had prospered during the war the immediate post-war period was followed by substantial economic growth driven by industrialisation of the fishing industry and the us marshall plan programme through which icelanders received the most aid per capita of any european country at usd 209 with the war-ravaged netherlands a distant second at usd 109 36 37 the 1970s were marked by the cod wars several disputes with the united kingdom over icelands extension of its fishing limits to 200miles offshore iceland hosted a summit in reykjavík in 1986 between united states president ronald reagan and soviet premier mikhail gorbachev during which they took significant steps toward nuclear disarmament a few years later iceland became the first country to recognize the independence of estonia latvia and lithuania as they broke away from the ussr throughout the 1990s the country expanded its international role and developed a foreign policy oriented toward humanitarian and peacekeeping causes to that end iceland provided aid and expertise to various nato-led interventions in bosnia kosovo and iraq 38 iceland joined the european economic area in 1994 after which the economy was greatly diversified and liberalised international economic relations increased further after 2001 when icelands newly deregulated banks began to raise massive amounts of external debt contributing to a 32 increase in icelands gross national income between 2002 and 2007 39 40 economic boom and crisisedit in the years 2003–2007 following the privatization of the banking sector under the government of davíð oddsson iceland moved toward having an economy based on international investment banking and financial services 41 it was quickly becoming one of the most prosperous countries in the world but was hit hard by a major financial crisis 41 the crisis resulted in the greatest migration from iceland since 1887 with a net emigration of 5,000 people in 2009 42 icelands economy stabilised under the government of jóhanna sigurðardóttir and grew by 1.6 in 2012 43 many icelanders however have remained unhappy with the state of the economy and government austerity policies the centre-right independence party was returned to power in coalition with the progressive party in the 2013 elections 44 geographyedit iceland is at the juncture of the north atlantic and arctic oceans the main island is entirely south of the arctic circle which passes through the small icelandic island of grímsey off the main islands northern coast the country lies between latitudes 63 and 68 n and longitudes 25 and 13 w iceland is closer to continental europe than to mainland north america thus the island is generally included in europe for historical political cultural and practical reasons geologically the island includes parts of both continental plates the closest body of land is greenland  290km 180mi the closest bodies of land in europe are the faroe islands  420km 260mi jan mayen island  570km 350mi shetland and the outer hebrides both about 740km  460mi and the scottish mainland and orkney both about 750km  470mi the mainland of norway is about 970km  600mi away iceland is the worlds 18th largest island and europes second largest island after great britain the main island is 101,826km2  39,315sqmi but the entire country is 103,000km2  39,768.5sqmi in size of which 62.7 is tundra there are thirty minor islands in iceland including the lightly populated grímsey and the vestmannaeyjar archipelago lakes and glaciers cover 14.3 of its surface only 23 is vegetated 45 the largest lakes are þórisvatn reservoir 83–88km2  32–34sqmi and þingvallavatn 82km2  32sqmi other important lakes include lagarfljót and mývatn jökulsárlón is the deepest lake at 248m  814ft 46 geologically iceland is part of the mid-atlantic ridge a ridge along which the oceanic crust spreads and forms new oceanic crust this part of the mid-ocean ridge is located above a mantle plume causing iceland to be subaerial above the surface of the sea the ridge marks the boundary between the eurasian and north american plates and iceland was created by rifting and accretion through volcanism along the ridge 47 many fjords punctuate icelands 4,970-kilometre  3,088-mile long coastline which is also where most settlements are situated the islands interior the highlands of iceland is a cold and uninhabitable combination of sand mountains and lava fields the major towns are the capital city of reykjavík along with its outlying towns of kópavogur hafnarfjörður and garðabær nearby reykjanesbær where the international airport is located and the town of akureyri in northern iceland the island of grímsey on the arctic circle contains the northernmost habitation of iceland whereas kolbeinsey contains the northernmost point of iceland 48 iceland has three national parks vatnajökull national park snæfellsjökull national park and þingvellir national park 49 the country is considered a strong performer in environmental protection having been ranked 13th in yale universitys environmental performance index of 2012 50 iceland as seen from space on 29 january 2004 suðureyri norðfjörður the eruption of eyjafjallajökull south of iceland off the ring road looking north late afternoon in winter 2001 iceland as seen from space on 29 january 2004 suðureyri norðfjörður the eruption of eyjafjallajökull south of iceland off the ring road looking north late afternoon in winter 2001 geologyedit a geologically young land iceland is located on both the iceland hotspot and the mid-atlantic ridge which runs right through it this location means that the island is highly geologically active with many volcanoes notably hekla eldgjá herðubreið and eldfell 51 the volcanic eruption of laki in 1783–1784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the islands population 52 in addition the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of europe and parts of asia and africa for several months afterward and affected climates in other areas 53 iceland has many geysers including geysir from which the english word is derived and the famous strokkur which erupts every 8–10minutes after a phase of inactivity geysir started erupting again after a series of earthquakes in 2000 geysir has since grown quieter and does not erupt often 54 with the widespread availability of geothermal power and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for hydroelectricity most residents have access to inexpensive hot water heating and electricity the island is composed primarily of basalt a low-silica lava associated with effusive volcanism as has occurred also in hawaii iceland however has a variety of volcanic types composite and fissure many producing more evolved lavas such as rhyolite and andesite iceland has hundreds of volcanoes with approx 30 volcanic systems active 55 surtsey one of the youngest islands in the world is part of iceland named after surtr it rose above the ocean in a series of volcanic eruptions between 8 november 1963 and 5 june 1968 48 only scientists researching the growth of new life are allowed to visit the island 56 on 21 march 2010 a volcano in eyjafjallajökull in the south of iceland erupted for the first time since 1821 forcing 600 people to flee their homes 57 additional eruptions on 14 april forced hundreds of people to abandon their homes 58 the resultant cloud of volcanic ash brought major disruption to air travel across europe 59 another large eruption occurred on 21 may 2011 this time it was the grímsvötn volcano located under the thick ice of europes largest glacier vatnajökull grímsvötn is one of icelands most active volcanoes and this eruption was much more powerful than the 2010 eyjafjallajökull activity with ash and lava 20km  12mi hurled into the atmosphere creating a large cloud 60 the highest elevation for iceland is listed as 2,110 metres  6,923ft at hvannadalshnúkur  64°00n 16°39w climateedit the climate of icelands coast is subpolar oceanic the warm north atlantic current ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world regions in the world with similar climates include the aleutian islands the alaska peninsula and tierra del fuego although these regions are closer to the equator despite its proximity to the arctic the islands coasts remain ice-free through the winter ice incursions are rare the last having occurred on the north coast in 1969 61 the climate varies between different parts of the island generally speaking the south coast is warmer wetter and windier than the north the central highlands are the coldest part of the country low-lying inland areas in the north are the most arid snowfall in winter is more common in the north than the south the highest air temperature recorded was 30.5c  86.9f on 22 june 1939 at teigarhorn on the southeastern coast the lowest was −38c −36.4f on 22 january 1918 at grímsstaðir and möðrudalur in the northeastern hinterland the temperature records for reykjavík are 26.2c  79.2f on 30 july 2008 and −24.5c −12.1f on 21 january 1918 biodiversityedit there are around 1,300 known species of insects in iceland which is low compared with other countries over one million species have been described worldwide the only native land mammal when humans arrived was the arctic fox 64 which came to the island at the end of the ice age walking over the frozen sea on rare occasions bats have been carried to the island with the winds but they are not able to breed there polar bears occasionally come over from greenland but they are just visitors and no icelandic populations exist 65 there are no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians on the island 66 phytogeographically iceland belongs to the arctic province of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom approximately three quarters of the island are barren of vegetation plant life consists mainly of grassland which is regularly grazed by livestock the most common tree native to iceland is the northern birch betula pubescens which formerly formed forests over much of iceland along with aspens populus tremula rowans sorbus aucuparia common junipers juniperus communis and other smaller trees mainly willows when the island was first settled it was extensively forested in the late 12th century ari the wise described it in the íslendingabók as forested from mountain to sea shore 67 permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin volcanic soils and limited species diversity the forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber 64 deforestation climatic deterioration during the little ice age and overgrazing by sheep imported by settlers caused a loss of critical topsoil due to erosion today many farms have been abandoned three quarters of icelands 100,000 square kilometres are affected by soil erosion 18,000km2  6,900sqmi serious enough to make the land useless 67 only a few small birch stands now exist in isolated reserves the planting of new forests has increased the number of trees but the result does not compare to the original forests some of the planted forests include introduced species 64 the tallest tree in iceland is a sitka spruce planted in 1949 in kirkjubæjarklaustur it was measured at 25.2 metres  83ft in 2013 68 the animals of iceland include the icelandic sheep cattle chickens goats the sturdy icelandic horse and the icelandic sheepdog all descendants of animals imported by europeans wild mammals include the arctic fox mink mice rats rabbits and reindeer polar bears occasionally visit the island travelling on icebergs from greenland in june 2008 two polar bears arrived in the same month 69 marine mammals include the grey seal halichoerus grypus and harbor seal phoca vitulina many species of fish live in the ocean waters surrounding iceland and the fishing industry is a major part of icelands economy accounting for approximately half of the countrys total exports birds especially seabirds are an important part of icelands animal life puffins skuas and kittiwakes nest on its sea cliffs 70 commercial whaling is practised intermittently 71 72 along with scientific whale hunts 73 whale watching has become an important part of icelands economy since 1997 74 politicsedit iceland has a leftright multi-party system following the 2013 parliamentary election the biggest parties are the centre-right independence party sjálfstæðisflokkurinn and the progressive party framsóknarflokkurinn other political parties with seats in the althing are the centre-left social democratic alliance samfylkingin left-green movement vinstrihreyfingin grænt framboð bright future björt framtíð and the pirate party of iceland píratar many other parties exist on the municipal level most of which run only locally in a single municipality iceland was the first country in the world to have a political party formed and led entirely by women 75 known as the womens list or womens alliance kvennalistinn it was founded in 1983 to advance the political economic and social needs of women after participating in its first parliamentary elections the womens list helped increase the proportion of female parliamentarians by 15 76 although it disbanded in 1999 merging with the social democratic alliance it left a lasting influence on icelands politics every major party has a 40 quota for women and in 2009 nearly a third of members of parliament were female compared to the global average of 16 77 in 2011 iceland was ranked 2nd in the strength of its democratic institutions 78 and 13th in government transparency 79 the country has a high level of civic participation with 81.4 voter turnout during the most recent elections 80 compared to an oecd average of 72 however only 50 of icelanders say they trust their political institutions slightly less than the oecd average of 56 and most probably a consequence of the political scandals in the wake of the icelandic financial crisis 81 governmentedit iceland is a representative democracy and a parliamentary republic the modern parliament alþingi english althing was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the danish monarch it was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the commonwealth period and suspended in 1799 consequently it is arguably the worlds oldest parliamentary democracy 82 it currently has 63 members elected for a maximum period of four years 83 the president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years with no term limit the elections for president the althing and local municipal councils are all held separately every four years 84 the president of iceland is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat but may veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum the current president is guðni th jóhannesson the head of government is the prime minister who together with the cabinet is responsible for executive government the cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the althing however the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how to distribute its seats under the condition that it has a majority support in the althing only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally this has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944 but in 1942 regent sveinn björnsson who had been installed in that position by the althing in 1941 appointed a non-parliamentary government the regent had for all practical purposes the position of a president and sveinn would later become the countrys first president in 1944 the governments of iceland have always been coalition governments with two or more parties involved as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the althing throughout the republican period the extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholarswhich in iceland several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers but other provisions and traditions suggest differentlycitation needed in 1980 icelanders elected vigdís finnbogadóttir as president the worlds first directly elected female head of state she retired from office in 1996 in 2009 iceland became the first country with an openly gay head of government when jóhanna sigurðardóttir became prime minister 85 administrative divisionsedit iceland is divided into regions constituencies and municipalities the eight regions are primarily used for statistical purposes district court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division 48 until 2003 the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions but by an amendment to the constitution they were changed to the current six constituencies reykjavík north and reykjavík south city regions southwest four non-contiguous suburban areas around reykjavík northwest and northeast northern half of iceland split and south southern half of iceland excluding reykjavík and suburbs the redistricting change was made to balance the weight of different districts of the country since previously a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the reykjavík city area the imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system but still exists 48 74 municipalities in iceland govern local matters like schools transport and zoning 86 these are the actual second-level subdivisions of iceland as the constituencies have no relevance except in elections and for statistical purposes reykjavík is by far the most populous municipality about four times more populous than kópavogur the second one 48 regions of iceland constituencies of iceland municipalities of iceland regions of iceland constituencies of iceland municipalities of iceland foreign relationsedit iceland which is a member of the un nato efta council of europe and oecd maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations but its ties with the nordic countries germany the united states canada and the other nato nations are particularly close historically due to cultural economic and linguistic similarities iceland is a nordic country and it participates in intergovernmental cooperation through the nordic council iceland is a member of the european economic area eea which allows the country access to the single market of the european union eu it was not a member of the eu but in july 2009 the icelandic parliament the althing voted in favour of application for eu membership 87 and officially applied on 17 july 2009 88 however in 2013 opinion polls showed that many icelanders were now against joining the eu following recent elections the two parties that formed the islands new government  the centrist progressive party and the right-wing independence party  announced they would hold a referendum on eu membership 89 militaryedit iceland has no standing army the us air force maintained four to six interceptor aircraft at the keflavík base until they were withdrawn on 30 september 2006 since may 2008 nato nations have periodically deployed fighters to patrol icelandic airspace under the icelandic air policing mission 90 91 iceland supported the 2003 invasion of iraq despite much domestic controversy deploying a coast guard eod team to iraq 92 which was replaced later by members of the iceland crisis response unit iceland has also participated in the ongoing conflict in afghanistan and the 1999 nato bombing of yugoslavia despite the ongoing financial crisis the first new patrol ship in decades was launched on 29 april 2009 93 icelanders remain especially proud of their role in hosting the historic 1986 reagangorbachev summit in reykjavík which set the stage for the end of the cold war icelands principal historical international disputes involved disagreements over fishing rights conflict with the united kingdom led to a series of so-called cod wars in 1952–1956 due to the extension of icelands fishing zone from 3 to 4nmi  5.6 to 7.4km 3.5 to 4.6mi 1958–1961 following a further extension to 12nmi  22.2km 13.8mi 1972–1973 with another extension to 50nmi  92.6km 57.5mi and in 1975–1976 another extension to 200nmi  370.4km 230.2mi according to the global peace index iceland is the most peaceful country in the world due to its lack of armed forces low crime rate and high level of socio-political stability 94 economyedit in 2007 iceland was the seventh most productive country in the world per capita us$54,858 and the fifth most productive by gdp at purchasing power parity $40,112 about 85 percent of total primary energy supply in iceland is derived from domestically produced renewable energy sources 95 utilization of abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power has made iceland the worlds largest electricity producer per capita 96 as a result of its commitment to renewable energy the 2016 global green economy index ranked iceland among the top 10 greenest economies in the world 97 historically icelands economy depended heavily on fishing which still provides 40 of export earnings and employs 7 of the work force 48 the economy is vulnerable to declining fish stocks and drops in world prices for its main material exports fish and fish products aluminium and ferrosilicon whaling in iceland has been historically significant iceland still relies heavily on fishing but its importance is diminishing from an export share of 90 in the 1960s to 40 in 2006 98 until the 20th century iceland was among the poorest countries in europe currently it remains one of the most developed countries in the world strong economic growth had led iceland to be ranked first

about the possibility of constructing a high-voltage direct-current connector for transmission of electricity between the two countries 145 such a cable would give iceland access to a market where electricity prices have generally been much higher than those in iceland 146 iceland has considerable renewable energy resources especially geothermal energy and hydropower resources 147 and most of the potential has not been developed partly because there is not enough demand for additional electricity generation capacity from the residents and industry of iceland but the united kingdom is interested in importing inexpensive electricity from renewable sources of energy and this could lead to further development of the energy resources education and scienceedit the ministry of education science and culture is responsible for the policies and methods that schools must use and they issue the national curriculum guidelines however playschools primary schools and lower secondary schools are funded and administered by the municipalities the government does allow citizens to home educate their children however under a very strict set of demands 148 students must adhere closely to the government mandated curriculum and the parent teaching must acquire a government approved teaching certificate nursery school or leikskóli is non-compulsory education for children younger than six years and is the first step in the education system the current legislation concerning playschools was passed in 1994 they are also responsible for ensuring that the curriculum is suitable so as to make the transition into compulsory education as easy as possible compulsory education or grunnskóli comprises primary and lower secondary education which often is conducted at the same institution education is mandatory by law for children aged from 6 to 16years the school year lasts nine months beginning between 21 august and 1 september ending between 31 may and 10 june the minimum number of

were particularly proficient in reading and mathematics according to a 2013 eurostat report by the european commission iceland spends around 3.11 of its gdp on scientific research and development rd over 1 percentage point higher than the eu average of 2.03 and has set a target of 4 to reach by 2020 151 a 2010 unesco report found that out of 72 countries that spend the most on rd  100million us dollars or more iceland ranked 9th by proportion of gdp tied with taiwan switzerland and germany and ahead of france the uk and canada 152 demographicsedit the original population of iceland was of nordic and gaelic origin this is evident from literary evidence dating from the settlement period as well as from later scientific studies such as blood type and genetic analyses one such genetics study has indicated that the majority of the male settlers were of nordic origin while the majority of the women were of gaelic origin meaning many settlers of iceland were indeed norwegian viking warriors who brought gaelic slaves with them 153 iceland has extensive genealogical records dating back to the late 17th century and fragmentary records extending back to the age of settlement the biopharmaceutical company decode genetics has funded the creation of a genealogy database that is intended to cover all of icelands known inhabitants it views the database called íslendingabók as a valuable tool for conducting research on genetic diseases given the relative isolation of icelands population the population of the island is believed to have varied from 40,000 to 60,000 in the period ranging from initial settlement until the mid-19th century during that time cold winters ash fall from volcanic eruptions and bubonic plagues adversely affected the population several times 8 there were 37 famine years in iceland between 1500 and 1804 154 the first census was carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population was then 50,358 after the destructive volcanic eruptions of the laki volcano during 1783–1784 the population reached a low of about 40,000 155 improving living conditions have triggered a rapid increase in population since the mid-19th centuryfrom about 60,000 in 1850 to 320,000 in 2008 iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country with one out of five people being 14years old or younger with a fertility rate of 2.1 iceland is one of only a few european countries with a birth rate sufficient for long-term population growth see table on the left 156 157 in december 2007 33,678 people  13.5 of the total population living in iceland had been born abroad including children of icelandic parents living abroad around 19,000 people  6 of the population held foreign citizenship polish people make up the largest minority group by a considerable margin and still form the bulk of the foreign workforce about 8,000 poles now live in iceland 1,500 of them in fjarðabyggð where they make up 75 of the workforce who are constructing the fjarðarál aluminium plant 159 the recent increase in immigration has been creditedby whom to a labour shortage due to the booming economy at the time as well as to the lifting of restrictions on the movement of people from the countries that were a part of the 2004 enlargement of the european unioncitation needed large-scale construction projects in the east of iceland see kárahnjúkar hydropower plant have also brought in many people whose stay is expected to be temporary many polish immigrants were also considering leaving in 2008 as a result of the icelandic financial crisis 160 the southwest corner of iceland is the most densely populated region it is also the location of the capital reykjavík the northernmost national capital in the world the largest towns outside the greater reykjavík area are akureyri and reykjanesbær although the latter is relatively close to the capital some 500 icelanders under the leadership of erik the red colonised greenland among the existing paleo-eskimo inhabitants in the late 10th century 161 the total population reached a high point of perhaps 5,000 and developed independent institutions before disappearing by 1500 162 people from greenland attempted to set up a colony at vinland in north america but it was abandoned in the face of hostility from the indigenous residents 163 emigration to the united states and canada began in the 1870s as of 2006update canada had over 88,000 people of icelandic descent 164 while there are more than 40,000 americans of icelandic descent according to the 2000 us census 165 urbanisationedit icelands 10 most populous urban areas v t e languageedit icelands official written and spoken language is icelandic a north germanic language descended from old norse in grammar and vocabulary it has changed less from old norse than the other nordic languages icelandic has preserved more verb and noun inflection and has to a considerable extent developed new vocabulary based on native roots rather than borrowings from other languages the puristic tendency in the development of icelandic vocabulary is to a large degree a result of conscious language planning in addition to centuries of isolation icelandic is the only living language to retain the use of the runic letter þ in latin script the closest living relative of the icelandic language is faroese icelandic sign language was officially recognised as a minority language in 2011 in education its use for icelands deaf community is regulated by the national curriculum guide english and danish are compulsory subjects in the school curriculum both languages are widely understood and spoken 166 other commonly spoken languages are swedish norwegian german and french polish is mostly spoken by the local polish community the biggest minority of iceland and danish is mostly spoken in a way largely comprehensible to swedes and norwegiansit is often referred to as skandinavíska i e scandinavian in iceland 167 rather than using family names as is the usual custom in most western nations icelanders carry patronymic or matronymic surnames patronyms being far more commonly practiced patronymic last names are based on the first name of the father while matronymic names are based on the first name of the mother these follow the persons given name eg elísabet jónsdóttir elísabet jóns daughter jón being the father or ólafur katrínarson ólafur katríns son katrín being the mother 168 consequently icelanders refer to one another by their given name and the icelandic telephone directory is listed alphabetically by first name rather than by surname 169 all new names must be decided upon by the icelandic naming committee healthedit iceland has a universal health care system that is administered by its ministry of welfare icelandic velferðarráðuneytið 170 and paid for mostly by taxes  85 and to a lesser extent by service fees  15 unlike most countries there are no private hospitals and private insurance is practically nonexistent 171 a considerable portion of the government budget is assigned to health care 171 and iceland ranks 11th in health care expenditures as a percentage of gdp 172 and 14th in spending per capita 173 over all the countrys health care system is one of the best performing in the world ranked 15th by the world health organization 174 according to an oecd report iceland devotes far more resources to healthcare than most industrialised nations as of 2009update iceland had 3.7 doctors per 1,000 people compared with an average of 3.1 in oecd countries and 15.3 nurses per 1,000 people compared with an oecd average of 8.4 175 icelanders are among the worlds healthiest people with 81 reporting they are in good health according to an oecd survey 81 although it is a growing problem obesity is not as prevalent as in other developed countries 175 iceland has many campaigns for health and wellbeing most famously the television show lazytown starring and created by former gymnastics champion magnus scheving infant mortality is one of the lowest in the world 176 and the proportion of the population that smokes is lower than the oecd average 175 almost all women choose to terminate pregnancies of children with down syndrome in iceland  177 the average life expectancy is 81.8 compared to an oecd average of 79.5 the 4th highest in the world 178 additionally iceland has a very low level of pollution thanks to an overwhelming reliance on cleaner geothermal energy a low population density and a high level of environmental consciousness among citizens 179 according to an oecd assessment the amount of toxic material in the atmosphere is far lower than any other industrialised country measured 180 religionedit icelanders have freedom of religion guaranteed under the constitution of iceland although the church of iceland a lutheran body is the state church the evangelical lutheran church shall be the state church in iceland and as such it shall be supported and protected by the state the registers iceland keeps account of the religious affiliation of every icelandic citizen in 2015 icelanders were divided into religious groups as follows 71.6 members of the church of iceland 11.6 members of some other christian denomination 9.0 other and not specified 5.8 unaffiliated 1.7 members of non-christian denomination 0.4 members of the icelandic ethical humanist association iceland is a very secular country as with other nordic nations religious attendance is relatively low 183 184 the above statistics represent administrative membership of religious organisations which does not necessarily reflect the belief demographics of the population of iceland according to a study published in 2001 23 of the inhabitants were either atheist or agnostic 185 a gallup poll conducted in 2012 found that 57 of icelanders considered themselves a religious person 31 considered themselves a non religious person while 10 defined themselves as a convinced atheist placing iceland among the ten countries with the highest proportions of atheists in the world 186 cultureedit icelandic culture has its roots in north germanic traditions icelandic literature is popular in particular the sagas and eddas that were written during the high and late middle ages centuries of isolation have helped to insulate the countrys nordic culture from external influence a prominent example is the preservation of the icelandic language which remains the closest to old norse of all modern nordic languagescitation needed in contrast to other nordic countries icelanders place relatively great importance on independence and self-sufficiency in a public opinion analysis conducted by the european commission over 85 of icelanders believe independence is very important compared to 47 of norwegians 49 of danes and an average of 53 for the eu25 187 icelanders also have a very strong work ethic working some of the longest hours of any industrialised nation 188 according to a poll conducted by the oecd 66 of icelanders were satisfied with their lives while 70 believed that their lives will be satisfying in the future similarly 83 of people in iceland reported having more positive experiences in an average day than negative ones compared to an oecd average of 72 which makes iceland one of the happiest countries in the oecd 81 a more recent 2012 survey found that around three quarters of respondents stated they were satisfied with their lives compared to a global average of about 53 189 iceland is liberal with regard to lgbt rights issues in 1996 the icelandic parliament passed legislation to create registered partnerships for same-sex couples conferring nearly all the rights and benefits of marriage in 2006 parliament voted unanimously to grant same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples in adoption parenting and assisted insemination treatment on 11 june 2010 the icelandic parliament amended the marriage law making it gender neutral and defining marriage as between two individuals making iceland one of the first countries in the world to legalise same-sex marriage the law took effect on 27 june 2010 190 the amendment to the law also means registered partnerships for same-sex couples are now no longer possible and marriage is their only optionidentical to the existing situation for opposite-sex couples 190 icelanders are known for their deep sense of community an oecd survey found that 98 believe they know someone they could rely on in a time of need higher than in any other industrialised country similarly only 6 reported rarely or never socializing with others 81 this high level of social cohesion is attributed to the small size and homogeneity of the population as well as to a long history of harsh survival in an isolated environment which reinforced the importance of unity and cooperation 191 egalitarianism is highly valued among the people of iceland with income inequality being among the lowest in the world 100 the constitution explicitly prohibits the enactment of noble privileges titles and ranks 192 everyone is addressed by their first name as in other nordic countries equality between the sexes is very high iceland is consistently ranked among the top three countries in the world for women to live in 193 194 195 literatureedit icelands best-known classical works of literature are the icelanders sagas prose epics set in icelands age of settlement the most famous of these include njáls saga about an epic blood feud and grænlendinga saga and eiríks saga describing the discovery and settlement of greenland and vinland modern newfoundland egils saga laxdæla saga grettis saga gísla saga and gunnlaugs saga ormstungu are also notable and popular icelanders sagas a translation of the bible was published in the 16th century important compositions since the 15th to the 19th century include sacred verse most famously the passion hymns of hallgrímur pétursson and rímur rhyming epic poems originating in the 14th century rímur were popular into the 19th century when the development of new literary forms was provoked by the influential national-romantic writer jónas hallgrímsson in recent times iceland has produced many great writers the best-known of whom is arguably halldór laxness who received the nobel prize in literature in 1955 the only icelander to win a nobel prize thus far steinn steinarr was an influential modernist poet during the early 20th century who remains popular icelanders are avid consumers of literature with the highest number of bookstores per capita in the world for its size iceland imports and translates more international literature than any other nation 192 iceland also has the highest per capita publication of books and magazines 196 and around 10 of the population will publish a book in their lifetimes 197 artedit the distinctive rendition of the icelandic landscape by its painters can be linked to nationalism and the movement for home rule and independence which was very active in the mid-19th century contemporary icelandic painting is typically traced to the work of þórarinn þorláksson who following formal training in art in the 1890s in copenhagen returned to iceland to paint and exhibit works from 1900 to his death in 1924 almost exclusively portraying the icelandic landscape several other icelandic men and women artists studied at royal danish academy of fine arts at that time including ásgrímur jónsson who together with þórarinn created a distinctive portrayal of icelands landscape in a romantic naturalistic style other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of þórarinn and ásgrímur these included jóhannes kjarval and júlíana sveinsdóttir kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic volcanic rock that dominates the icelandic environment einar hákonarson is an expressionistic and figurative painter who by some is considered to have brought the figure back into icelandic painting in the 1980s many icelandic artists worked with the subject of the new painting in their work in the recent years artistic practice has multiplied and the icelandic art scene has become a setting for many large scale projects and exhibitions the artist run gallery space kling og bang members of which later ran the studio complex and exhibition venue klink og bank has been a significant part of the trend of self-organised spaces exhibitions and projects 198 the living

post-rock band sigur rós the national anthem of iceland is lofsöngur written by matthías jochumsson with music by sveinbjörn sveinbjörnsson 199 traditional icelandic music is strongly religious hymns both religious and secular are a particularly well-developed form of music due to the scarcity of musical instruments throughout much of icelands history hallgrímur pétursson wrote many protestant hymns in the 17th century icelandic music was modernised in the 19th century when magnús stephensen brought pipe organs which were followed by harmoniums other vital traditions of icelandic music are epic alliterative and rhyming ballads called rímur rímur are epic tales usually a cappella which can be traced back to skaldic poetry using complex metaphors and elaborate rhyme schemes 200 the best known rímur poet of the 19th century was sigurður breiðfjörð  1798–1846 a modern revitalisation of the tradition began in 1929 with the formation of iðunnclarification needed icelandic contemporary
