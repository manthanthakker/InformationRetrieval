massachusetts institute of technology the massachusetts institute of technology mit is a private research university in cambridge massachusetts founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the united states mit adopted a european polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering researchers worked on computers radar and inertial guidance during world war ii and the cold war post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under james killian the current 168-acre  68.0ha campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile  1.6km along the northern bank of the charles river basin the institute is traditionally known for its research and education in the physical sciences and engineering and more recently in biology economics linguistics and management as well it is often cited as among the worlds top universities 10 11 12 13 the engineers sponsor 31 sports most teams of

historyedit foundation and visionedit in 1859 a proposal was submitted to the massachusetts general court to use newly filled lands in back bay boston for a conservatory of art and science but the proposal failed 17 18 a charter for the incorporation of the massachusetts institute of technology proposed by william barton rogers was signed by the governor of massachusetts on april 10 1861 19 rogers a professor from the university of virginia wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances 20 21 he did not wish to found a professional school but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education 22 proposing that the true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is as i conceive the teaching not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts which can be done only in the workshop but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them and along with this a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws 23 the rogers plan reflected the german research university model emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories 24 25 early developmentsedit two days after the charter was issued the first battle of the civil war broke out after a long delay through the war years mits first classes were held in the mercantile building in boston in 1865 26 the new institute was founded as part of the morrill land-grant colleges act to fund institutions to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes and was a land-grant school 27 28 in 1863 under the same act the commonwealth of massachusetts founded the massachusetts agricultural college which developed as the university of massachusetts amherst in 1866 the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the back bay 29 mit was informally called boston tech 29 the institute adopted the european polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date 30 despite chronic financial problems the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under president francis amasa walker 31 programs in electrical chemical marine and sanitary engineering were introduced 32 33 new buildings were built and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand 31 the curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis with less focus on theoretical science 34 the fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the mit leadership during these boston tech years mit faculty and alumni rebuffed harvard university president and former mit faculty charles w eliots repeated attempts to merge mit with harvard colleges lawrence scientific school 35 there would be at least six attempts to absorb mit into harvard 36 in its cramped back bay location mit could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding eventually the mit corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with harvard over the vehement objections of mit faculty students and alumni 36 however a 1917 decision by the massachusetts supreme judicial court effectively put an end to the merger scheme 36 in 1916 the mit administration and the mit charter crossed the charles river on the ceremonial barge bucentaur built for the occasion 37 38 to signify mits move to a spacious new campus largely consisting of filled land on a mile-long tract along the cambridge side of the charles river 39 40 the neoclassical new technology campus was designed by william w bosworth 41 and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious mr smith starting in 1912 in january 1920 the donor was revealed to be the industrialist george eastman of rochester new york who had invented methods of film production and processing and founded eastman kodak between 1912 and 1920 eastman donated $20 million $236.6 million in 2015 dollars in cash and kodak stock to mit 42 curricular reformsedit in the 1930s president karl taylor compton and vice-president effectively provost vannevar bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios 43 the compton reforms renewed confidence in the ability of the institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering 44 unlike ivy league schools mit catered more to middle-class families and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants for its funding 45 the school was elected to the association of american universities in 1934 46 still as late as 1949 the lewis committee lamented in its report on the state of education at mit that the institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school a partly unjustified perception the committee sought to change the report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum recommended offering a broader education and warned against letting engineering and government-sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities 47 48 the school of humanities arts and social sciences and the mit sloan school of management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful schools of science and engineering previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics management political science and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs 49 50 the school of humanities arts and social sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents howard w johnson and jerome wiesner between 1966 and 1980 51 defense researchedit mits involvement in military research surged during world war ii in 1941 vannevar bush was appointed head of the federal office of scientific research and development and directed funding to only a select group of universities including mit 52 engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at mits radiation laboratory established in 1940 to assist the british military in developing microwave radar the work done there significantly affected both the war and subsequent research in the area 53 other defense projects included gyroscope-based and other complex control systems for gunsight bombsight and inertial navigation under charles stark drapers instrumentation laboratory 54 55 the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under project whirlwind 56 and high-speed and high-altitude photography under harold edgerton 57 58 by the end of the war mit became the nations largest wartime rd contractor attracting some criticism of bush 52 employing nearly 4000 in the radiation laboratory alone 53 and receiving in excess of $100 million $1.2 billion in 2015 dollars before 1946 44 work on defense projects continued even after then post-war government-sponsored research at mit included sage and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and project apollo 59 these activities affected mit profoundly a 1949 report noted the lack of any great slackening in the pace of life at the institute to match the return to peacetime remembering the academic tranquility of the prewar years though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities 61 the faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of karl taylor compton president of mit between 1930 and 1948 james rhyne killian president from 1948 to 1957 and julius adams stratton chancellor from 1952 to 1957 whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university by the 1950s mit no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons philanthropic foundations and the federal government 62 in late 1960s and early 1970s student and faculty activists protested against the vietnam war and mits defense research 63 64 in this period mits various departments were researching helicopters smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles 65 the union of concerned scientists was founded on march 4 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems 66 mit ultimately divested itself from the instrumentation laboratory and moved all classified research off-campus to the lincoln laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests 67 68 the student body faculty and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities 63 johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to greater strength and unity after these times of turmoil 69 however six mit students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders such as michael albert and george katsiaficas are still indignant about mits role in military research and its suppression of these protests 70 richard leacocks film november actions records some of these tumultuous events 71 recent historyedit mit has kept pace with and helped to advance the digital age in addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies 72 73 students staff and faculty members at project mac the artificial intelligence laboratory and the tech model railroad club wrote some of the earliest interactive computer video games like spacewar and created much of modern hacker slang and culture 74 several major computer-related organizations have originated at mit since the 1980s richard stallmans gnu project and the subsequent free software foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the ai lab the mit media lab was founded in 1985 by nicholas negroponte and jerome wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology 75 the world wide web consortium standards organization was founded at the laboratory for computer science in 1994 by tim berners-lee 76 the opencourseware project has made course materials for over 2,000 mit classes available online free of charge since 2002 77 and the one laptop per child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005 78 mit was named a sea-grant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a space-grant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs 79 80 despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century mit launched several successful development campaigns to significantly expand the campus new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus the tang center for management education several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology brain and cognitive sciences genomics biotechnology and cancer research and a number of new backlot buildings on vassar street including the stata center 81 construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the media lab the sloan schools eastern campus and graduate residences in the northwest 82 83 in 2006 president hockfield launched the mit energy research council to investigate the interdisciplinary challenges posed by increasing global energy consumption 84 in 2001 inspired by the open source and open access movements 85 mit launched opencourseware to make the lecture notes problem sets syllabuses exams and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed 86 while the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high 87 ocw expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the opencourseware consortium which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages 88 in 2011 mit announced it would offer formal certification but not credits or degrees to online participants completing coursework in its mitx program for a modest fee 89 the edx online platform supporting mitx was initially developed in partnership with harvard and its analogous harvardx initiative the courseware platform is open source and other universities have already joined and added their own course content 90 three days after the boston marathon bombing of april 2013 mit police patrol officer sean collier was fatally shot by the suspects dzhokhar and tamerlan tsarnaev setting off a violent manhunt that shut down the campus and much of the boston metropolitan area for a day 91 one week later colliers memorial service was attended by more than 10,000 people in a ceremony hosted by the mit community with thousands of police officers from the new england region and canada 92 93 94 on november 25 2013 mit announced the creation of the collier medal to be awarded annually to an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that officer collier exhibited as a member of the mit community and in all aspects of his life the announcement further stated that future recipients of the award will include those whose contributions exceed the boundaries of their profession those who have contributed to building bridges across the community and those who consistently and selflessly perform acts of kindness 95 96 97 campusedit mits 168-acre  68.0ha campus in the city of cambridge spans approximately a mile along the north side of the charles river basin 6 the campus is divided roughly in half by massachusetts avenue with most dormitories and student life facilities to the west and most academic buildings to the east the bridge closest to mit is the harvard bridge which is known for being marked off in a non-standard unit of length  the smoot 98 99 the kendall mbta red line station is located on the northeastern edge of the campus in kendall square the cambridge neighborhoods surrounding mit are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings as well as socio-economically diverse residential neighborhoods 100 101 in early 2016 mit presented its updated kendall square initiative to the city of cambridge with plans for mixed-use educational retail residential startup incubator and office space in a dense high-rise transit-oriented development plan 102 103 the mit museum will eventually be moved immediately adjacent to a kendall square subway entrance joining the list visual arts center on the eastern end of the campus 103 104 each building at mit has a number possibly preceded by a w n e or nw designation and most have a name as well typically academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name the organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which the buildings were built and their location relative north west and east to the original center cluster of maclaurin buildings 105 many of the buildings are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of underground tunnels providing protection from the cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking 106 107 mits on-campus nuclear reactor 108 is one of the most powerful university-based nuclear reactors in the united states the prominence of the reactors containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial 109 but mit maintains that it is well-secured 110 in 1999 bill gates donated us$20 million to mit for the construction of a computer laboratory named the william h gates building and designed by architect frank o gehry while microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution this was the first personal donation received from gates 111 other notable campus facilities include a pressurized wind tunnel and a towing tank for testing ship and ocean structure designs 112 113 mits campus-wide wireless network was completed in the fall of 2005 and consists of nearly 3,000 access points covering 9,400,000 square feet  870,000m2 of campus 114 in 2001 the environmental protection agency sued mit for violating the clean water act and the clean air act with regard to its hazardous waste storage and disposal procedures 115 mit settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects 116 in connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus the institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency mit has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles subsidizing public transportation passes and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity heating and cooling requirements 117 the mit police with state and local authorities in the 2009-2011 period have investigated reports of 12 forcible sex offenses 6 robberies 3 aggravated assaults 164 burglaries 1 case of arson and 4 cases of motor vehicle theft on campus affecting a community of around 22,000 students and employees 118 mit also has substantial commercial real estate holdings in cambridge on which it pays property taxes this includes technology square parts of kendall square and many properties in cambridgeport and area 4 neighboring the educational buildings 119 the land is held for investment purposes and potential long-term expansion architectureedit mits school of architecture now the school of architecture and planning was the first in the united states 120 and it has a history of commissioning progressive buildings 121 122 the first buildings constructed on the cambridge campus completed in 1916 are sometimes called the maclaurin buildings after institute president richard maclaurin who oversaw their construction designed by william welles bosworth these imposing buildings were built of reinforced concrete a first for a non-industrial  much less university  building in the us 123 bosworths design was influenced by the city beautiful movement of the early 1900s 123 and features the pantheon-esque great dome housing the barker engineering library the great dome overlooks killian court where graduation ceremonies are held each year the friezes of the limestone-clad buildings around killian court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophersa the spacious building 7 atrium at 77 massachusetts avenue is regarded as the entrance to the infinite corridor and the rest of the campus 101 alvar aaltos baker house  1947 eero saarinens mit chapel and kresge auditorium  1955 and im peis green dreyfus landau and wiesner buildings represent high forms of post-war modernist architecture 126 127 128 more recent buildings like frank gehrys stata center  2004 steven holls simmons hall  2002 charles correas building 46  2005 and fumihiko makis media lab extension  2009 stand out among the boston areas classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus starchitecture 121 129 these buildings have not always been well received 130 131 in 2010 the princeton review included mit in a list of twenty schools whose campuses are tiny unsightly or both 132 housingedit undergraduates are guaranteed four-year housing in one of mits 12 undergraduate dormitories 133 those living on campus can receive support and mentoring from live-in graduate student tutors resident advisors and faculty housemasters 134 because housing assignments are made based on the preferences of the students themselves diverse social atmospheres can be sustained in different living groups for example according to the yale daily news staffs the insiders guide to the colleges 2010 the split between east campus and west campus is a significant characteristic of mit east campus has gained a reputation as a thriving counterculture 135 mit also has 5 dormitories for single graduate students and 2 apartment buildings on campus for married student families 136 mit has an active greek and co-op housing system including thirty-six fraternities sororities and independent living groups fsilgs 137 as of 2015update 98 of all undergraduates lived in mit-affiliated housing 54 of the men participated in fraternities and 20 of the women were involved in sororities 138 most fsilgs are located across the river in back bay near where mit was founded and there is also a cluster of fraternities on mits west campus that face the charles river basin 139 after the 1997 alcohol-related death of scott krueger a new pledge at the phi gamma delta fraternity mit required all freshmen to live in the dormitory system starting in 2002 140 because fsilgs had previously housed as many as 300 freshmen off-campus the new policy could not be implemented until simmons hall opened in that year 141 organization and administrationedit mit is chartered as a non-profit organization and is owned and governed by a privately appointed board of trustees known as the mit corporation 142 the current board consists of 43 members elected to five-year terms 143 25 life members who vote until their 75th birthday 144 3 elected officers president treasurer and secretary 145 and 4 ex officio members the president of the alumni association the governor of massachusetts the massachusetts secretary of education and the chief justice of the massachusetts supreme judicial court 146 147 the board is chaired by robert millard a co-founder of l-3 communications holdings 148 149 the corporation approves the budget new programs degrees and faculty appointments and elects the president to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and preside over the institutes faculty 101 150 mits endowment and other financial assets are managed through a subsidiary called mit investment management company mitimco 151 valued at $13.475 billion in 2015 mits endowment is the sixth-largest among american colleges and universities 3 mit has five schools science engineering architecture and planning management and humanities arts and social sciences and one college whitaker college of health sciences and technology but no schools of law or medicine 152b while faculty committees assert substantial control over many areas of mits curriculum research student life and administrative affairs 154 the chair of each of mits 32 academic departments reports to the dean of that departments school who in turn reports to the provost under the president 155 the current president is l rafael reif who formerly served as provost under president susan hockfield the first woman to hold the post 156 157 academicsedit mit is a large highly residential research university with a majority of enrollments in graduate and professional programs 158 the university has been accredited by the new england association of schools and colleges since 1929 159 160 mit operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall semester beginning after labor day and ending in mid-december a 4-week independent activities period in the month of january and the spring semester beginning in early february and ending in late may 161 mit students refer to both their majors and classes using numbers or acronyms alone 162 departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order of their foundation for example civil and environmental engineering is course 1 while linguistics and philosophy is course 24 163 students majoring in electrical engineering and computer science eecs the most popular department collectively identify themselves as course 6 mit students use a combination of the departments course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects the introductory calculus-based classical mechanics course is simply "8.01 at mit 164c undergraduate programedit the four-year full-time undergraduate program maintains a balance between professional majors and those in the arts and sciences and has been dubbed most selective by us news 167 admitting few transfer students 158 and 8.0 of its applicants in the 2015 admissions cycle 168 mit offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools 169 in the 2010–2011 academic year 1,161 bachelor of science degrees abbreviated sb were granted the only type of undergraduate degree mit now awardsneeds update 170 171 in the 2011 fall term among students who had designated a major the school of engineering was the most popular division enrolling 63 of students in its 19 degree programs followed by the school of science  29 school of humanities arts  social sciences  3.7 sloan school of management  3.3 and school of architecture and planning  2needs update the largest undergraduate degree programs were in electrical engineering and computer science course 6–2 computer science and engineering course 6–3 mechanical engineering course 2 physics course 8 and mathematics course 18 165 all undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the general institute requirements girs 172 the science requirement generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors comprises two semesters of physics two semesters of calculus one semester of chemistry and one semester of biology there is a laboratory requirement usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major the humanities arts and social sciences hass requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities arts and social sciences including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a hass division under the communication requirement two of the hass classes plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be communication-intensive 173 including substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation 174 finally all students are required to complete a swimming test 175 non-varsity athletes must also take four quarters of physical education classes 172 most classes rely on a combination of lectures recitations led by associate professors or graduate students weekly problem sets p-sets and periodic quizzes or tests while the pace and difficulty of mit coursework has been compared to drinking from a fire hose 176 177 the freshmen retention rate at mit is similar to other research universities 167 the passno-record grading system relieves some pressure for first-year undergraduates for each class taken in the fall term freshmen transcripts will either report only that the class was passed or otherwise not have any record of it in the spring term passing grades a b c appear on the transcript while non-passing grades are again not recorded 178 grading had previously been passno record all freshman year but was amended for the class of 2006 to prevent students from gaming the system by completing required major classes in their freshman year 179 also freshmen may choose to join alternative learning communities such as experimental study group concourse or terrascope 178 in 1969 margaret macvicar founded the undergraduate research opportunities program urop to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers students join or initiate research projects urops for academic credit pay or on a volunteer basis through postings on the urop website or by contacting faculty members directly 180 a substantial majority of undergraduates participate 181 182 students often become published file patent applications andor launch start-up companies based upon their experience in urops 183 184 in 1970 the then-dean of institute relations benson r snyder published the hidden curriculum arguing that education at mit was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education the successful student according to snyder was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms for example organized student groups had compiled course biblescollections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references this sort of gamesmanship snyder argued hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest 185 186 graduate programedit mits graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels mit offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities social sciences and stem fields as well as professional degrees 158 the institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the master of science ms various engineers degrees doctor of philosophy phd and doctor of science scd and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as the md-phd with harvard medical school 187 188 admission to graduate programs is decentralized applicants apply directly to the department or degree program more than 90 of doctoral students are supported by fellowships research assistantships ras or teaching assistantships tas 189 mit awarded 1,547 masters degrees and 609 doctoral degrees in the academic year 2010–11needs update 170 in the

preferences 198 199 200 for several years us news  world report the qs world university rankings and the academic ranking of world universities have ranked mits school of engineering first as did the 1995 national research council report 201 in the same lists mits strongest showings apart from in engineering are in computer science the natural sciences business economics linguistics mathematics and to a lesser extent political science and philosophy 10 11 12 13 202 in 2014 money magazine ranked mit as third in the us best colleges for your money based on its assessment of the most bang for your tuition buck factoring in quality of education affordability and career outcomes 203 as of 2014update forbes magazine rated mit as the second most entrepreneurial university based on the percentage of alumni and students self-identifying as founders or business owners on linkedin 204 in 2015 brookings fellow jonathan rothwell issued a report beyond college rankings placing mit as third in the us with an estimated 45 value-added to mid-career salary 205 collaborationsedit the university historically pioneered research and training collaborations between academia industry and government 206 207 in 1946 president compton harvard business school professor georges doriot and massachusetts investor trust chairman merrill grisswold founded american research and development corporation the first american venture-capital firm 208 209 in 1948 compton established the mit industrial liaison program 210 throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s american politicians and business leaders accused mit and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international  especially japanese  firms that were competing with struggling american businesses 211 212 on the other hand mits extensive collaboration with the federal government on research projects has led to several mit leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940e mit established a washington office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy 214 215 the us justice department began an investigation in 1989 and in 1991 filed an antitrust suit against mit the eight ivy league colleges and eleven other institutions for allegedly engaging in price-fixing during their annual overlap meetings which were held to prevent bidding wars over promising prospective students from consuming funds for need-based scholarships 216 217 while the ivy league institutions settled 218 mit contested the charges arguing that the practice was not anti-competitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students 219 220 mit ultimately prevailed when the justice department dropped the case in 1994 221 222 mits proximityf to harvard university the other school up the river has led to a substantial number of research collaborations such as the harvard-mit division of health sciences and technology and the broad institute 223 in addition students at the two schools can cross-register for credits toward their own schools degrees without any additional fees 223 a cross-registration program between mit and wellesley college has also existed since 1969 and in 2002 the cambridgemit institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between mit and the university of cambridge 223 mit has more modest cross-registration programs with boston university brandeis university tufts university massachusetts college of art and the school of the museum of fine arts boston 223 mit maintains substantial research and faculty ties with independent research organizations in the boston area such as the charles stark draper laboratory the whitehead institute for biomedical research and the woods hole oceanographic institution ongoing international research and educational collaborations include the singapore-mit alliance mit-politecnico di milano 223 224 mit-zaragoza international logistics program and projects in other countries through the mit international science and technology initiatives misti program 223 225 the mass-market magazine technology review is published by mit through a subsidiary company as is a special edition that also serves as an alumni magazine 226 227 the mit press is a major university press publishing over 200 books and 30 journals annually emphasizing science and technology as well as arts architecture new media current events and social issues 228 libraries collections and museumsedit the mit library system consists of five subject libraries barker engineering dewey economics hayden humanities and science lewis music and rotch arts and architecture there are also various specialized
