service life a products service life is its expected lifetime or the acceptable period of use in service not to be confused with shelf life which deals with storage time it is the time that any manufactured item can be expected to be serviceable or supported by its manufacturercitation needed expected service life consists of business policy using tools and calculations from maintainability and reliability analysis service life is a unique commitment made by the items manufacturer and is usually specified as a median actual service life is the maximal recorded life of a product service life is different from a predicted life or mttfmtbf mean time to failuremean time between failuresmfop maintenance-free operating period predicted life is useful such that a manufacturer may estimate by hypothetical modeling and calculation a general rule for which it will honor warranty claims or planning for mission fulfillment the difference between service life and predicted life is most clear when considering mission time and reliability in comparison to mtbf and service life for example a missile system can have a mission time of less than one minute a service life of 20 years active mtbf of 20 minutes dormant mtbf of 50 years and a reliability of .999999 a consumer item will have different expectations about service and longevity 1 based upon factors such as use cost and quality  contents 1 product strategy 2 examples 3 bol and eol 4 see also 5 references  product strategyedit manufacturers will commit to very conservative service life usually 2 to 5 years for most commercial and consumer products for example computer peripherals and components however for large and expensive durable goods the items are not consumable and service lives and maintenance activity will factor large in the service life again an airliner might have a mission time of 11 hours a predicted active mtbf of 10,000 hours with maintenance or 15,000 hours without maintenance a reliability of .99999 and a service life of 40 years the most common model for item lifetime is the bathtub curve a plot of the varying failure rate as a function of time during early life the bathtub shows increased failures usually witnessed during product development the middle portion of the bathtub or useful life is a slightly inclined nearly constant failure rate period where the consumer enjoys the benefit conferred by the product as the time increases further the curve reaches a period of increasing failures modeling the products wearout phase for an individual product the component parts may each have independent service lives resulting in several bathtub curves for instance a tire will have a service life partitioning related to the tread and the casing examplesedit for maintainable items those wear-out items that are determined by logistical analysis to be provisioned for sparing and replacement will assure a longer service life than manufactured items without such planning a simple example is automotive tires - failure to plan for this wear out item would limit automotive service life to the extent of a single set of tires an individual tires life follows the bathtub curve to boot after installation there is a not-small probability of failure which may be related to material or workmanship or even to the process for mounting the tire which may introduce some small damage after the initial period the tire will perform given no defect introducing event such as encountering a road hazard a nail or a pothole for a long duration relative to its expected service life which is a function of several variables design material process after a period the failure probability will rise for some tires this will occur after the tread is worn out then a secondary market for tires puts a retread on the tire thereby extending the service life it is not uncommon for an 80,000-mile tire to perform well beyond that limit 2 it may be difficult to obtain reliable longevity data about many consumer products as in general efforts at actuarial analysis are not taken to the same extent as found with that needed to support insurance decisions however some attempts to provide this type of information have been made an example is the collection of estimates for household components provided by the old house web 3 which gathers data from the appliance statistical review and various institutes involved with the homebuilding trade bol and eoledit for certain products such as those that cannot be serviced during their operational life for technical reasons a manufacturer may calculate a products expected performance at both the beginning of operational life bol and end of operational life eol batteries and other components that degrade over time may affect the operation of a product the performance of mission critical components is therefore calculated for eol with the components exceeding their specification at bol for example with spaceflight hardware which must survive in the harsh environment of space the capacity to generate electricity from solar panels or radioisotope thermoelectric generator is likely to reduce throughout a mission but must still meet a specific requirement at eol in order to complete the mission a spacecraft may also have a bol mass that is greater than its eol mass as propellant is depleted during its operational life see alsoedit planned obsolescence referencesedit ndl 00572591
