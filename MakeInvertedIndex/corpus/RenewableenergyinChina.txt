renewable energy in china biofuel biomass geothermal hydropower solar energy tidal power wave power wind power topics by country 100 renewable energy marketing and policy trends v t e chinas renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity in 2015 china became worlds largest producer of photovoltaic power at 43 gw installed capacity 1 2 china also led the world in the production and use of wind power and smart grid technologies generating almost as much water wind and solar energy as all of france and germanys power plants combined whilst china has the worlds largest installations of solar and wind power its energy needs are so great that in 2013 renewables provided just a little over 20 of its power generation with most of the remainder provided by traditional coal power facilities 3 nevertheless the share of renewables in the energy mix had been gradually rising from 2013 and targets from 2015 onwards have represented a step change in ambition the next few years will demonstrate whether these ambitious targets can be delivered as of the end of 2015 the world leading countries in wind power by installations although the usa generated slightly more wind power at 190 twh as of 186.3 twh in china 4 were 1 china 2 usa 3 germany 4 india 5 spain and 6 uk and in solar power installations 1 china 2 germany 3 japan 4 united states 5 italy and 6 uk in 2013 china had a total capacity of 378 gw of renewable power mainly from hydroelectric and wind power china sees renewables as a source of energy security and not just only to reduce carbon emission 5 chinas action plan for the prevention and control of air pollution issued by chinas state council in september 2013 illustrates the governments desire to increase the share of renewables in chinas energy mix 6 unlike oil coal and gas the supplies of which are finite and subject to geopolitical tensions renewable energy systems can be built and used wherever there is sufficient water wind and sun 7 since 2005 production of solar cells in china has expanded 100-fold as chinese renewable manufacturing has grown the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped dramatically innovation has helped but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion 7  contents 1 renewable electricity overview 2 sources 2.1 hydropower 2.2 wind power 2.3 solar power

far the largest component of renewable electricity production at 920.3 twh wind power provided the next largest share with 141.2 twh followed by biofuels at 38.3 twh solar pv power started from a low base of just 0.152 gwh in 2008 and has grown rapidly since then to reach 15.5 twh by 2013 the overall share of electricity generated from renewable sources based on the figures in the above table has grown from a little over 17 in 2008 to a little over 20 by 2013 whilst later figures are not available between the end of 2013 and 2015 wind turbine installations have increased by more than half and solar power installations have more than doubled see wind power in china and solar power in china for sources sourcesedit hydropoweredit on april 6 2007 the gansu dang river hydropower project 8 was registered as a clean development mechanism cdm project in accordance with the requirements of the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change the project consists of the construction and operation of eight run-of-river hydropower plants providing total capacity of 35.4 gw which will generate an average of 224 gwhyear the project is located in dang town subei mongolian autonomous county gansu province china and was certified by the national development and reform commission ndrc to be in compliance with the measures for the operation and management of clean development mechanism projects in china the power generated by the project will be sold to the gansu power grid which is part of the china northwest regional power grid nwpg this will displace equivalent amounts of electricity generated by the current mix of power sold to the nwpg the developer of the gansu dang river hydropower project which started construction on november 1 2004 is the jiayuguan city tongyuan hydropower co ltd the letter of approval of the ndrc permits the jiayuguan city tongyuan hydropower co ltd to transfer to japan carbon finance ltd an entity approved by the government of japan no more than 1.2 megatons of carbon dioxide emissions in total certified emission reductions cers over the seven-year period beginning on may 1 2007 and ending on april 30 2014 9 in 2006 there were 10 gw of installed hydropower capacity that went into operation in china the national development and reform commission also approved thirteen additional hydropower projects in 2006 which cumulatively will have 19.5 gw of power generating capacity new hydropower projects that were approved and began construction in 2006 include the jinsha river xiangjiaba dam  6000mw the yalong river second phase  4800mw the lancang rivers jinghong dam  1750mw the beipan river 1040mw and the wu rivers silin dam  1080mw in 2005 the following hydroelectric power projects were approved by the ndrc and began construction the jinsha rivers xiluo crossing  12600mw the yellow rivers laxiwa dam  4200mw and the yalong river first phase  3600mw 10 wind poweredit china has the largest wind resources in the world and three-quarters of this natural resource is located at sea 11 china aims to have 100 gw of wind power capacity by 2020 china encourages foreign companies especially from the united states to visit and invest in chinese wind power generation 12 however use of wind energy in china has not always kept up with the remarkable construction of wind power capacity in the country 6 as of 2010 china has become the worlds largest maker of wind turbines surpassing denmark germany spain and the united states 13 the initial future target set by the chinese government was 10 gw by 2010 14 but the total installed capacity for wind power generation in china had already reached 25.1 gw by the end of 2009 15 16 by 2009 china had total installed windpower capacity up to 26 gw 17 china has identified wind power as a key growth component of the countrys economy 18 in 2008 china was the fourth largest producer of wind power after the united states germany and spain 15 at the end of 2008 wind power in china accounted for 12.2 gw of electricity generating capacity by the end of 2008 at least fifteen chinese companies were commercially producing wind turbines and several dozen more were producing components turbine sizes of 1.5mw and 2mw became common leading wind power companies were goldwind dongfang and sinovel 19 china also increased the production of small-scale wind turbines to about 80,000 turbines  80mw in 2008 through all these developments the chinese wind industry appeared unaffected by the global financial crisis according to industry observers 19 solar poweredit china produces 63 of the worlds solar photovoltaics pv 20 it has emerged as the worlds largest manufacturer as of june 2015 21 22 following the new incentive scheme of golden sun announced by the government in 2009 there are numerous recent developments and plans announced by industry players that became part of the milestones for solar industry and technology development in china such as the new thin film solar plant developed by anwell technologies in the henan province using its own proprietary solar technology the agreement was signed by ldk for a 500mw solar project in the desert alongside first solar and ordos city the effort to drive the renewable energy use in china was further assured after the speech of the chinese president given at the un climate summit on 22 september 2009 in new york pledging that china would adopt plans to use 15 of its energy from renewable sources within a decade 23 24 25 china has become a world leader in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic technology with its six biggest solar companies having a combined value of over $15 billion around 820mw of solar pv were produced in china in 2007 second only to japan 26 biomass and biofueledit china emerged as the worlds third largest producer of ethanol-based bio-fuels after the us and brazil at the end of the 10th five year plan period in 2005 and at present ethanol accounts for 20 of total automotive fuel consumption in china 27 in the 11th five year plan period  2006 through 2010 china planned to develop six megatonsyear of fuel ethanol capacity which is expected to grow to 15 megatonsyear by 2020 despite this level of production experts say that there will be no threat to food security though there will be an increasing number of farmers who will be farming oil if the price of crude oil continues to increase based on planned ethanol projects in some provinces in china the output of corn would be insufficient to provide the raw material for plants in these provinces in the recently published world economic outlook the international monetary fund expressed concern that there would be increasing competition worldwide between bio-fuels and food consumption for agricultural products and that that competition would likely continue to result in increases in the price of crops 28 work has begun on the Â¥250 million kaiyou green energy biomass rice husks power generating project located in the suqian city economic development zone in jiangsu province the kaiyou green energy biomass power project will generate 144 gwhyear and use 200 kilotonsyear of crop waste as inputs 29 bioenergy is also used at the domestic level in china both in biomass stoves 30 and by producing biogas from animal manure 31 geothermaledit geothermal resources in china are abundant and widely distributed throughout the country there are over 2,700 hot springs occurring at the surface with temperatures exceeding 250c in 1990 the total flow rate of thermal water for direct uses amounted to over 9,500kgs making china the second direct user of geothermal energy in the world recognizing geothermal energy as an alternative and renewable energy resource since the 1970s china has conducted extensive explorations aiming at identifying high temperature resources for electric generation until 2006 181 geothemal systems had been found on mainland china with an estimated generation potential of 1,740mw however only seven plants with a total capacity of 32mw had been constructed and were operating in 2006 32 national laws and policiesedit after the dissolution of the energy and industry department in 1993 china has been running without a government agency effectively managing the countrys energy related issues are supervised by multiple organizations such as the national development and reform commission ndrc ministry of commerce state electricity regulatory commission serc and so forth in 2008 the national energy administration was founded under the ndrc however its work has been proven inefficient 33 in january 2010 the state council decided to set up a national energy commission nec headed by current chinese premier wen jiabao the commission will be responsible for drafting a national energy development plan reviewing energy security and major energy issues and coordinating domestic energy development and international cooperation 34 the chinese government is implementing multiple policies to promote renewable energy from 2008 to january 2012 china held the top spot in clean energy investment 35 the renewable energy law passed in 2005 explicitly states in its first chapter that the development and the usage of renewable energy is a prioritized area in energy development 36 the twelfth five-year plan the current plan also places great emphasis on green energy 37 detailed incentive policies and programs include the golden sun program which provides financial subsidies technology support and market incentives to facilitate the development of the solar power industry 38 the suggestions on promoting wind electricity industry in 2006 which offers preferential policies for wind power development 39 and many other policies besides promoting policies china has enacted a number of policies to standardize renewable energy products to prevent environmental damage and to regulate the price of green energy these policies include but are not limited to renewable energy law 40 the safety regulations of hydropower dams 41 and the national standard of solar water heaters 42 several provisions in relevant chinese laws and regulations address the development of methane gas in rural china these provisions include article 54 of the agriculture law of the peoples republic of china 43 articles 4 and 11 of the energy conservation law of the peoples republic of china 44 article 18 of the renewable energy law of the peoples republic of china 45 and article 12 of the regulations of the peoples republic of china concerning restoring farmland to forest 46 on april 20 2007 the environment and resources committee of the national peoples congress and the national development and reform commission convened a conference on the occasion of the first anniversary of the renewable energy law there were approximately 250 people who attended the conference from the ministry of finance the ministry of science and technology the ministry of agriculture the ministry of construction the general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine aqsiq the national bureau of forestry the national power network company science and technology institutes oil companies large energy investment companies companies manufacturing renewable energy equipment etc other conferences included the 3rd annual china power  alternative energy summit held from may 16â20 2007 at the swissotel beijing the 2nd china renewable energy and energy conservation products and technology exhibition held from june 1â3 2007 in beijing at the national agricultural exhibition hall and the 2007 china international solar energy and photovoltaic engineering exhibition held at the beijing international exhibition center from june 25â29 2007 the sponsors of the exhibition included the asia renewable energy association the china energy enterprises management association and the china foreign trade and economic cooperation enterprise association cdm projects in chinaedit according to the unfccc database by november 2011 china was the leading host nation for cdm projects with 1661 projects  46.32 of a total of 3586 registered project activities  100 47 according to the iges japan the running total of cers generated by cdm projects in china at 31 march 2011 was topped by hfc reductionavoidance projects  365,577 x 1000tco2-e followed by hydro power  227,693 wind power  149,492 n2o decomposition  102,798 and methane recovery  102,067 48 according to the united nations framework convention on climate change of a total of more than 600 registered cdm projects worldwide through mid-april 2007 there are now 70 registered cdm projects in china the pace of chinese cdm project registration is accelerating prior to the beginning of 2007 china had a total of 34 registered cdm projects yet to date in 2007 another 36 chinese cdm projects have been registered 49 the shanghai power transmission and distribution joint stock company a subsidiary of the shanghai electric and gas group joint stock company entered into a joint venture agreement with canadas xantrex technology inc to build a factory to design manufacture and sell solar and wind power electric and gas electronics products the new company is in the final stages of the approval process 50 according to theo ramborst the general manager and ceo of bosch rexroth china ltd a subsidiary of the bosch group ag a world leader in controls transmission and machine hydraulics manufacturing bosch rexroth china ltd contracted â¬120 million in wind turbo generator business in china in 2006 a 66 increase year-on-year responding to the increase in wind energy business in china bosch rexroth china ltd invested Â¥280 million in october 2006 in plant expansions in beijing and changzhou jiangsu province earlier in 2006 bosch rexroth started up its shanghai jinqiao golden bridge factory which is involved in the manufacture installation distribution and service of transmission and control parts and systems the shanghai facility will also serve as boschs principal center for technology personnel and distribution in china 51 environmental protection and energy conservationedit according to chinas energy blue paper recently written by the chinese academy of social sciences the average rate of recovery of coal from mining in china is only 30 less than one-half the rate of recovery throughout the world the rate of recovery of coal resources in the us australia germany and canada is ~80 the rate of recovery of coal from mining in shanxi province chinas largest source of coal is approximately 40 though the rate of recovery of village and township coal mines in shanxi province is only 10-20 cumulatively over the course of the past 20 years  1980â2000 china has wasted upwards of 28 gigatons of coal 52 the same causes for a low rate of recovery in coal miningthat extraction methods are backwardslead to safety problems in chinas coal mining sector another reason for the low rate of recovery is that the majority of extraction comes from small-scale mining of the 346.9 gigatons of coal extracted by china only 98 gigatons has come from large or mid-sized mines while 250 gigatons are extracted from small mines based on coal production in 2005 of 2.19 gigatons and a current rate of recovery of 30 if china were able to double its rate of recovery it would save approximately 3.5 gigatons of coal 53 on april 13 2007 the department of science technology and education of the chinese ministry of agriculture hosted the asian regional workshop on adaptation to climate change organized by the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc climate change will affect asian countries in different but consistently negative ways temperate regions will experience changes in boreal forest cover while vanishing mountain glaciers will cause problems such as water shortages and increased risks of glacial lake flooding coastal zones are under increasing risk from sea level rises as well as pollution and overexploitation of natural resources in 2006 in china storms floods heat and drought killed more than 2700 people effects ranged from drought in the southwest of china which were the worst since records began to be kept in the late 19th century to floods and typhoons in central and southeastern china the weather events in china in 2006 were seen to be a prelude to weather patterns likely to become more common due to global warming topics discussed by representatives of asian countries and developed countries international organizations and nongovernmental organizations included vulnerability assessments implementing adaptation actions in various sectors of the economy and in specific geographical areas such as coastal and mountainous regions 54 based on a recently completed survey in 2007 the standardization administration of china plans to further develop and improve standards for conservation and comprehensive utilization of natural resources in the following areas energy water wood and land conservation development of renewable energy the comprehensive utilization of mineral resources recovery recycling and reuse of scrap materials and clean production 55 energy production and consumptionedit in 2011 china produced 70 of its energy from coal emitted more carbon dioxide than the next two largest emitters combined the usa and india and emissions had been increasing by 10 a year 56 in 2011 china produced 6 of its energy from hydroelectric <1 from nuclear and 1 from other renewable energy sources 57 chinese energy experts are estimating that by 2050 the percentage of chinas energy requirements that are satisfied by coal-fired plants will have declined to 30-50 of total energy consumption and that the remaining 50-70 will be provided by a combination of oil natural gas and renewable energy sources including hydropower nuclear power biomass solar energy wind energy and other renewable energy sources 58 in 2007 transportations share of crude oil consumption in china is approximately 35 but that by 2020 consumption of crude oil for transportation purposes will have increased to 50 of total crude oil consumption 59 according to a study conducted by the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission on the economic circumstances of chinas crude oil and chemical industry as of 2007 in recent years china has wasted an average of 400 megatons of coal equivalents per year in 2006 china consumed a total of 2.46 gigatons coal equivalents up from 1.4 gigatons of coal equivalents consumed nationwide in 2000 with energy consumption increasing at the rate of 10year in the last 5 years total energy consumption has exceeded the combined amount of energy consumption over the previous 20 years according to dai yande the chairman of the energy research institute of the ndrc while continued high consumption of energy is unavoidable china must take steps to change the form of its economic growth and increase substantially the energy efficiency of chinese industry and society generally among other things china should find new points of economic development that moves china away from being the worlds factory and improves energy efficiency china also must avoid unnecessary waste foster a sustainable economy and encourage renewable energy sources to reduce chinas reliance on petrochemical energy resources 60 since june 2006 when chinese premier wen jiabao visited the shenhua groups coal liquefaction project and expressed that coal-to-liquids production was one important part of chinas energy security there have been many new coal to oil projects announced by many large coal producing provinces and cities as of the end of 2006 there will 88 methyl alcohol projects planned the total capacity of these projects is 48.5 megatonsyear if all of these projects are built by 2010 output of methyl alcohol will reach 60 megatonsyear this development rush to build coal to oil projects is giving rise to concerns about a new round of wasteful development and the unintended consequences of such rapid development these include wasteful extraction of coal excessive use of water this process requires 10 tons of water for every ton of oil produced and likely increases in the price of coal 61 china and russia are in talks to link their electric power networks so that china can purchase power from the russian far east to supply northeast china dongbei the benefits for china of importing power from neighboring countries include conserving domestic resources lowering energy consumption lessening chinas dependence on imported oil  80-90 of which must be shipped through unsafe waters and reducing pollution discharge china already has begun to build a 1 mv high-tension demonstration project and an 800 kv direct power transmission project and after 2010 china will have a long distance high tension high capacity transmission line for international transmission of electric power china also is considering connecting its power transmission lines with mongolia and other former soviet states that border china and specialists predict that by the year 2020 more than 4 pwh of power will be transmitted into china from neighboring states in that year china is expected to produce 250 megatons of crude oil and be required to import approximately 350 megatons of crude oil a reliance on exports of 60 if china is able to import 620 twh of power from neighbors it will be able to reduce crude oil imports by 100 megatons by importing electric from four or five neighboring countries china will not only reduce its dependence on imported crude oil but also will enhance energy security by diversifying its foreign energy sources making china less vulnerable to disruptions in supply 62 in 2006 a total of 2.8344 pwh of electricity was generated in china from an installed base of 622 gw of power generating capacity in 2006 alone an additional 105 gw of installed capacity came on line in china 63 experts estimate that another 100 gw of newly installed electric power generating capacity will again come on-line in 2007 but that 2006 probably was the high-water mark for electric power capacity development in china 64 see alsoedit renewable energy portal energy portal sustainable
