green building mit the cecil and ida green building also called the green building or building 54 is an academic and research building at the massachusetts institute of technology cambridge massachusetts united states it was designed by araldo cossutta and i m pei 1 pei among the worlds most noted architects had received his bachelors degree from mit in 1940 principal donor cecil howard green received a bachelors degree and masters degree from mit and was a co-founder of texas instruments  contents 1 architecture 2 occupancy 3 problems 4 hacks 4.1 pumpkin drop 5 art 6 see also 7

tall with a concrete facade that more or less matches the limestone and concrete of the older mit buildings near it the basement of the building is below sea levelcitation needed and connects to the mit tunnel system three elevators operate in the green building there are staircases at both the east and west sides whose exterior facades present a vast windowless expanse relieved only by one-story tall concrete recessed panels on the ll level actually one story above ground level is room 54-100 a large lecture hall the second floor formerly housed the lindgren library part of mits library system but this separate facility was consolidated into another library in 2009 the green building is the tallest building in cambridge 2 3 when it was built there was a limit on the number of floorscitation needed thus it was designed to be on stilts with the first occupied floor approximately 30 feet above grade in order to circumvent this lawcitation needed the footprint of every floor measures only 60 by 120 feet  18 by 36m which research groups quickly outgrew forcing some of them to disperse elsewhere on campus 4 the towers height has some functional purpose since its roof supports meteorological instruments and radio communications equipment plus a white spherical radome enclosing long-distance weather radar apparatus this technical equipment all requires a line-of-sight vantage point for optimum range and accuracy and would have required construction of some kind of tower to function as intended to minimize interference with radio signals other buildings on mits central campus are less than half the height of the green building and the dormitory towers of eastgate westgate and macgregor house are at least 1500feet  450m away 5 occupancyedit the green building is the main facility of the department of earth atmospheric and planetary science eaps also known as course 12 the departmental headquarters is on the 9th floor of the building the lower floors of the building contain the planetary science section the middle floors have the earth science section geology geophysics and geochemistry the upper floors house the atmospheric science section which also includes oceanography and climatology problemsedit when the green building was first opened the isolated prominence of the building and its relative proximity to the charles river basin increased wind speeds in the high open archway at its base preventing people from entering or leaving the building through the hinged main doors on windy days necessitating use of a tunnel connecting to the other buildings 6 large wood panels were temporarily erected in the open concourse to block the wind and revolving doors were later installed at the ground floor entries to amend this problem somewhat 6 several windows cracked and at least one large pane popped out on upper stories at least in part due to the effects of wind eventually requiring all the windows to be replaced 6 a few years later a similar-appearing problem was repeated in bostons john hancock tower located in back bay across the river a 60-story skyscraper which happened to be designed by the same architectural firm it is incorrectly rumored that alexander calders monumental sculpture the big sail was situated in front of the building to deflect the high winds the sculpture is located too far from the building entryway to have much effect on wind velocities there 7 hacksedit because of its height and visibility from the boston back bay neighborhood across the charles river basin plus its rectangular grid of large 6-by-8-foot  1.8m  2.4m upright rectangular single-pane windows forming a crude 9 x 18 dot-matrix display the green building has been the site of many hacks or pranks 8 in 1993 one widely viewed hack repurposed the nine top-floor windows as an enormous digital vu meter for the traditional fourth of july concert of the boston pops orchestra 9 several other simpler hacks have used the entire window array for stationary displays this practice is sufficiently commonplace to have acquired the term greenspeak 10 11 which should not be confused with the famously obscure delphic pronouncements 12 13 of former federal reserve bank chairman alan greenspan in september 2011 hackers installed 153  9 x 17 custom-made wirelessly controlled color-changing high-power led lights into every window above the first floor they displayed a waving american flag throughout the evening of september 11 2011 in remembrance of the september 11 attacks of 2001 for a short time in the early morning of september 12 the lights displayed a tetris game thus realizing a long-standing hack proposal the holy grail of hacks the display hardware had occasional glitches and was removed as of september 13 the hardware and software designs were further developed and refined for better reliability on april 20 2012 mit hackers successfully turned the green building into a huge playable tetris game operated from a wireless control podium at a comfortable viewing distance in front of the building visitors to campus preview weekend a gathering for admitted prospective freshman students were invited to play the game on the colossal 80-by-250-foot  24m  76m display grid which was claimed to be the second-largest full-color video display in the us 14 15 16 instead of a one-shot temporary installation the hackers have designed and built a permanent facility that can be re-used repeatedly by the mit community an understanding has been reached with the department of earth atmospheric and planetary sciences eaps which is headquartered in the green building to allow the light display hardware to remain installed in each window to avoid annoying the occupants and to allow late-working staff to opt out each light display is equipped with a manual override button which will disable the pixel lighting for that window for several hours after it is pressed in addition the hackers have released open source software tools used to develop new display patterns so that others can design and deploy new stationary or animated images in cooperation with the hacker engineers 14 on the night after the bombings of the boston marathon of april 15 2013 the green building lighting displayed an american flag pattern 17 18 after the shooting death of mit campus patrolman sean collier by the alleged bombers a few days later a 250 foot  76m black ribbon pattern was displayed in his memory 17 as a prototype feasibility demonstration the tech model railroad club located in building n52 had years earlier added a scale model of the green building to its ho scale model railroad layout passersby inside building n52 can view the model building and railway layout through a large window and play a monochromatic version of tetris via remote control accompanied by authentic-sounding music even when the facility is closed 19 other hacks utilize the height of the building such as a 1974 failed attempt to operate a giant yoyo from the roof of the tower 20 21 launching of projectiles from the roof is strongly discouraged due to the unpredictable high wind gusts posing a serious danger to passersby and residents of nearby east campus dormitory pumpkin dropedit at midnight on the last saturday of october 1west the smallest hall in the east campus dorm drops a large number of pumpkins up to the low hundreds off the roof of the green building students come to watch but the area around the foot of the building is quarantined off to prevent anyone from being hit 22 23 24 25 artedit the green building faces mcdermott court also known as the dot 26 this grassy area is flanked by the 33-ton metal sculpture la grande voile the big sail one of alexander calders stabile artworks 27 28 in may 2011 a temporary artwork was installed in the arched breezeway at the base of the green building to take advantage of its legendary wind gusts designed by meejin yoon an associate professor of architecture wind screen was an array of wind-driven micro-turbine generators that would light up whenever there was enough air movement 29 this installation was featured in the fast festival of art science and technology celebration part of the mit 150 commemoration of mits 150th anniversary on may 18th 2013 a night-time projection on the radome on the rooftop of the green building by artist david yann robert beamed the image of bengali polymath and biophysicist sir jagadish chandra bose during a lecture-performance on plant signaling and behavior see alsoedit list of
