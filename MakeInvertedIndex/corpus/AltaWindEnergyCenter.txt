alta wind energy center alta wind energy center awec also known as mojave wind farm is the third largest onshore wind energy project in the world the alta wind energy center is a wind farm located in tehachapi pass of the tehachapi mountains in kern county california as of 2013 it is the largest wind farm in the united states 1 with a combined installed capacity of 1,547mw  2,075,000hp the project being developed near tehachapi pass wind farm site of the first large-scale wind farms installed in the us in the 1970s and 1980sis a powerful illustration of the growing size and scope of modern wind projects 2 3 southern california edison has agreed to a 25-year power purchase agreement for the power produced as part of the power purchase agreements for up to 1,500mw  2,000,000hp or more of power generated from new projects to be built in the tehachapi area the project will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 5.2 million metric tons which is equivalent to taking 446,000 cars off the road 2 a total of 3,000mw  4,000,000hp is planned 4 the wind farm is being developed by terra-gen power which closed a us$1.2billion financing deal in july 2010 with partners that included citibank barclays capital and credit suisse after many delays the first phase began construction in 2010 financing for additional phases of $650 million was secured in april 2012 construction of the alta wind energy center is expected to create more than 3,000domestic manufacturing construction and maintenance jobs and contribute more than one billion dollars to the local economy 2  contents 1 history 2 see also 3 references 4 external links  historyedit the original alta-oak creek mojave project plan consisted of up to 320wind turbines occupying a 9,000-acre  36km2 area while producing 800mw  1,100,000hp of power that project was originally developed by oak creek energy systems under the contract with terra-gen but the project development was later transferred to terra-gen the project then became the first development under the umbrella of alta wind energy center 5 the alta-oak creek mojave project is generally located at the south side of the oak creek road starting a few miles west of the state route 14 in mojave and continuing westward along the oak creek road to the west side of the tehachapi-willow springs road 6 according to the american wind energy association two initial projects were completed in fall 2010 the 150mw  200,000hp alta ii vestas project using 50 3mw  4,000hp generators and the 150mw alta i project using 100 1.5mw generators 7 three subsequent projects 150mw alta iii 102mw  137,000hp alta iv and 168mw alta v projects were completed in the 2nd quarter of 2011 using 50 34 and 56 3mw vestas v-90 wind turbines alta viii and alta vi projects comprising 300mw  400,000hp were completed in late 2011early 2012 alta vii and ix projects comprising 300mw  400,000hp were completed in december 2012 bringing the total to 1,320mw  1,770,000hp but they were renamed to pinyon pines wind i and pinyon pines wind ii 8 138mw  185,000hp alta x and 90mw  120,000hp alta xi are under development with scheduled completion in late 2013 180mw  240,000hp alta xiii in 2019 9 see alsoedit united states portal california portal renewable energy portal energy portal tehachapi wind resource area wind power in california wind power in the united states ivanpah solar power facility referencesedit external linksedit cleanenergyactionprojectcom alta wind energy center v t e american wind energy association nasa wind turbines united states wind energy policy wind farms in the us offshore wind farms in the us wind powering america alaska arizona arkansas california colorado connecticut delaware hawaii idaho illinois indiana iowa kansas kentucky maine maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota montana nebraska nevada new hampshire new jersey new mexico new york north carolina north dakota ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania rhode island south dakota tennessee texas utah vermont virginia washington west virginia wisconsin wyoming alta wind energy center altamont pass biglow canyon buffalo gap capricorn ridge cedar creek fowler ridge highland horse hollow klondike lone star meadow lake panther creek peetz pe√±ascal roscoe san gorgonio pass shepherds flat tehachapi pass windy pointwindy flats aermotor windmill company deepwater wind ge wind energy iberdrola renovables infigen energy invenergy national wind native wind nextera energy resources siemens wind power uge international vestas wind capital group
