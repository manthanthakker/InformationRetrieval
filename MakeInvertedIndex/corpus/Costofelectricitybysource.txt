cost of electricity by source in electrical power generation the distinct ways of generating electricity incur significantly different costs calculations of these costs at the point of connection to a load or to the electricity grid can be made the cost is typically given per kilowatt-hour or megawatt-hour it includes the initial capital discount rate as well as the costs of continuous operation fuel and maintenance this type of calculation assists policy makers researchers and others to guide discussions and decision making the levelised cost of electricity lcoe is a measure of a power source which attempts to compare different methods of electricity generation on a comparable basis it is an economic assessment of the average total cost to build and operate a power-generating asset over its lifetime divided by the total energy output of the asset over that lifetime the lcoe can also be regarded as the minimum cost at which electricity must be sold in order to break-even over the lifetime of the project  contents 1 cost factors 1.1 levelized cost of electricity 1.2 avoided cost 1.3 marginal cost of electricity 1.4 external costs of energy sources 1.5 additional cost factors 2

considered 1 note the use of costs which is not the actual selling price since this can be affected by a variety of factors such as subsidies and taxes capital costs including waste disposal and decommissioning costs for nuclear energy - tend to be low for fossil fuel power stations high for wind turbines solar pv very high for waste to energy wave and tidal solar thermal and nuclear fuel costs - high for fossil fuel and biomass sources low for nuclear and zero for many renewables fuel costs can vary somewhat unpredictably over the life of the generating equipment due to political and other factors factors such as the costs of waste and associated issues and different insurance costs are not included in the following works power own use or parasitic load - that is the portion of generated power actually used to run the stations pumps and fans has to be allowed for to evaluate the total cost of production of electricity the streams of costs are converted to a net present value using the time value of money these costs are all brought together using discounted cash flow 2 3 levelized cost of electricityedit the levelized cost of electricity lcoe also known as levelized energy cost lec is the net present value of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a generating asset it is often taken as a proxy for the average price that the generating asset must receive in a market to break even over its lifetime it is a first-order economic assessment of the cost competitiveness of an electricity-generating system that incorporates all costs over its lifetime initial investment operations and maintenance cost of fuel cost of capital the levelized cost is that value for which an equal-valued fixed revenue delivered over the life of the assets generating profile would cause the project to break even this can be roughly calculated as the net present value of all costs over the lifetime of the asset divided by the total electrical energy output of the asset 4 the levelized cost of electricity lcoe is given by typically the lcoe is calculated over the design lifetime of a plant which is usually 20 to 40 years and given in the units of currency per kilowatt-hour or megawatt-day for example audkwh or eurkwh or per megawatt-hour for example audmwh as tabulated below 5 however care should be taken in comparing different lcoe studies and the sources of the information as the lcoe for a given energy source is highly dependent on the assumptions financing terms and technological deployment analyzed 6 in particular assumption of capacity factor has significant impact on the calculation of lcoe thus a key requirement for the analysis is a clear statement of the applicability of the analysis based on justified assumptions 6 many scholarsspecify such as paul joskow have described limits to the levelized cost of electricity metric for comparing new generating sources in particular lcoe ignores time effects associated with matching production to demand this happens at two levels dispatchability the ability of a generating system to come online go offline or ramp up or down quickly as demand swings the extent to which the availability profile matches or conflicts with the market demand profile thermally lethargic technologies like coal and nuclear are physically incapable of fast ramping capital intensive technologies such as wind solar and nuclear are economically disadvantaged unless generating at maximum availability since the lcoe is nearly all sunk-cost capital investment intermittent power sources such as wind and solar may incur extra costs associated with needing to have storage or backup generation available 7 at the same time intermittent sources can be competitive if they are available to produce when demand and prices are highest such as solar during mid-day peaks seen in summertime load profiles 6 despite these time limitations leveling costs is often a necessary prerequisite for making comparisons on an equal footing before demand profiles are considered and the levelized-cost metric is widely used for comparing technologies at the margin where grid implications of new generation can be neglected another limitation of the lcoe metric is the influence of energy efficiency and conservation eec 8 eec has caused the electricity demand of many countries to remain flat or decline considering only the lcoe for utility scale plants will tend to maximise generation and risks overestimating required generation due to efficiency thus lowballing their lcoe for solar systems installed at the point of end use it is more economical to invest in eec first then solar resulting in a smaller required solar system than what would be needed without the eec measures however designing a solar system on the basis of lcoe would cause the smaller system lcoe to increase as the energy generation measured in kwh drops faster than the system cost  the whole of system life cycle cost should be considered not just the lcoe of the energy source 8 lcoe is not as relevant to end-users than other financial considerations such as income cashflow mortgage leases rent and electricity bills 8 comparing solar investments in relation to these can make it easier for end-users to make a decision or using cost-benefit calculations andor an assets capacity value or contribution to peak on a system or circuit level 8 avoided costedit the us energy information administration has recommended that levelized costs of non-dispatchable sources such as wind or solar may be better compared to the avoided energy cost rather than to the lcoe of dispatchable sources such as fossil fuels or geothermal this is because introduction of fluctuating power sources may or may not avoid capital and maintenance costs of backup dispatchable sources levelized avoided cost of energy lace is the avoided costs from other sources divided by the annual yearly output of the non-dispatchable source however the avoided cost is much harder to calculate accurately 9 10 marginal cost of electricityedit a more accurate economic assessment might be the marginal cost of electricity this value works by comparing the added system cost of increasing electricity generation from one source versus that from other sources of electricity generation see merit ordercitation needed external costs of energy sourcesedit typically pricing of electricity from various energy sources may not include all external costs - that is the costs indirectly borne by society as a whole as a consequence of using that energy source 11 these may include enabling costs environmental impacts usage lifespans energy storage recycling costs or beyond-insurance accident effects the us energy information administration predicts that coal and gas are set to be continually used to deliver the majority of the worlds electricity 12 this is expected to result in the evacuation of millions of homes in low-lying areas and an annual cost of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of property damage 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 furthermore with a number of island nations becoming slowly submerged underwater due to rising sea levels 20 massive international climate litigation lawsuits against fossil fuel users are currentlywhen beginning in the international court of justice 21 22 an eu funded research study known as externe or externalities of energy undertaken over the period of 1995 to 2005 found that the cost of producing electricity from coal or oil would double over its present value and the cost of electricity production from gas would increase by 30 if external costs such as damage to the environment and to human health from the particulate matter nitrogen oxides chromium vi river water alkalinity mercury poisoning and arsenic emissions produced by these sources were taken into account it was estimated in the study that these external downstream fossil fuel costs amount up to 1-2 of the eus entire gross domestic product gdp and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was even included 23 24 coal has the highest external cost in the eu and global warming is the largest part of that cost 11 a means to address a part of the external costs of fossil fuel generation is carbon pricing  the method most favored by economics for reducing global-warming emissions carbon pricing charges those who emit carbon dioxide co2 for their emissions that charge called a carbon price is the amount that must be paid for the right to emit one tonne of co2 into the atmosphere 25 carbon pricing usually takes the form of a carbon tax or a requirement to purchase permits to emit also called allowances depending on the assumptions of possible accidents and their probabilites external costs for nuclear power vary significantly and can reach between 0.2 to 200 ctkwh 26 furthermore nuclear power is working under an insurance framework that limits or structures accident liabilities in accordance with the paris convention on nuclear third-party liability the brussels supplementary convention and the vienna convention on civil liability for nuclear damage 27 and in the us the price-anderson act it is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity but the cost is small amounting to about 0.1 of the levelized cost of electricity according to a cbo study 28 these beyond-insurance costs for worst-case scenarios are not unique to nuclear power as hydroelectric power plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the banqiao dam disaster where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died or large dam failures in general as private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios major disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the state 29 because externalities are diffuse in their effect external costs can not be measured directly but must be estimated one approach estimate external costs of environmental impact of electricity is the methodological convention of federal environment agency of germany that method arrives at external costs of electricity from lignite at 10.75 eurocentkwh from hard coal 8.94 eurocentkwh from natural gas 4.91 eurocentkwh from photovoltaic 1.18 eurocentkwh from wind 0.26 eurocentkwh and from hydro 0.18 eurocentkwh 30 for nuclear the federal environment agency indicates no value as different studies have results that vary by a factor of 1,000 it recommends the nuclear given the huge uncertainty with the cost of the next inferior energy source to evaluate 31 based on this recommendation the federal environment agency and with their own method the forum ecological-social market economy arrive at external environmental costs of nuclear energy at 10.7 to 34 ctkwh 32 additional cost factorsedit calculations often do not include wider system costs associated with each type of plant such as long distance transmission connections to grids or balancing and reserve costs calculations do not include externalities such as health damage by coal plants nor the effect of co2 emissions on the climate change ocean acidification and eutrophication ocean current shifts decommissioning costs of nuclear plants are usually not included the usa is an exception because the cost of decommissioning is included in the price of electricity per the nuclear waste policy act is therefore not full cost accounting these types of items can be explicitly added as necessary depending on the purpose of the calculation it has little relation to actual price of power but assists policy makers and others to guide discussions and decision makingcitation needed these are not minor factors but very significantly affect all responsible power decisions comparisons of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions show coal for instance to be radically higher in terms of ghgs than any alternative accordingly in the analysis below carbon captured coal is generally treated as a separate source rather than being averaged in with other coal other environmental concerns with electricity generation include acid rain ocean acidification and effect of coal extraction on watersheds various human health concerns with electricity generation including asthma and smog now dominate decisions in developed nations that incur health care costs publicly a harvard university medical school study estimates the us health costs of coal alone at between 300 and 500 billion us dollars annually 33 while cost per kwh of transmission varies drastically with distance the long complex projects required to clear or even upgrade transmission routes make even attractive new supplies often uncompetitive with conservation measures see below because the timing of payoff must take the transmission upgrade into account studiesedit australiaedit the first table in this section gives a selection of lcoe from two major government reports from australia 34 35 these figures do not include any cost for the greenhouse gas emissions such as under carbon tax or emissions trading scenarios associated with the different technologies renewables advocates assert that the cost for wind and solar has dramatically reduced since 2006 for example the climate council claims over the 5 years between 2009-2014 solar costs fell by 75 making them comparable to coal and are expected to continue dropping over the next 5 years by another 45 from 2014 prices however supporting data is unclear 36 another claim is that wind has been cheaper than coal since 2013 and that coal and gas will become less viable as subsidies are withdrawn and there is the expectation that they will eventually have to pay the costs of pollution 36 most energy industry reports will counter that solar and wind cannot replace base load electricity sources due to the intermittent nature of production and that the necessity to maintain unused base load power generation increases the cost of any substantial shift to renewables 37 the second table gives a selection of lcoe with and without a carbon price for coal brown and black with and without ccs and wind from the australian technology assessment  2012 table 5.2.1 38 the chart

article on the conversation in 2015 40 franceedit the international agency for the energy and edf have estimated for 2011 the following costs for the nuclear power they include the costs due to new safety investments to upgrade the french nuclear plant after the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster the cost for those investments is estimated at 4 mwh concerning the solar power the estimate at 293 mwh is for a large plant capable to produce in the range of 50–100 gwhyear located in a favorable location such as in southern europe for a small household plant capable to produce typically around 3 mwhyear the cost is according to the location between 400 and 700 mwh currently solar power is by far the most expensive renewable source to produce electricity among the technologies studiedcitation needed although increasing efficiency and longer lifespan of photovoltaic panels together with reduced production costs could make this source of energy more competitive germanyedit in november 2013 the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise assessed the levelised generation costs for newly built power plants in the german electricity sector 41 pv systems reached lcoe between 0.078 and 0.142 eurokwh in the third quarter of 2013 depending on the type of power plant ground-mounted utility-scale or small rooftop solar pv and average german insolation of 1000 to 1200 kwhm per year ghi there are no lcoe-figures available for electricity generated by recently built german nuclear power plants as none have been constructed since the late 1980s japanedit a 2010 study by the japanese government pre-fukushima disaster called the energy white paper concluded the cost for kilowatt hour was ¥49 for solar ¥10 to ¥14 for wind and ¥5 or ¥6 for nuclear power masayoshi son an advocate for renewable energy however has pointed out that the government estimates for nuclear power did not include the costs for reprocessing the fuel or disaster insurance liability son estimated that if these costs were included the cost of nuclear power was about the same as wind power 42 43 44 united kingdomedit the institution of engineers and shipbuilders in scotland commissioned a former director of operations of the british national grid colin gibson to produce a report on generation levelised costs that for the first time would include some of the transmission costs as well as the generation

the interactions of dispatchable energy technologies fossil and nuclear and variable renewables solar and wind in terms of their effects on electricity systems these grid-level systems costs differ from the levelized cost of electricity metric that scholars like paul joskow have criticised as incomplete as they also include costs related to the electricity grid such as extending and reinforcing transport and distribution grids connecting new capacity to the grid and the additional costs of providing back-up capacity for balancing the grid nea calculated these costs for a number of oecd countries with different levels of penetration for each energy source 71 this report has been criticized for its adequacy and used methodology 72 73 swedish kth in stockholm published a report in response finding several question marks concerning the calculation methods 74:5 while the grid-level systems costs in the 2012 oecd-nea report is calculated to be $17.70 per mwh for 10 onshore wind in finland the swedish royal institute of technology concludes in their analysis that these costs are rather $0 to $3.70 per mwh or 79 to 100 less than neas calculations as they are either much smaller or already included in the market 74:23–24 brookings institution  2014edit in 2014 the brookings institution published the net benefits of low and no-carbon electricity technologies which states after performing an energy and emissions cost analysis that the net benefits of new nuclear hydro and natural gas combined cycle plants far outweigh the net benefits of new wind or solar plants with the most cost effective low carbon power technology being determined to be nuclear power 75 76 comparison different studies  2004–2009edit several studies compared the levelized cost of nuclear and fossil

exergetic cost  2014edit as long as exergy stands for the useful energy required for an economic activity to be accomplished it is reasonable to evaluate the cost of the energy on the basis of its exergy content besides as exergy can be considered as measure of the departure of the environmental conditions it also serves as an indicator of environmental impact taking into account both the efficiency of supply chain from primary exergy inputs and the efficiency of the production processes in this way exergoeconomy can be used to rationally distribute the exergy costs and co2 emission cost among the products and by-products of a highly integrated brazilian electricity mix based on the thermoeconomy methodologies some authors 77 have shown that exergoeconomy provides an opportunity to quantify the renewable and non-renewable specific exergy consumption to properly allocate the associated co2 emissions among the streams of a given production route as well as to determine the overall exergy conversion efficiency of the production processes accordingly the non-renewable unit exergy cost cnr kjkj is defined as the rate of non-renewable exergy necessary to produce one unit of exergy rateflow rate of a substance fuel electricity work or heat flow whereas the total unit exergy cost ct includes the renewable cr and non-renewable unit exergy costs analogously the co2 emission cost cco2 gco2kj is defined as the rate of co2 emitted to obtain one unit of exergy rateflow rate 77 analysis from different sources  2009edit price of oil per barrel bbl at which energy sources are

prices have fallen from $76.67 per watt in 1977 to an estimated $0.30 per watt in 2015 for crystalline silicon solar cells 79 80 this is seen as evidence supporting swansons law which states that solar cell prices fall 20 for every doubling of cumulative shipments the famous moores law calls for a doubling of transistor count every two years by 2011 the price of pv modules per mw had fallen by 60 since 2008 according to bloomberg new energy finance estimates putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in some sunny countries an alternative and consistent price decline figure of 75 from 2007 to 2012 has also been published 81 though it is unclear whether these figures are specific to the united states or generally global the levelised cost of electricity lcoe from pv is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions 6 particularly when the time of generation is included as electricity is worth more during the day than at night 82 there has been fierce competition in the supply chain and further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar lie ahead posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years 83 as time progresses renewable energy technologies generally get cheaper 84 85 while fossil fuels generally get more expensive the less solar power costs the more favorably it compares to conventional power and the more attractive it becomes to utilities and energy users around the globe utility-scale solar power could in 2011 be delivered in california at prices well below $100mwh $0.10kwh less than most other peak generators even those running on low-cost natural gas lower solar module costs also stimulate demand from consumer markets where the cost of solar compares very favourably to retail electric rates 86 in the year 2015 first solar agreed to supply solar power at 3.87 centskwh levelised price from its 100 mw playa solar 2 project which is far cheaper than the electricity sale price from conventional electricity generation plants 87 from january 2015 through may 2016 records have continued to fall quickly and solar electricity prices which have reached levels below 3 centskwh continue to fall 88 in august 2016 chile announced a new record low contract price to provide solar power for $29.10 per megawatt-hour mwh 89 in september 2016 abu dhabi announced a new record breaking bid price promising to provide solar power for $24.2 per megawatt-hour mwh  90 it is now evident that given a carbon price of $50ton which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5ckwh solar pv wind and nuclear will be cost-competitive in most locations the declining price of pv has been reflected in rapidly growing installations totaling about 23 gw in 2011 although some consolidation is likely in 2012 due to support cuts in the large markets of germany and italy strong growth seems likely to continue for the rest of the decade already by one estimate total investment in renewables for 2011 exceeded investment in carbon-based electricity generation 91 in the case of self consumption payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not brought from the grid additionally using pv solar power to charge dc batteries as used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles leads to greater efficiencies but higher costs traditionally dc generated electricity from solar pv must be converted to ac for buildings at an average 10 loss during the conversion inverter technology is rapidly improving and current equipment have reached over 96 efficiency for small scale residential while commercial scale three-phase equipment can reach well above 98 efficiency however an additional efficiency loss occurs in the transition back to dc for battery driven devices and vehicles and using various interest rates and energy price changes were calculated to find present values that range from $2,057.13 to $8,213.64 analysis from 2009 92 it is also possible to combine solar pv with other technologies to make hybrid systems which enable more stand alone systems the calculation of lcoes becomes more complex but can be done by aggregating the costs and the energy produced by each component as for example pv and cogen and batteries  93 while reducing energy- and electricity-related greenhouse gas emissions as compared to conventional sources 94 wind poweredit in 2004 wind energy cost a fifth of what it did in the 1980s and some expected that downward trend to continue as larger multi-megawatt turbines were mass-produced 96 as of 2012update capital costs for wind turbines are substantially lower than 2008–2010 but are still above 2002 levels 97 a 2011 report from the american wind energy association stated winds costs have dropped over the past two years in the range of 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour recently about 2 cents cheaper than coal-fired electricity and more projects were financed through debt arrangements than tax equity structures last year winning more mainstream acceptance from wall streets banks equipment makers can also deliver products in the same year that they are ordered instead of waiting up to three years as was the case in previous cycles 5,600 mw of new installed capacity is under construction in the united states more than double the number at this point in 2010 35 of all new power generation built in the united states since 2005 has come from wind more than new gas and coal plants combined as power providers are increasingly enticed to wind as a convenient hedge against unpredictable commodity price moves 98 this cost has additionally reduced as wind turbine technology has improved there are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency also wind project capital and maintenance costs have continued to decline 99 for example the wind industry in the usa in 2014 was able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades capturing the faster winds at higher elevations this has opened up new opportunities in indiana michigan and ohio the price of power from wind turbines built 300 to 400ft  91 to 122m above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio saying it is their cheapest option 100 in 2016 the norwegian wind energy association norwea estimated the lcoe of a typical norwegian wind farm at 44mwh assuming a weighted average cost of capital of 8 and an annual 3,500 full load hours ie a capacity factor of 40 norwea went on to estimate the lcoe of the 1gw fosen vind onshore wind farm which is expected to be operational by 2020 to be as low as 35mwh to 40mwh 101 see alsoedit energy
