electrical energy efficiency on united states farms electrical energy efficiency on united states farms covers the use of electricity on farms and the methods and incentives for improving the efficiency of that use us farms have almost doubled their average energy efficiency over the past 25 years 1  contents 1 usage 1.1 use on dairy farms 2 regulations 3 efficiency increases 3.1 crop

utility incentives  usageedit energy costs represent between 2 at cattle feed lots and 9 for grain farming due partly to grain drying of farm production costs 2 use on dairy farmsedit in 2006 there were about 65,000 dairy farms in the united states although most had fewer than 200 cows 3 one resource auditor believes it is possible for dairy farms to reach an energy usage of as low as 200 kwhr per cow per year 4 although an analysis of california dairy farms found that 300 kwhryear was the lowest actually attained 5 one study 6 7 found the following electrical usages on new york dairy farms milk cooling  23 ventilation  21 vacuum pumps  18 lighting  17 electrical water heating  10 feeding equipment  7 another study 8 found highly similar results regulationsedit hitherto almost entirely unregulated except for zoning ordinances and the effects of property taxes environmental concerns are now beginning to impose restrictions on farms how renewable energy projects may be implemented and also on what rate of return electricity producers can obtain from utilities are key current topics acts such as wisconsins clean energy jobs act only proposed as of april 2010 are controversial among farmers for these reasons 9 canadas green energy act 2009 implemented similar kinds of regulations 10 contrarily carbon offsets may soon offer farmers additional incentives to increase energy use efficiency however at least one proposed cap and trade process would raise farmers costs by up to $1.19 usd per acre 11 corporate average fuel economy fuel standards too such as in the energy independence and security act of 2007 are controversial as biofuels are now a significant portion of farm income 12 efficiency increasesedit increased efficiency in farm usage of electricity is being driven by greening as well as by economics the biggest users of electrical power are heat light and motors  a recent study found that a 3-hp energy efficient compressor used over 42 percent fewer kilowatt-hours kwhr than a 3-hp conventional compressor 13 two prime areas for efficiency improvements are implementing the use of heat recovery systems and variable speed drives 14 one organization postulated a three-year plan for farms to use energy better 15 crop rotationedit simply including years of either clover or alfalfa into the cycle of grain crops can yield savings without reducing total crop yields 16 17 farm energy auditsedit farms sometimes use accredited resource auditors 18 to analyze their operations and recommend improved efficiencies typically at costs exceeding $1,000 per audit however typical full repayment of an audits cost could be around six years 19 also a certified farm energy audit may be required for participation in state or federal energy efficiency programs 20 an audit of 20 farms in cumbria showed savings could be made in all areas examined 21 an example of a farm energy audit in maine is at the following reference 22 maryland has a statewide program entitled ensave 23 energy calculatorsedit recently a number of energy calculators 24 25 have become available addressing one or more aspects of farm energy usage new calculators are being developed under government and utility grants such as one in oregon dairy farm efficiency improvementsedit some improvements are specific to dairy farms such as using supplemental lighting with energy efficient lamps which can increase milk production 5 to 16 percent or relieving heat stress with a combination of sprinklers and fans to increase the cooling effect and improve energy use 26 california compiled a complete guide to dairy farm efficiency improvements 5 cow manure to electrical generationedit norswiss farms of rice lake wisconsin an 1100 cow dairy farm expects to save over $70,000 per year plus income from electricity sales from its installation of an 848kw combined heat and power chp system operating on anaerobic digesters gas from cow manure 27 the electricity generated is sold to the grid a similar installation in 2004 on a 270 cow farm in california one of five in the state at that time powered a 75kw generator 28 central vermont public service has a cow power program using methane-fueled electricity from vermont farms 29 30 government and utility incentivesedit us utilities allocated $5.3 billion to energy efficiency programs in 2009 31 government and utility incentives can be beneficial to those entities as well it may be less expensive for governments to encourage efficiency and renewable energy options in order to delay or negate the need to upgrade and modernize rural grid infrastructure 2 a partial list of incentives is available at the following reference 32 a link to relevant utility pages is at 33 a third partial list is at 34 alliant energy in wisconsin funds the installation of energy-saving projects receiving payments on the monthly electric bills 35 national grid has a similar program 36 see alsoedit agricultureenergy
