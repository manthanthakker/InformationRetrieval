demand response demand response is a change in the power consumption of an electric utility customer to better match the demand for power with the supply electric energy can not be easily stored so utilities have traditionally matched demand and supply by throttling the production rate of their power plants taking generating units on or off line or importing power from other utilities there are limits to what can be achieved on the supply side because some generating units can take a long time to come up to full power some units may be very expensive to operate and demand can at times be greater than the capacity of all the available power plants put together demand response seeks to adjust the demand for power instead of adjusting the supply utilities may signal demand requests to their customers in a variety of ways including simple off-peak metering in which power is cheaper at certain times of the day and smart metering in which explicit requests or changes in price can be communicated to customers the customer may adjust power demand by postponing some tasks that require large amounts of electric power or may decide to pay a higher price for their electricity some customers may switch part of their consumption to alternate sources such as on-site diesel generators in many respects demand response can be put simply as a technology-enabled economic rationing system for electric power supply in demand response voluntary rationing is accomplished by price incentivesoffering lower net unit pricing in exchange for reduced power consumption in peak periods the direct implication is that users of electric power capacity not reducing usage load during peak periods will pay surge unit prices whether directly or factored into general rates involuntary rationing if employed would be accomplished via rolling blackouts during peak load periods practically speaking summer heat waves and winter deep freezes might be characterized by planned power outages for consumers and businesses if voluntary rationing via incentives fail to reduce load adequately to match total power supply  contents 1 background 2 smart grid application 3 electricity pricing 4

references 9.1 importance for the operation of electricity markets  backgroundedit according to the federal energy regulatory commission demand response dr is defined as 1 changes in electric usage by end-use customers from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the price of electricity over time or to incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability is jeopardized dr includes all intentional modifications to consumption patterns of electricity of induce customers that are intended to alter the timing level of instantaneous demand or the total electricity consumption 2 it is expected that demand response programs will be designed to decrease electricity consumption or shift it from on-peak to off-peak periods depending on consumers preferences and lifestyles 3 demand response can be defined as a wide range of actions which can be taken at the customer side of the electricity meter in response to particular conditions within the electricity system such as peak period network congestion or high prices 4 demand response is a reduction in demand designed to reduce peak demand or avoid system emergencies hence demand response can be a more cost-effective alternative than adding generation capabilities to meet the peak and or occasional demand spikes the underlying objective of dr is to actively engage customers in modifying their consumption in response to pricing signals the goal is to reflect supply expectations through consumer price signals or controls and enable dynamic changes in consumption relative to price 5 in electricity grids dr is similar to dynamic demand mechanisms to manage customer consumption of electricity in response to supply conditions for example having electricity customers reduce their consumption at critical times or in response to market prices 6 the difference is that demand response mechanisms respond to explicit requests to shut off whereas dynamic demand devices passively shut off when stress in the grid is sensed demand response can involve actually curtailing power used or by starting on-site generation which may or may not be connected in parallel with the grid 7 this is a quite different concept from energy efficiency which means using less power to perform the same tasks on a continuous basis or whenever that task is performed at the same time demand response is a component of smart energy demand which also includes energy efficiency home and building energy management distributed renewable resources and electric vehicle charging 8 current demand response schemes are implemented with large and small commercial as well as residential customers often through the use of dedicated control systems to shed loads in response to a request by a utility or market price conditions services lights machines air conditioning are reduced according to a preplanned load prioritization scheme during the critical time frames an alternative to load shedding is on-site generation of electricity to supplement the power grid under conditions of tight electricity supply demand response can significantly decrease the peak price and in general electricity price volatility demand response is generally used to refer to mechanisms used to encourage consumers to reduce demand thereby reducing the peak demand for electricity since electrical generation and transmission systems are generally sized to correspond to peak demand plus margin for forecasting error and unforeseen events lowering peak demand reduces overall plant and capital cost requirements depending on the configuration of generation capacity however demand response may also be used to increase demand load at times of high production and low demand some systems may thereby encourage energy storage to arbitrage between periods of low and high demand or low and high prices there are three types of demand response - emergency demand response economic demand response and ancillary services demand response 9 emergency demand response is employed to avoid involuntary service interruptions during times of supply scarcity economic demand response is employed to allow electricity customers to curtail their consumption when the productive or convenience of consuming that electricity is worth less to them than paying for the electricity ancillary services demand response consists of a number of specialty services that are needed to ensure the secure operation of the transmission grid and which have traditionally been provided by generators smart grid applicationedit smart grid applications improve the ability of electricity producers and consumers to communicate with one another and make decisions about how and when to produce and consume electrical power 8 10 this emerging technology will allow customers to shift from an event-based demand response where the utility requests the shedding of load towards a more 24/7-based demand response where the customer sees incentives for controlling load all the time although this back-and-forth dialogue increases the opportunities for demand response customers are still largely influenced by economic incentives and are reluctant to relinquish total control of their assets to utility companies 11 one advantage of a smart grid application is time-based pricing customers who traditionally pay a fixed rate for consumed energy kwh and requested peak load can set their threshold and adjust their usage to take advantage of fluctuating prices this may require the use of an energy management system to control appliances and equipment and can involve economies of scale another advantage mainly for large customers with generation is being able to closely monitor shift and balance load in a way that allows the customer to save peak load and not only save on kwh and kwmonth but be able to trade what they have saved in an energy market again this involves sophisticated energy management systems incentives and a viable trading market smart grid applications increase the opportunities for demand response by providing real time data to producers and consumers but the economic and environmental incentives remain the driving force behind the practice electricity pricingedit in most electric power systems some or all consumers pay a fixed price per unit of electricity independent of the cost of production at the time of consumption the consumer price may be established by the government or a regulator and typically represents an average cost per unit of production over a given timeframe for example a year consumption therefore is not sensitive to the cost of production in the short term eg on an hourly basis in economic terms consumers usage of electricity is inelastic in short time frames since the consumers do not face the actual price of production if consumers were to face the short run costs of production they would be more inclined to change their use of electricity in reaction to those price signals a pure economist might extrapolate the concept to hypothesize that consumers served under these fixed rate tariffs are endowed with theoretical call options on electricity though in reality like any other business the customer is simply buying what is on offer at the agreed price 13 a customer in a department store buying a $10 item at 9.00 am might notice 10 sales staff on the floor but only one occupied serving him or her while at 3.00 pm the customer could buy the same $10 article and notice all 10 sales staff occupied in a similar manner the department store cost of sales at 9.00 am might therefore be 5-10 times that of its cost of sales at 3.00 pm but it would be far-fetched to claim that the customer by not paying significantly more for the article at 9.00 am than at 3.00 pm had a call option on the $10 article in virtually all power systems electricity is produced by generators that are dispatched in merit order ie generators with the lowest marginal cost lowest variable cost of production are used first followed by the next cheapest etc until the instantaneous electricity demand is satisfied in most power systems the wholesale price of electricity will be equal to the marginal cost of the highest cost generator that is injecting energy which will vary with the level of demand thus the variation in pricing can be significant for example in ontario between august and september 2006 wholesale prices in canadian dollars paid to producers ranged from a peak of $318 per mwh to a minimum of - negative $3.10 per mwh 14 15 it is not unusual for the price to vary by a factor of two to five due to the daily demand cycle a negative price indicates that producers were being charged to provide electricity to the grid and consumers paying real-time pricing may have actually received a rebate for consuming electricity during this period this generally occurs at night when demand falls to a level where all generators are operating at their minimum output levels and some of them must be shut down the negative price is the inducement to bring about these shutdowns in a least-cost manner two carnegie mellon studies in 2006 looked at the importance of demand response for the electricity industry in general terms 16 and with specific application of real-time pricing for consumers for the pjm interconnection regional transmission authority 17 the latter study found that even small shifts in peak demand would have a large effect on savings to consumers and avoided costs for additional peak capacity a 1 shift in peak demand would result in savings of 3.9 billions of dollars at the system level an approximately 10 reduction in peak demand achievable depending on the elasticity of demand would result in systems savings of between $8 to $28 billion in a discussion paper ahmad faruqui a principal with the brattle group estimates that a 5 percent reduction in us peak electricity demand could produce approximately $35 billion in cost savings over a 20-year period exclusive of the cost of the metering and communications needed to implement the dynamic pricing needed to achieve these reductions while the net benefits would be significantly less than the claimed $35 billion they would still be quite substantial 18 in ontario canada the independent electricity system operator has noted that in 2006 peak demand exceeded 25,000 megawatts during only 32 system hours less than 0.4 of the time while maximum demand during the year was just over 27,000 megawatts the ability to shave peak demand based on reliable commitments would therefore allow the province to reduce built capacity by approximately 2,000 megawatts 19 electricity grids and peak demand responseedit in an electricity grid electricity consumption and production must balance at all times any significant imbalance could cause grid instability or severe voltage fluctuations and cause failures within the grid total generation capacity is therefore sized to correspond to total peak demand with some margin of error and allowance for contingencies such as plants being off-line during peak demand periods operators will generally plan to use the least expensive generating capacity in terms of marginal cost at any given period and use additional capacity from more expensive plants as demand increases demand response in most cases is targeted at reducing peak demand to reduce the risk of potential disturbances avoid additional capital cost requirements for additional plants and avoid use of more expensive andor less efficient operating plants consumers of electricity will also pay higher prices if generation capacity is used from a higher-cost source of power generation demand response may also be used to increase demand during periods of high supply andor low demand some types of generating plant must be run at close to full capacity such as nuclear while other types may produce at negligible marginal cost such as wind and solar since there is usually limited capacity to store energy demand response may attempt to increase load during these periods to maintain grid stability for example in the province of ontario in september 2006 there was a short period of time when electricity prices were negative for certain users energy storage such as pumped-storage hydroelectricity is a way to increase load during periods of low demand for use during later periods use of demand response to increase load is less common but may be necessary or efficient in systems where there are large amounts of generating capacity that cannot be easily cycled down some grids may use pricing mechanisms that are not real-time but easier to implement users pay higher prices during the day and lower prices at night for example to provide some of the benefits of the demand response mechanism with less demanding technological requirements for example in 2006 ontario began implementing a smart meter program that implements time-of-use tou pricing which tiers pricing according to on-peak mid-peak and off-peak schedules during the winter on-peak is defined as morning and early evening mid-peak as mid-day to late afternoon and off-peak as night-time during the summer the on-peak and mid-peak periods are reversed reflecting air conditioning as the driver of summer demand as of may 1 2015 most ontario electrical utilities have completed converting all customers to smart meter time-of-use billing with on-peak rates about 200 and mid-peak rates about 150 of the off-peak rate per kwh load sheddingedit electrical generation and transmission systems may not always meet peak demand requirements the greatest amount of electricity required by all utility customers within a given region in these situations overall demand must be lowered either by turning off service to some devices or cutting back the supply voltage brownouts in order to prevent uncontrolled service disruptions such as power outages widespread blackouts or equipment damage utilities may impose load shedding on service areas via rolling blackouts or by agreements with specific high-use industrial consumers to turn off equipment at times of system-wide peak demand incentives to shed loadsedit energy consumers need some incentive to respond to such a request from a demand response provider see list of providers below demand response incentives can be formal or informal for example the utility might create a tariff-based incentive by passing along short-term increases in the price of electricity or they might impose mandatory cutbacks during a heat wave for selected high-volume users who are compensated for their participation other users may receive a rebate or other incentive based on firm commitments to reduce power during periods of high demand 20 almost never referred to as negawatts 19 commercial and industrial power users might impose load shedding on themselves without a request from the utility some businesses generate their own power and wish to stay within their energy production capacity to avoid buying power from the grid some utilities have commercial tariff structures that set a customers power costs for the month based on the customers moment of highest use or peak demand this encourages users to flatten their demand for energy known as energy demand management which sometimes requires cutting back services temporarily smart metering has been implemented in some jurisdictions to provide real-time pricing for all types of users as opposed to fixed-rate pricing throughout the demand period in this application users have a direct incentive to reduce their use at high-demand high-price periods many users may not be able to effectively reduce their demand at various times or the peak prices may be lower than the level required to induce a change in demand during short time periods users have low price sensitivity or elasticity of demand is low automated control systems exist which although effective may be too expensive to be feasible for some applications technologies for demand reductionedit technologies are available and more are under development to automate the process of demand response such technologies detect the need for load shedding communicate the demand to participating users automate load shedding and verify compliance with demand-response programs gridwise and energyweb are two major federal initiatives in the united states to develop these technologies universities and private industry are also doing research and development in this arena scalable and comprehensive software solutions for dr enable business and industry growth some utilities are considering and testing automated systems connected to industrial commercial and residential users that can reduce consumption at times of peak demand essentially delaying draw marginally although the amount of demand delayed may be small the implications for the grid including financial may be substantial since system stability planning often involves building capacity for extreme peak demand events plus a margin of safety in reserve such events may only occur a few times per year the process may involve turning down or off certain appliances or sinks and when demand is unexpectedly low potentially increasing usage for example heating may be turned down or air conditioning or refrigeration may be turned up turning up to a higher temperature uses less electricity delaying slightly the draw until a peak in usage has passed 21 in the city of toronto certain residential users can participate in a program peaksaver ac 22 whereby the system operator can automatically control hot water heaters or air conditioning during peak demand the grid benefits by delaying peak demand allowing peaking plants time to cycle up or avoiding peak events and the participant benefits by delaying consumption until after peak demand periods when pricing should be lower although this is an experimental program at scale these solutions have the potential to reduce peak demand considerably the success of such programs depends on the development of appropriate technology a suitable pricing system for electricity and the cost of the underlying technology bonneville power experimented with direct-control technologies in washington and oregon residences and found that the avoided transmission investment would justify the cost of the technology 23 other methods to implementing demand response approach the issue of subtly reducing duty cycles rather than implementing thermostat setbacks 24 these can be implemented using customized building automation systems programming or through swarm-logic methods coordinating multiple loads in a facility eg regen energys envirogrid controllers 25 26 27 it was recently announced that electric refrigerators will be sold in the uk sensing dynamic demand which will delay or advance the cooling cycle based on monitoring grid frequency 28 industrial customersedit industrial customers are also providing demand response compared with commercial and residential loads industrial loads have the following advantages 29 the magnitude of power consumption by an industrial manufacturing plant and the change in power it can provide are generally very large besides the industrial plants usually already have the infrastructures for control communication and market participation which enables the provision of demand response moreover some industrial plants such as the aluminum smelter 30 are able to offer fast and accurate adjustments in their power consumption for example alcoas warrick operation is participating in miso as a qualified demand response resource 31 and the trimet aluminium uses its smelter as a short-term mega-battery 32 short-term inconvenience for long-term benefitsedit shedding loads during peak demand is important because it reduces the need for new power plants to respond to high peak demand utilities build very capital-intensive power plants and lines peak demand happens just a few times a year so those assets run at a mere fraction of their capacity electric users pay for this idle capacity through the prices they pay for electricity according to the demand response smart grid coalition 10–20 of electricity costs in the united states are due to peak demand during only 100 hours of the year 33 dr is a way for utilities to reduce the need for large capital expenditures and thus keep rates lower overall however there is an economic limit to such reductions because consumers lose the productive or convenience value of the electricity not consumed thus it is misleading to only look at the cost savings that demand response can produce without also considering what the consumer gives up in the process importance for the operation of electricity marketsedit it is estimated 12 that a 5 lowering of demand would have resulted in a 50 price reduction during the peak hours of the california electricity crisis in 2000–2001 with consumers facing peak pricing and reducing their demand the market should become more resilient to intentional withdrawal of offers from the supply side residential and commercial electricity use often vary drastically during the day and demand response attempts to reduce the variability based on pricing signals there are three underlying tenets to these programs in addition significant peaks may only occur rarely such as two or three times per year requiring significant capital investments to meet infrequent events us energy policy act regarding demand responseedit the united states energy policy act of 2005 has mandated the secretary of energy to submit to the us congress a report that identifies and quantifies the national benefits of demand response and makes a recommendation on achieving specific levels of such benefits by january 1 2007 such a report was published in february 2006 34 the report estimates that in 2004 potential demand response capability equaled about 20,500 megawatts mw 3 of total us peak demand while actual delivered peak demand reduction was about 9,000 mw  1.3 of peak leaving ample margin for improvement it is further estimated that load management capability has fallen by 32 since 1996 factors affecting this trend include fewer utilities offering load management services declining enrollment in existing programs the changing role and responsibility of utilities and changing supplydemand balance to encourage the use and implementation of demand response in the united states the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued order no 745 in march 2011 which requires a certain level of compensation for providers of economic demand response that participate in wholesale power markets 35 the order is highly controversial and has been opposed by a number of energy economists including professor william w hogan at harvard universitys kennedy school professor hogan asserts that the order overcompensates providers of demand response thereby encouraging the curtailment of electricity whose economic value exceeds the cost of producing it professor hogan further asserts that order no 745 is anticompetitive and amounts to an application of regulatory authority to enforce a buyers cartel 36 several affected parties including the state of california have filed suit in federal court challenging the legality of order 745 37 a debate regarding the economic efficiency and fairness of order 745 appeared in a series of articles published in the electricity journal 38 39 40 on may 23 2014 the dc circuit court of appeals vacated order 745 in its entirety 41 on may 4 2015 the united states supreme court agreed to review the dc circuits ruling addressing two questions on january 25 2016 the united states supreme court in a 6-2 decision in ferc v electric power supply assn concluded that the federal energy regulatory commission acted within its authority to ensure just and reasonable rates in the wholesale energy market 43 demand reduction and the use of diesel generators in the uk

is back-up generation with the remaining being load reduction 44 a paper based on extensive half-hourly demand profiles and observed electricity demand shifting for different commercial and industrial buildings in the uk shows that only a small minority engaged in load shifting and demand turn-down while the majority of demand response is provided by stand-by generators 45 see alsoedit energy
