industrial assessment center energy analysis and diagnostic center there are 24 industrial assessment centers in the united states these centers are located at universities across the us and are funded by the united states department of energy doe to spread ideas relating to industrial energy conservation the centers conduct research into energy conservation techniques for industrial applications this is accomplished by performing energy audits or assessments at manufacturers near the particular center the iac program has achieved of over $4.5 billion of implemented energy cost savings since its inception 1  contents 1 history 2 other benefits 3 participating universities 4 references 5 external links  historyedit industrial assessment centers formerly called the energy analysis and diagnostic center eadc program were created by the department of commerce in 1976 and later moved to the doe the iac program is administered through the advanced manufacturing office 2 under the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy the centers were created to help small and medium-sized manufacturing facilities cut back on unnecessary costs from inefficient energy use ineffective production procedures excess waste production and other production-related problems 3 according to instructions from doe currently the centers are only required to focus on reducing wasted energy and increasing energy efficiency while this remains the primary focus of the assessments waste reduction and productivity improvements are still commonly recommended other benefitsedit in addition to providing technical support to small to mid-sized manufacturers through energy assessments the iac program offers several other important benefits apart from the routine energy audits which cover a broad scope of industrial settings and subsystems the iacs provide technical material and workshops promoting energy efficiency iac database rutgers university maintains a large databases of energy efficiency projects in the industrial sector the database contains recommendations from every audit completed by an iac dating back to 1980 as of june 2016 the iac program had finished 17,400 assessments and made over 132,000 recommendations 4 this database is free and open to the public iac alumni the iac program helps train the next generation of energy efficiency engineers hundreds of students participate in the program each year 5 and over 56 of those students pursue careers in energy or energy efficiency 6 participating universitiesedit boise state university idaho state university university of idaho colorado state university oregon state university san diego state university san francisco state university idaho state university university of idaho oklahoma state university university of arkansas wichita state university texas am university university of arkansas wichita state university bradley university indiana university  purdue university indianapolis iowa state university university of dayton university of michigan university of missouri southeast missouri state university university of wisconsinmilwaukee southeast missouri state university north carolina state university tennessee technological university east tennessee state university university of memphis university of alabama university of miami east tennessee state university university of memphis lehigh university syracuse university clarkson university university of delaware west virginia university clarkson university university of massachusetts amherst referencesedit external linksedit iac websites lehigh university boise state university colorado state university university of dayton university of massachusetts at amherst university of missouri oregon state university san francisco state university syracuse university west virginia university san diego state university oklahoma state university texas am university bradley university indiana university  purdue university indianapolis iowa state university of michigan university of wisconsinmilwaukee north carolina state university university of alabama university of miami university of delaware tennessee tech university iac field management office rutgers university iac database rutgers center for advanced energy systems
