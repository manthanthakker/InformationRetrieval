energy conservation in the united states the united states is the second-largest single consumer of energy in the world the us department of energy categorizes national energy use in four broad sectors transportation residential commercial and industrial 1 energy usage in transportation and residential sectors about half of us energy consumption is largely controlled by individual domestic consumers commercial and industrial energy expenditures are determined by businesses entities and other facility managers national energy policy has a significant effect on energy usage across all four sectors  contents 1 transportation 2 residential sector 2.1 home energy consumption averages 2.2 best building practices 3 commercial sector 4 industrial sector 5 government incentives and initiatives 6 see also 7 references 8 external links 2.1 home energy consumption averages 2.2 best building practices  transportationedit the transportation sector includes all vehicles used for personal or freight transportation of the energy used in this sector approximately 65 is consumed by gasoline-powered vehicles primarily personally owned diesel-powered transport trains merchant ships heavy trucks etc consumes about 20 and air traffic consumes most of the remaining 15 2 the two oil supply crisis of the 1970s spurred the creation in 1975 of the federal corporate average fuel economy cafe program which required auto manufacturers to meet progressively higher fleet fuel economy targets the next decade saw dramatic improvements in fuel economy mostly the result of reductions in vehicle size and weight which originated in the late 1970s along with the transition to front wheel drive these gains eroded somewhat after 1990 due to the growing popularity of sport utility vehicles pickup trucks and minivans which fall under the more lenient light truck cafe standard in addition to the cafe program the us government has tried to encourage better vehicle efficiency through tax policy since 2002 taxpayers have been eligible for income tax credits for gaselectric hybrid vehicles a gas-guzzler tax has been assessed on manufacturers since 1978 for cars with exceptionally poor fuel economy while this tax remains in effect it generates very little revenue as overall fuel economy has improved another focus in gasoline conservation is reducing the number of miles driven an estimated 40 of american automobile use is associated with daily commuting many urban areas offer subsidized public transportation to reduce commuting traffic and encourage carpooling by providing designated high-occupancy vehicle lanes and lower tolls for cars with multiple riders in recent years telecommuting has also become a viable alternative to commuting for some jobs but in 2003 only 3.5 of workers were telecommuters ironically hundreds of thousands of american and european workers have been replaced by workers in asia who telecommute from thousands of miles away fuel economy-maximizing behaviors also help reduce fuel consumption among the most effective are moderate as opposed to aggressive driving driving at lower speeds using cruise control and turning off a vehicles engine at stops rather than idling a vehicles gas mileage decreases rapidly with increasing highway speeds normally above 55 miles per hour though the exact number varies by vehicle this is because aerodynamic forces are proportionally related to the square of an objects speed when the speed is doubled drag quadruples according to the us department of energy doe as a rule of thumb each 5mph  8.0kmh you drive over 60mph  97kmh is similar to paying an additional $0.30 per gallon for gas 3 the exact speed at which a vehicle achieves its highest efficiency varies based on the vehicles drag coefficient frontal area surrounding air speed and the efficiency and gearing of a vehicles drive train and transmission residential sectoredit the residential sector refers to all private residences including single-family homes apartments manufactured homes and dormitories energy use in this sector varies significantly across the country due to regional climate differences and different regulation on average about half of the energy used in us homes is expended on space conditioning ie heating and cooling the efficiency of furnaces and air conditioners has increased steadily since the energy crises of the 1970s the 1987 national appliance energy conservation act authorized the department of energy to set minimum efficiency standards for space conditioning equipment and other appliances each year based on what is technologically feasible and economically justified beyond these minimum standards the environmental protection agency epa awards the energy star designation to appliances that exceed industry efficiency averages by an epa-specified percentage despite technological improvements many american lifestyle changes have put higher demands on heating and cooling resources the average size of homes built in the united states has increased significantly from 1,500sqft  140m2 in 1970 to 2,300sqft  210m2 in 2005 the single-person household has become more common as has central air conditioning 23 of households had central air conditioning in 1978 that figure rose to 55 by 2001 as furnace efficiency gets higher appropriate matching of equipment size to distribution system capacity and building load becomes more critical to optimizing equipment ability to maximize efficient operation installing much lower output high efficiency replacement equipment offers opportunity for huge comfort and savings gains but improving the building envelope through air sealing and adding more insulation advanced windows etc should be explored concurrently or before replacement equipment design stage the passive house approach produces superinsulated buildings that approach zero net energy consumption improving the building envelope can also be cheaper than replacing a furnace or air conditioner even lower cost improvements include weatherization which is frequently subsidized by utilities or statefederal tax credits as are programmable thermostats consumers have also been urged to adopt a wider indoor temperature range eg 65f  18c in the winter 80f  27c in the summer one underutilized but potentially very powerful means to reduce household energy consumption is to provide real-time feedback to homeowners so they can effectively alter their energy using behavior low cost energy feedback displays such as the energy detective or wattvision 4 5 have become available a study of a similar device deployed in 500 homes in ontario canada by hydro one 6 showed an average 6.5 drop in total electricity use when compared with a similarly sized control group standby power used by consumer electronics and appliances while they are turned off accounts for an estimated 5 to 10 of household electricity consumption adding an estimated $3 billion to annual energy costs in the usa in the average home 75 of the electricity used to power home electronics is consumed while the products are turned off 7 home energy consumption averagesedit home heating systems 28.9 home cooling systems 14.0 water heating 12.9 lighting 9.0 home electronics 7.1 refrigerators and freezers 5.9 clothing and dish washers 4.5 includes clothes dryers does not include hot water cooking 3.7 computers 2.2 other 4.4 includes small electrics heating elements motors pool and hot tub heaters outdoor grills and natural gas outdoor lighting non end-user energy expenditure 5.4 8 9 energy usage in some homes may vary widely from these averages for example milder regions such as the southern us and pacific coast of the usa need far less energy for space conditioning than new york city or chicago on the other hand air conditioning energy use can be quite high in hot-arid regions southwest and hot-humid zones southeast in milder climates such as san diego lighting energy may easily consume up to 40 of total energy certain appliances such as a waterbed hot tub or pre-1990 refrigerator use significant amounts of electricity however recent trends in home entertainment equipment can make a large difference in household energy use for instance a 50 lcd television average on-time 6 hours a day may draw 300 watts less than a similarly sized plasma system in most residences no single appliance dominates and any conservation efforts must be directed to numerous areas in order to achieve substantial energy savings however ground air and water source heat pump systems solar heating systems and evaporative coolers are among the more energy efficient environmentally clean and cost-effective space conditioning and domestic hot water systems available environmental protection agency and can achieve reductions in energy consumptions of up to 69citation needed best building practicesedit current best practices in building design construction and retrofitting result in homes that are profoundly more energy conserving than average new homes this includes insulation and energy-efficient windows and lighting 10 smart ways to construct homes such that minimal resources are used to cooling and heating the house in summer and winter respectively can significantly reduce energy costs commercial sectoredit the commercial sector consists of retail stores offices business and government restaurants schools and other workplaces energy in this sector has the same basic end uses as the residential sector in slightly different proportions space conditioning is again the single biggest consumption area but it represents only about 30 of the energy use of commercial buildings lighting at 25 plays a much larger role than it does in the residential sector 11 lighting is also generally the most wasteful component of commercial use a number of case studies indicate that more efficient lighting and elimination of over-illumination can reduce lighting energy by approximately fifty percent in many commercial buildings commercial buildings can greatly increase energy efficiency by thoughtful design with todays building stock being very poor examples of the potential of systematic not expensive energy efficient design steffy 1997 commercial buildings often have professional management allowing centralized control and coordination of energy conservation efforts as a result fluorescent lighting about four times as efficient as incandescent is the standard for most commercial space although it may produce certain adverse health effects 12 13 14 15 potential health concerns can be mitigated by using newer fixtures with electronic ballasts rather than older magnetic ballasts as most buildings have consistent hours of operation programmed thermostats and lighting controls are common however too many companies believe that merely having a computer controlled building automation system guarantees energy efficiency as an example one large company in northern california boasted that it was confident its state of the art system had optimized space heating a more careful analysis by lumina technologies showed the system had been given programming instructions to maintain constant 24hour temperatures in the entire building complex this instruction caused the injection of nighttime heat into vacant buildings when the daytime summer temperatures would often exceed 90f  32c this mis-programming was costing the company over $130,000 per year in wasted energy lumina technologies 1997 many corporations and governments also require the energy star rating for any new equipment purchased for their buildings solar heat loading through standard window designs usually leads to high demand for air conditioning in summer months an example of building design overcoming this excessive heat loading is the dakin building in brisbane california where fenestration was designed to achieve an angle with respect to sun incidence to allow maximum reflection of solar heat this design also assisted in reducing interior over-illumination to enhance worker efficiency and comfort recent advances include use of occupancy sensors to turn off lights when spaces are unoccupied and photosensors to dim or turn off electric lighting when natural light is available in air conditioning systems overall equipment efficiencies have increased as energy codes and consumer information have begun to emphasise year round performance rather than just efficiency ratings at maximum output controllers that automatically vary the speeds of fans pumps and compressors have radically improved part-load performance of those devices for space or water heating electric heat pumps consume roughly half the energy required by electric resistance heaters natural gas heating efficiencies have improved through use of condensing furnaces and boilers in which the water vapor in the flue gas is cooled to liquid form before it is discharged allowing the heat of condensation to be used in buildings where high levels of outside air are required heat exchangers can capture heat from the exhaust air to preheat incoming supply air a company in florida tackled the issue of both energy-conservation and enhancing its workplace environment by implementing a conveyor system that is 40-60 quieter than traditional systems emitting a noise level of only 55-50 decibels equivalent to a soft-rock radio station lighting was addressed by not only programming the lighting console so that isolated lights could be switched on and off in designated areas of the warehouse but also by enhancing natural lighting through the use of skylights and a high-gloss floor 16 industrial sectoredit the industrial sector represents all production and processing of goods including manufacturing construction farming water management and mining increasing costs have forced energy-intensive industries to make substantial efficiency improvements in the past 30 years for example the energy used to produce steel and paper products has been cut 40 in that time frame while petroleumaluminum refining and cement production have reduced their usage by about 25 these reductions are largely the result of recycling waste material and the use of cogeneration equipment for electricity and heating another example for efficiency improvements is the use of products made of high temperature insulation wool htiw which enables predominantly industrial users to operate thermal treatment plants at temperatures between 800 and 1400c in these high-temperature applications the consumption of primary energy and the associated co2 emissions can be reduced by up to 50 compared with old fashioned industrial installations the application of products made of high temperature insulation wool is becoming increasingly important against the background of the dramatic rising cost of energy us agriculture has doubled farm energy efficiency in the last 25 years 17 the energy required for delivery and treatment of fresh water often constitutes a significant percentage of a regions electricity and natural gas usage an estimated 20 of californias total energy use is water-related 18 in light of this some local governments have worked toward a more integrated approach to energy and water conservation efforts to conserve energy some industries have begun using solar panels to heat their watercitation needed unlike the other sectors total energy use in the industrial sector has declined in the last decade while this is partly due to conservation efforts it is also a reflection of the growing trend for us companies to move manufacturing operations overseas government incentives and initiativesedit part b of title iii of the energy policy and conservation act established the energy conservation program for consumer products other than automobiles which gives the department of energy the authority to develop revise and implement minimum energy conservation standards for appliances and equipment  19 as currently implemented the department of energy enforces test procedures and minimum standards for more than 50 products covering residential commercial and industrial lighting and plumbing applications 20 the energy policy act of 2005 included incentives which provide a tax credit of 30 of the cost of the new item with a $500 aggregate limit the program was initially set to expire at the end of 2007 but was extended to 2010 and the aggregate limit increased to $1,500 by the energy improvement and extension act of 2008 and the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 when it will expire 21 the states and local areas eg cities or counties have various initiatives and the us department of energy funded a database known as dsire which provides information on these initiatives 22 the state of maryland has set a target of reducing its electricity usage by 15 from 2008 to 2015 23 by executive order 13514 us president barack obama mandated that by 2015 15 of existing federal buildings conform to new energy efficiency standards and 100 of all new federal buildings be zero-net-energy by 2030 see alsoedit earthship energy and the environment environment of the united states passive house portland energy conservation
