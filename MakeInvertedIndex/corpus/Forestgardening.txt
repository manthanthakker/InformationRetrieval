forest gardening forest gardening is a low-maintenance sustainable plant-based food production and agroforestry system based on woodland ecosystems incorporating fruit and nut trees shrubs herbs vines and perennial vegetables which have yields directly useful to humans making use of companion planting these can be intermixed to grow in a succession of layers to build a woodland habitat forest gardening is a prehistoric method of securing food in tropical areas in the 1980s robert hart coined the term forest gardening after adapting the principles and applying them to temperate climates 1

worlds oldest form of land use and most resilient agroecosystem 2 3 they originated in prehistoric times along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of monsoon regions in the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment useful tree and vine species were identified protected and improved whilst undesirable species were eliminated eventually superior foreign species were selected and incorporated into the gardens 4 forest gardens are still common in the tropics and known by various names such as home gardens in kerala in south india nepal zambia zimbabwe and tanzania kandyan forest gardens in sri lanka 5 huertos familiares the family orchards of mexico and pekarangan the gardens of complete design in java 6 these are also called agroforests and where the wood components are short-statured the term shrub garden is employed forest gardens have been shown to be a significant source of income and food security for local populations 7 robert hart adapted forest gardening for the united kingdoms temperate climate during the 1980s 1 his theories were later developed by martin crawford from the agroforestry research trust and various permaculturalists such as graham bell patrick whitefield dave jacke and geoff lawton in tropical climatesedit forest gardens or home gardens are common in the tropics using intercropping to cultivate trees crops and livestock on the same land in kerala in south india as well as in northeastern india the home garden is the most common form of land use and is also found in indonesia one example combines coconut black pepper cocoa and pineapple these gardens exemplify polyculture and conserve much crop genetic diversity and heirloom plants that are not found in monocultures forest gardens have been loosely compared to the religious concept of the garden of eden 8 americasedit the bbcs unnatural histories claimed that the amazon rainforest rather than being a pristine wilderness has been shaped by humans for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta 9 this was also explored in the bestselling book 1491 by author charles c mann since the 1970s numerous geoglyphs have also been discovered on deforested land in the amazon rainforest furthering the evidence about pre-columbian civilizations 10 11 on the yucatán peninsula much of the maya food supply was grown in orchard-gardens known as pet kot 12 the system takes its name from the low wall of stones pet meaning circular and kot wall of loose stones that characteristically surrounds the gardens 13 africaedit in many african countries for example zambia zimbabwe ethiopia and tanzania gardens are widespread in rural periurban and urban areas and they play an essential role in establishing food security most well known are the chaga or chagga gardens on the slopes of mt kilimanjaro in tanzania these are an excellent example of an agroforestry system in many countries women are the main actors in home gardening and food is mainly produced for subsistence in north-africa oasis layered gardening with palm trees fruit trees and vegetables is a traditional type of forest garden nepaledit in nepal the ghar bagaincha literally home garden refers to the traditional land use system around a homestead where several species of plants are grown and maintained by household members and their products are primarily intended for the family consumption shrestha et al 2002 the term home garden is often considered synonymous to the kitchen garden however they differ in terms of function size diversity composition and features sthapit et al 2006 in nepal 72 of households have home gardens of an area 2–11 of the total land holdings gautam et al 2004 because of their small size the government has never identified home gardens as an important unit of food production and they thereby remain neglected from research and development however at the household level the system is very important as it is an important source of quality food and nutrition for the rural poor and therefore are important contributors to the household food security and livelihoods of farming communities in nepal the gardens are typically cultivated with a mixture of annual and perennial plants that can be harvested on a daily or seasonal basis biodiversity that has an immediate value is maintained in home gardens as women and children have easy access to preferred food home gardens with their intensive and multiple uses provide a safety net for households when food is scarce these gardens are not only important sources of food fodder fuel medicines spices herbs flowers construction materials and income in many countries they are also important for the in situ conservation of a wide range of unique genetic resources for food and agriculture subedi et al 2004 many uncultivated as well as neglected and underutilised species could make an important contribution to the dietary diversity of local communities gautam et al 2004 in addition to supplementing diet in times of difficulty home gardens promote whole-family and whole-community involvement in the process of providing food children the elderly and those caring for them can participate in this infield agriculture incorporating it with other household tasks and scheduling this tradition has existed in many cultures around the world for thousands of years 14 15 in mediterranean climatesedit the mediterranean climate has long hot rainless summers and relatively short cool rainy winters köppen climate classification csa 16 its climate conditions are highly variable within an area and modified locally by altitude latitude and the proximity to the mediterranean 16 in the 1950s the forest research department of the ministry of agriculture founded a botanical forest garden in the sharon region in israel the ilanot forest 17 as the only one of its kind in israel it harbours more than 750 species of trees from locations all over the world including the japanese sago palm cycas revoluta fig trees ficus glomerata stone pine trees pinus pinea that produce tasty pine nuts and adds to the biodiversity of israel in temperate climatesedit robert hart coined the term forest gardening during the 1980s hart began farming at wenlock edge in shropshire with the intention of providing a healthy and therapeutic environment for himself and his brother lacon 18 starting as relatively conventional smallholders hart soon discovered that maintaining large annual vegetable beds rearing livestock and taking care of an orchard were tasks beyond their strength however a small bed of perennial vegetables and herbs he planted was looking after itself with little intervention following harts adoption of a raw vegan diet for health and personal reasons he replaced his farm animals with plants the three main products from a forest garden are fruit nuts and green leafy vegetables 19 he created a model forest garden from a 0.12 acre  500m orchard on his farm and intended naming his gardening method ecological horticulture or ecocultivation 20 hart later dropped these terms once he became aware that agroforestry and forest gardens were already being used to describe similar systems in other parts of the world 21 he was inspired by the forest farming methods of toyohiko kagawa and james sholto douglas and the productivity of the keralan home gardens as hart explains 22 from the agroforestry point of view perhaps the worlds most advanced country is the indian state of kerala which boasts no fewer than three and a half million forest gardensas an example of the extraordinary intensivity of cultivation of some forest gardens one plot of only 0.12 hectares  0.30 acres was found by a study group to have twenty-three young coconut palms twelve cloves fifty-six bananas and forty-nine pineapples with thirty pepper vines trained up its trees in addition the small holder grew fodder for his house-cow 23 seven-layer systemedit robert hart pioneered a system based on the observation that the natural forest can be divided into distinct levels he used intercropping to develop an existing small orchard of apples and pears into an edible polyculture landscape consisting of the following layers a key component of the seven-layer system was the plants he selected most of the traditional vegetable crops grown today such as carrots are sun loving plants not well selected for the more shady forest garden system hart favoured shade tolerant perennial vegetables further developmentedit the agroforestry research trust art managed by martin crawford runs experimental forest gardening projects on a number of plots in devon united kingdom 24 crawford describes a forest garden as a low-maintenance way of sustainably producing food and other household products 25 ken fern had the idea that for a successful temperate forest garden a wider range of edible shade tolerant plants would need to be used to this end fern created the organisation plants for a future pfaf which compiled a plant database suitable for such a system fern used the term woodland gardening rather than forest gardening in his book plants for a future 26 27 the movement for compassionate living mcl promote forest gardening and other types of vegan organic gardening to meet societys needs for food and natural resources kathleen jannaway the founder of mcl wrote a book outlining a sustainable vegan future called abundant living in the coming age of the tree in 1991 in 2009 the mcl provided a grant of £1,000 to the bangor forest garden project in gwynedd north west wales 28 kevin bradley coined the phrase edible forest in the 1980s as the name of his nursery garden and orchard on 5 acres in the frigid zone 3 pine forests of northern wisconsin among 3 options he chose edible forest because it evokes at once an ethereal spiritual and magical image of disney- like forest of no return of the biblical garden of eden this image was perfectly in line with his ongoing experiment begun in 1985 in what he calls a closed loop human environment combining multi- story tree and field crop gardenorchards for maximum beauty and use of space someday to be very useful in an ever shrinking world the name at the same time with its irrational first impression of course we cant eat a forest forces the mind to think if just a little bit about its inference and thus sticks in our memories it appeared from bradleys research that the two words had prior to the 80s never been put together before as a noun phrase but which by today after more than two decades of bradleys edible forest nursery and the 2005 text by jacke and toensmeirers- edible forest gardens has grown into a movement and little edible forests all over the world in 2005 dave jacke and eric toensmeiers two-volume edible forest gardens provided a deeply researched reference focused on north american forest gardening climates habitats and species the book attempts to ground forest gardening deeply in ecological science the apios institute wiki grew out of their work and seeks to document and share the experience of people around the world working with the species in polycultures permacultureedit bill mollison who coined the term permaculture visited robert hart at his forest garden in wenlock edge in october 1990 29 harts seven-layer system has since been adopted as a common permaculture design element numerous permaculturalists are proponents of forest gardens or food forests such as graham bell patrick whitefield dave jacke eric toensmeier and geoff lawton bell started building his forest garden in 1991 and wrote the book the permaculture garden in 1995 whitefield wrote the book how to make a forest garden in 2002 jacke and toensmeier co-authored the two volume book set edible forest gardening in 2005 and lawton presented the film establishing a food forest in 2008 30 31 32 austrian sepp holzer

is being funded by the national geographic society and developed at santa familia primary school in cayo 35 in the united states the largest known food forest on public land is believed to be the 7-acre beacon food forest in seattle washington 36 other forest garden projects include those at the central rocky mountain permaculture institute in basalt colorado and montview neighborhood farm in northampton massachusetts 37 38 in canada food forester richard walker has been developing and maintaining food forests in the province of british columbia for over 30 years he developed a 3-acre food forest that when at maturity provided raw materials for a nursery and herbalism business as well as food for his family 39 the living centre have developed various forest garden projects in ontario 40 in the united kingdom other than those run by the agroforestry research trust art there are numerous forest garden projects such as the bangor forest garden in gwynedd north west wales 41 martin
