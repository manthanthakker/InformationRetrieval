international partnership for energy efficiency cooperation website wwwipeecorg ipeec members the partnership for energy efficiency cooperation ipeec is a high-level international forum which includes developed and developing countries its purpose is to enhance global cooperation in the field of energy efficiency and to facilitate policies that yield energy efficiency gains across all sectors globally 1 ipeec provides information to decision-makers in major economies facilitating candid discussions for exchanging ideas and experiences and helping countries undertake joint projects to develop and implement energy efficiency policies and measures at a global scale it is also a forum for member and non-member economies to share information about various bilateral and multilateral initiatives 2 ipeec supported initiatives are open to both member and non-member nations as well as the private sector 3 ipeec is coordinating the implementation of the group of 20 g20 energy efficiency action plan which was agreed by g20 leaders in late 2014 as a practical approach to strengthening voluntary international energy efficiency collaboration and since july 2016 ipeec is coordinating the g20 energy efficiency leading programme eelp that provides the basis for a comprehensive flexible and adequately-resourced framework for strengthened voluntary collaboration on energy efficiency among g20 members and beyond ipeec has two core committees the executive committee and the policy committee both these committees meet twice a year to determine the forward work program and discuss results of current and previous projects 4  contents 1 history 2 membership 3 ipeecs work 3.1 g20 action 3.2 appliances and equipment 3.3 buildings 3.4 industry 3.5 power 3.6 transport 3.7

stpetersburg  2006 summits the group of eight g8 industrialized countries emphasized the need for global cooperation in the field of 33rd g8 summit at heiligendamm in june 2007 5 the g8 approved an eu proposal for an international initiative on energy efficiency and decided to explore the most efficient way to promote energy efficiency worldwide jointly with the international energy agency iea 1 since its creation by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in 1974 the iea has promoted energy efficiency however its members are all developed countries the growing economic interdependence among nations the increasingly globalized energy market and the environmental issues affecting every country make the idea of a worldwide forum particularly relevant ipeec provides a forum that opens up a dialogue on energy economic and environment issues between developed and developing nations as well as the private sector 6 one year after the heiligendamm summit on 8 june 2008 in aomori at the energy ministerial meeting hosted by japan during its g8 presidency the energy ministers from the g8 and from china india south korea and the european community agreed to establish the ipeec 7 in the aomori declaration signed on june 8 2008 the energy ministers acknowledged that all countries  both developed and developing share common interests for improving their energy efficiency performance and that developed countries need to play an important role in cooperation with developing countries accelerating dissemination and transfer of best practices and efficient technologies 8 on may 24 2009 in rome the g8 members china south korea brazil and mexico signed the terms of reference of the ipeec 8 this group signature officially created the ipeec the same day the representatives of these countries also signed the memorandum asking the iea to host the ipeec secretariat 9 the 9th meeting of asia-pacific economic cooperation apec energy ministers in japan in 2010 resulted in the fukui declaration that supported ipeecs goal by stating that improving energy efficiency is one of the quickest greenest and most cost-effective ways to address energy security economic growth and climate change challenges at the same time 10 membershipedit members of ipeec as of october 2016 are australia brazil canada china the european union france germany india italy japan mexico russia south africa south korea united kingdom and united states turkey is currently in the process of joining ipeec ipeec is an autonomous partnership of nations founded in 2009 by the group of 8 g8 to promote collaboration on energy efficiency its membership now includes 16 of the group of 20 g20 economies which represent over 80 of global energy use and over 80 of global greenhouse gas ghg emissions oecd 2015 4 ipeecs workedit ipeec work covers 6 different sectors in each of these sectors task groups are the acting entities that carry ipeecs work each task group is funded directly by its members and the participation is voluntary g20 actionedit ipeec is coordinating the implementation of the group of 20 g20 energy efficiency action plan which was agreed by g20 leaders in november 2014 dedicated task groups are cooperating on six different work streams with the aim of accelerating the adoption of energy efficiency policies each task group is directly funded by its participating members and run by officials from ipeec member countries and other participating nations with the support of various expert organisations the action plan established three new task groups to address recognised gaps and emerging challenges including - networked devices through the networked devices task group ndtg - transport through the transport task group ttg and - finance through the energy efficiency finance task group eeftg appliances and equipmentedit the two task groups that are involved in this sector are - the super-efficient equipment and appliance deployment initiative sead and - networked devices task group ndtg buildingsedit ipeecs work in this sector is led by the buildings energy efficiency task group beet industryedit ipeecs work on these issues is coordinated through the energy management working group emwg which encompasses the energy management action network for industrial efficiency emak poweredit ipeecs current work on the power sector is focused on the dissemination of energy efficient technologies and best practices in thermal power generation through the high efficiency low emissions task group hele transportedit ipeecs work in this sector is led by the transport task group ttg cross-sectoredit ipeec currently oversees three task groups aimed at addressing cross-sectoral issues - energy efficiency finance task group
