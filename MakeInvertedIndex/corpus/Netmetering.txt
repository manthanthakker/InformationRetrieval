e net metering or net energy metering nem allows consumers who generate some or all of their own electricity to use that electricity anytime instead of when it is generated this is particularly important with wind and solar which are non-dispatchable monthly net metering allows consumers to use solar power generated during the day at night or wind from a windy day later in the month annual net metering rolls over a net kilowatt credit to the following month allowing solar power that was generated in july to be used in december or wind power from march in august net metering policies can vary significantly by country and by state or province if net metering is available if and how long you can keep your banked credits and how much the credits are worth retailwholesale most net metering laws involve monthly roll over of kwh credits a small monthly connection fee 1 require monthly payment of deficits ie normal electric bill and annual settlement of any residual credit unlike a feed-in tariff fit which requires two meters net metering uses a single bi-directional meter and can measure current flowing in two directions 2 net metering can be implemented solely as an accounting procedure and requires no special metering or even any prior arrangement or notification 3 net metering is an enabling policy designed to foster private investment in renewable energy

connected to the electrical grid and consumers wanted to be able to use the electricity generated at a different time or date from when it was generated minnesota is commonly cited as passing the first net metering law in 1983 and allowed anyone generating less than 40kw to either roll over any kilowatt credit to the next month or be paid for the excess in 2000 this was amended to compensation at the average retail utility energy rate this is the simplest and most general interpretation of net metering and in addition allows small producers to sell electricity at the retail rate 4 utilities in idaho adopted net metering in 1980 and in arizona in 1981 massachusetts adopted net metering in 1982 by 1998 22 states or utilities therein had adopted net metering two california utilities initially adopted a monthly net metering charge which included a standby charge until the puc banned such charges 5 in 2005 all us utilities were required to offer net metering upon request excess generation is not addressed as of 2016 43 us states have adopted net metering as well as utilities in 3 of the remaining states leaving only 4 states without any established procedures for implementing net metering 6 net metering was slow to be adopted in europe especially in the united kingdom because of confusion over how to address the value added tax vat only one utility company in great britain offers net metering 7 the united kingdom government is reluctant to introduce the net metering principle because of complications in paying and refunding the value added tax that is payable on electricity but pilot projects are underway in some areas in canada some provinces have net metering programs in the philippines net metering scheme is governed by republic act 9513 renewable energy act of 2008 and its implementing rules and regulation irr the implementing body is the energy regulatory commission erc in consultation with the national renewable energy board nreb unfortunately the scheme is not a true net metering scheme but in reality a net billing scheme as the dept of energys net metering guidelines say  net-metering allows customers of distribution utilities dus to install an on-site renewable energy re facility not exceeding 100 kilowatts kw in capacity so they can generate electricity for their own use any electricity generated that is not consumed by the customer is automatically exported to the dus distribution system the du then gives a peso credit for the excess electricity received equivalent to the dus blended generation cost excluding other generation adjustments and deducts the credits earned to the customers electric bill  8 thus philippine consumers who generate their own electricity and sell their surplus to the utility are paid what is called the generation cost which is often less than 50 of the retail price of electricity controversyedit net metering is controversial as it affects different interests on the grid 9 a report prepared by peter kind of energy infrastructure advocates for the trade association edison electric institute stated that distributed generation systems like rooftop solar present unique challenges to the future of electric utilities 10 utilities in the united states have led a largely unsuccessful campaign to eliminate net metering 11 small scale viewpointedit renewable advocates point out that while distributed solar and other energy efficiency measures do pose a challenge to electric utilities existing business model the benefits of distributed generation outweigh the costs and those benefits are shared by all ratepayers 12 grid benefits of private distributed solar investment include reduced need for centralizing power plants and reduced strain on the utility grid they also point out that as a cornerstone policy enabling the growth of rooftop solar net metering creates a host of societal benefits for all ratepayers that are generally not accounted for by the utility analysis including public health benefits employment and downstream economic effects market price impacts grid security benefits and water savings 13 an independent report conducted by the consulting firm crossborder energy found that the benefits of californias net metering program outweigh the costs to ratepayers those net benefits will amount to more than us$92 million annually upon the completion of the current net metering program 14 a 2012 report on the cost of net metering in the state of california commissioned by the california public utilities commission cpuc showed that those customers without distributed generation systems will pay us$287 in additional costs to use and maintain the grid every year by 2020 the report also showed the net cost will amount to us$1.1 billion by 2020 15 notably the same report found that solar customers do pay more on their power bills than what it costs the utility to serve them table 5 page 10 average 103 of their cost of service across the three major utilities in 2011 15 large scale viewpointedit many electric utilities state that owners of generation systems do not pay the full cost of service to use the grid thus shifting their share of the cost on to customers without distributed generation systems 16 most owners of rooftop solar or other types of distributed generation systems still rely on the grid to receive electricity from utilities at night or when their systems cannot generate sufficient power 17 a 2014 report funded by the institute for electric innovation 18 reveals that net metering in california produces excessively large subsidies for typical residential rooftop solar pv facilities these subsidies must then be paid for by other residential customers most of whom are less affluent than the rooftop solar pv customers in addition the report points out that most of these large subsidies go to the solar leasing companies which accounted for about 75 percent of the solar pv facilities installed in 2013 the report concludes that changes are needed in california ranging from the adoption of retail tariffs that are more cost-reflective to replacing net metering with a separate buy all - sell all arrangement that requires all rooftop solar pv customers to buy all of their consumed energy under the existing retail tariffs and separately sell all of their onsite generation to their distribution utilities at the utilities respective avoided costs 19 comparisonedit there is considerable confusion between the terms net metering and feed-in tariff in general there are three types of compensation for local distributed generation net metering only requires one meter a feed-in tariff requires two time of use meteringedit time of use tou net metering employs a special reversible smart electric meter that is programmed to determine electricity usage any time during the day time-of-use allows utility rates and charges to be assessed based on when the electricity was used ie daynight and seasonal rates typically the generation cost of electricity is highest during the daytime peak usage period and lowest at night time of use metering is a significant issue for renewable-energy sources since for example solar power systems tend to produce energy during the daytime peak-price period and produce little or no power during the night period when price is low italy has installed so many photovoltaic cells that peak prices no longer are during the day but are instead in the evening 20 tou net metering affects the apparent cost of net metering to a utility 21 market rate net meteringedit in market rate net metering systems the users energy use is priced dynamically according to some function of wholesale electric prices the users meters are programmed remotely to calculate the value and are read remotely net metering applies such variable pricing to excess power produced by a qualifying system market rate metering systems were implemented in california starting in 2006 and under the terms of californias net metering rules will be applicable to qualifying photovoltaic and wind systems under california law the payback for surplus electricity sent to the grid must be equal to the variable in this case price charged at that time net metering enables small systems to result in zero annual net cost to the consumer provided that the consumer is able to shift demand loads to a lower price time such as by chilling water at a low cost time for later use in air conditioning or by charging a battery electric vehicle during off-peak times while the electricity generated at peak demand time can be sent to the grid rather than used locally see vehicle-to-grid no credit is given for annual surplus production excess generationedit excess generation is a separate issue from net metering but it is normally dealt with in the same rules because it can arise if local generation offsets a portion of the demand net metering is not used if local generation exceeds demand some of the time for example during the day net metering is used if local generation exceeds demand for the billing cycle best practices calls for a perpetual roll over of the kilowatt credits although some regions have considered having any kilowatt credits expire after 36 months the normal definition of excess generation is annually although the term is equally applicable monthly the treatment of annual excess generation and monthly ranges from lost to compensation at avoided cost to compensation at retail rate 22 left over kilowatt credits upon termination of service would ideally be paid at retail rate from the consumer standpoint and lost from the utility standpoint with avoided cost a minimum compromise some regions allow optional payment for excess annual generation 23 which allows perpetual roll over or payment at the customers choice both wind and solar are inherently seasonal and it is highly likely to use up a surplus later unless more solar panels or a larger wind turbine have been installed than needed energy storageedit net metering systems can have energy storage integrated to store some of the power locally ie from the renewable energy source connected to the system rather than selling everything back to the mains electricity grid often the batteries used are industrial deep cycle batteries as these last for 10 to 20 years 24 lead-acid batteries are often also still used but last much less long  5 years or so lithium-ion batteries are sometimes also used but too have a relatively short lifespan finally nickel-iron batteries 25 last the longest with a lifespan of up to 40 years 26 27 28 australiaedit in some australian states the feed-in tariff is actually net metering except that it pays monthly for net generation at a higher rate than retail with environment victoria campaigns director mark wakeham calling it a fake feed-in tariff 29 a feed-in tariff requires a separate meter and pays for all local generation at a preferential rate while net metering requires only one meter the financial differences are very substantial in victoria from 2009 householders were paid 60 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid this was around three times the retail price for electricity at that time however subsequent state governments reduced the feed-in in several updates until in 2016 the feed-in is as low as 5 cents per kilowatt hour in queensland starting in 2008 the solar bonus scheme pays 44 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid this is around three times the current retail price for electricity however from 2012 the queensland feed in tariff has been reduced to 6-10 cents per kilowatt hour depending on which electricity retailer the customer has signed up with canadaedit ontario allows net metering for up to 500kw however credits can only be carried for 12 consecutive months should a consumer establish a credit where they generate more than they consume for 8 months and use up the credits in the 10th month then the 12-month period begins again from the date that the next credit is shown on an invoice any unused credits remaining at the end of 12 consecutive months of a consumer being in a credit situation are cleared at the end of that billing 30 areas of british columbia serviced by bc hydro are allowed net metering for up to 50kw at each annual anniversary the customer was paid 8.16 cents 31 per kwh if there is a net export of power after each 12-month period which was increased to 9.99 centskwh effective june 1 2012 systems over 50kw are covered under the standing offer program 32 33 fortisbc which serves an area in south central bc also allows net-metering for up to 50kw customers are paid their existing retail rate for any net energy they produce 34 the city of new westminster which has its own electrical utility does not currently allow net metering new brunswick allows net metering for installations up to 100kw credits from excess generated power can be carried over until march at which time any excess credits are lost  35 saskpower allows net metering for installations up to 100kw credits from excess generated power can be carried over until the customers annual anniversary date at which time any excess credits are lost european unionedit denmark established net-metering for privately owned pv systems in mid-1998 for a pilot-period of four years in 2002 the net-metering scheme was extended another four years up to end of 2006 net-metering has proved to be a cheap easy to administer and effective way of stimulating the deployment of pv in denmark however the relative short time window of the arrangement has so far prevented it from reaching its full potential during the political negotiations in the fall of 2005 the net-metering for privately owned pv systems was made permanent 36 the netherlands has net-metering since 2004 37 initially there was a limit of 3000kwh per year later this limit was increased to 5000kwh the limit was removed altogether on january 1 2014 38 italy offers a support scheme mixing net-metering and a well segmented premium fit 39 slovenia has annual net-metering since january 2016 for up to 11 kva in a calendar year up to 10 mva can be installed in the country 40 in 2010 spain net-metering has been proposed by the asociación de la industria fotovoltaica asif to promote renewable electricity without requiring additional economic support 41 but net-metering for privately owned systems is not yet established some form of net metering is now proposed by électricité de france according to their website energy produced by home-owners is bought at a higher price than what is charged as consumers hence some recommend to sell all energy produced and buy back all energy needed at a lower price the price has been fixed for 20 years by the government 42 43 united statesedit net metering was pioneered in the united states as a way to allow solar and wind to provide electricity whenever available and allow use of that electricity whenever it was needed beginning with utilities in idaho in 1980 and in arizona in 1981 5 in 1983 minnesota passed the first state net metering law 4 as of march 2015 44 states and washington dc have developed mandatory net metering rules for at least some utilities 44 net metering policies are determined by states which have set policies varying on a number of key dimensions the energy policy act of 2005 required state electricity regulators to consider but not necessarily implement rules that mandate public electric utilities make available upon request net metering to their customers 45 several legislative bills have been proposed to institute a federal standard limit on net metering they range from hr 729 which sets a net metering cap at 2 of forecasted aggregate customer peak demand to hr 1945 which has no aggregate cap but does limit residential users to 10kw a low limit compared to many states such as new mexico with an 80,000kw limit or states such as arizona colorado new jersey and ohio which limit as a percentage of load 46 arizona california colorado connecticut delaware maryland massachusetts new hampshire new jersey new york ohio oregon pennsylvania utah vermont and west virginia are considered the most favorable states for net metering as they are the only states to receive an a rating from freeing the grid in 2015 47 regulators in multiple states are acting as referees in debates between utility companies and advocates of distributed resources such as solar panel arrays in 2016 the national association of regulatory utility commissioners naruc published the manual on distributed energy resources compensation as a way to help states decide on rate structures dealing with homes and businesses that generate their own power and send excess power back to the electric grid the intention behind the manual is to provide a consistent framework for evaluating rate design decisions in the age of distributed energy resources 48 the president of naruc when he commissioned the manual said his instructions to the committee writing the manual were to write a practical expert and most importantly ideologically neutral guide that offers advice to states 48 the edison electric institute and the solar energy industries association both supported the manual however the main point of contention between utility companies and the solar industry is the question of whether distributed generation systems represent cost shift from those with the systems people with solar panels to those without them everyone else who uses electricity 48 phil moeller of the edison electric institute said we want to der distributed energy resources but we want to make sure the rate structure is right to minimize cost shifts 48 moeller is a former member of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc a federal government regulatory agency sean gallaher of the solar energy industries association said there seems to be an assumption that revenue erosion from der results in an inadequacy of cost recovery for the utility andtherefyor a shift of costs to non-participating customers you cant just assume that 48 note some additional minor variations not listed in this table

mountain energy is not a utility but a retail electric provider according to wwwpowertochoosecom 52 nevadaedit the state of nevada implemented net metering in 1997 53 up until 2016 utility companies in nevada paid the retail electricity rate to net metering consumers 54 nevadas utilities pay net metering customers an average of $623 per year in southern nevada and $471 per year in northern nevada 54 the major utility company in nevada is nv energy 53 55 the nevada legislature passed legislation in 2015 that required the nevada public utilities commission to study the electric rate structure and come up with ways to shift costs 56 in december 2015 the commission updated the regulations so that utility companies would pay the wholesale rate to net metering consumers 55 the group greenpeace and senator harry reid the democratic leader in the us senate expressed opposition to the commissions ruling 55 57 on february 8 2016 during a commission hearing three individuals with guns attempted to enter the hearing security guards turned them back the individuals said they would return to the next commission hearing and would be armed 58 ohioedit recently it has become a popular trend for utilities in several states to dramatically increase their consumers fixed charges in order to account for the cost-shift created by the growing number of net metering customers who do not cover their share of grid upkeep costs which subsequently places the burden onto non-solar panel customers the average increase of fixed charges is estimated at 20 percent in ohio american electric power aep proposed to more than double its fixed charges from $8.40 per month to $18.40 per month affecting nearly 1.5 million customers in order to accommodate for the increase costs due to net metering 59 aep was under investigation by the public utilities commission of ohio puco for allegedly double-charging their customers a total of $120 million to supposedly cover fuel costs for one of their power plants in lawerenceburg indiana and for two other power plants operated by ohio valley electric corp 60 the double-charge would have affected 67 percent or 1 million customers who had opted out of an alternate supplier in 2014 puco enlisted an outside firm to conduct an audit focusing on their consumers charges the findings concluded that the customers were indeed overpaying at the same time aep was being reimbursed for their fuel costs twice in a period from 2013-2015 the office of the ohio consumers council under the auditors advice requested aep to disclose additional records which was in turn denied by a puco administrative law judge who agreed with aeps stance that their confidentiality be protected until the audit process was resolved 60 pablo vegas the president and chief operating officer of aep ohio insisted at the time that rates are based on actual costs of system operations solidifying the companys claim that no deceptive action had taken place 60 maineedit in maine solar companies and major utility companies came to a legislative agreement in 2016 over net metering issues the two sides said that their deal might increase solar power in maine tenfold in five years 61 in response several national solar companies paid for lobbyists to travel to maine and attempt to persuade state legislators to stop the deal the legislation would replace net metering with a concept referred to as next metering under next metering regulators would set the rates that utilities pay residential solar customers for the customers excess energy under normal net metering utilities would pay the wholesale rate the legislation includes a grandfather clause for existing solar customers 61 missouriedit in the spring of 2016 the city of mt vernon missouri created a local net metering program the local board of aldermen passed a measure on may 16 2016 that allows for residents and businesses to apply to generate their own electricity while staying connected to the mt vernon power grid 62 the board took up the issue after city residents asked about regulations regarding hooking up their own solar panels the towns program would allow net metering but consumers must pay for their own equipment including a bi-directional meter participants would pay for power from the city at the regular rate that any other city consumer would pay participants who create excess power would receive a credit on their utility bill equal to what the city pays for the electricity at a wholesale rate from the distributor empire 62 indiaedit indian states of tamil nadu karnataka and andhra pradesh have started implementation of net metering and the policy has been announced by the respective state electricity boards in 2014 feasibility study will be done by the electricity boards and after inspection the meters will be replaced by bidirectional ones and will be installed applications are taken up for up to 30 of the distribution transformer capacity on a first-come first-served basis and technical feasibility 63 net purchase and saleedit net purchase and sale is a different method of providing power to the electricity grid that does not offer the price symmetry of net metering making this system a lot less profitable for home users of small renewable electricity systems under this arrangement two uni-directional meters are installedone records electricity drawn from the grid and the other records excess electricity generated and fed back into the grid the user pays retail rate for the electricity they use and the power provider purchases their excess generation at its avoided cost wholesale rate there may be a significant difference between the retail rate the user pays and the power providers avoided cost 64 germany spain ontario canada some states in the usa and other countries on the other hand have adopted a price schedule or feed-in tariff fit whereby customers get paid for any electricity they generate from renewable energy on their premises the actual electricity being generated is counted on a separate meter not just the surplus they feed back to the grid in germany for the solar power generated a feed-in tariff is being paid in order to boost solar power figure from 2009 germany once paid several times the retail rate for solar but has successfully reduced the rates drastically while actual installation of solar has grown exponentially at the same time due to installed cost reductions wind energy in contrast only receives around a half of the domestic retail rate because the german system pays what each source costs including a reasonable profit margin related technologyedit sources that produce direct current such as solar panels must be coupled with an electrical inverter to convert the output to alternating current for use with conventional appliances the phase of the outgoing power must be synchronized with the grid and a mechanism must be included to disconnect the feed in the event of grid failure this is for safety for example workers repairing downed power lines must be protected from downstream sources in addition to being disconnected from the main upstream distribution grid note a small generator simply lacks the power to energize a loaded line this can only happen if the line is isolated from other loads and is extremely unlikely solar inverters are designed for safety while one inverter could not energize a line a thousand might in addition all electrical workers should treat every line as though it was live even when they know it should be safe 65 66 solar guerrillaedit solar guerrilla or the guerrilla solar movement is a term originated by home power magazine and is applied to someone who connects solar panels without permission or notification and uses monthly net
