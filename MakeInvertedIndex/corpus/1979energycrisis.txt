1979 energy crisis the 1979 or second oil crisis or oil shock occurred in the united states due to decreased oil output in the wake of the iranian revolution despite the fact that global oil supply decreased by only ~4 widespread panic resulted driving the price far higher than justified by supply the price of crude oil more than doubled to $39.50 per barrel over the next 12 months and long lines once again appeared at gas stations as they had in the 1973 oil crisis 2 in 1980 following the outbreak of the iraniraq war oil production in iran nearly stopped and iraqs oil production was severely cut as well economic recessions were triggered in the us and other countries oil prices did not subside to pre-crisis levels until the mid-1980s after 1980 oil prices began a 20-year decline eventually reaching a 60 percent fall-off during the 1990s as with the 1973 crisis global politics and power balance were impacted oil exporters such as mexico nigeria and venezuela expanded production the ussr became the top world producer north sea and alaskan oil flooded the market and opec lost influence  contents 1 iran 2 effects 2.1 other opec members 2.2 united states 2.3 other

iranedit amid massive protests the shah of iran mohammad reza pahlavi fled his country in early 1979 and the ayatollah khomeini soon became the new leader of iran protests severely disrupted the iranian oil sector with production being greatly curtailed and exports suspended in november 1978 a strike by 37,000 workers at irans nationalized oil refineries initially reduced production from 6 million barrels  950,000m3 per day to about 1.5 million barrels  240,000m3 3 foreign workers including skilled oil workers fled the country on january 16 1979 the shah and his wife left iran at the behest of prime minister shapour bakhtiar a longtime opposition leader himself who sought to calm the situation 4 effectsedit other opec membersedit the rise in oil price benefited other opec members which made record profits when oil exports were later resumed under the new iranian government they were inconsistent and at a lower volume pushing prices up saudi arabia and other opec nations under the presidency of mana al otaiba increased production to offset most of the decline and in early 1979 the overall loss in worldwide production was about 4 percent 7 opec failed to hold on to its preeminent position especially after iran and iraq went to war in 1980 and caused a further 10 drop in worldwide production  and by 1981 opec production was surpassed by other exporters additionally its own member nations were divided among themselves saudi arabia a swing producer trying to gain back market share after 1985 increased production and caused downward pressure on prices making high-cost oil production facilities less profitable or even unprofitable united statesedit the oil crisis had mixed effects in the united states due to some parts of the country being oil-producing regions and other parts being oil-consuming regions richard nixon had imposed price controls on domestic oil gasoline controls were repealed but controls on domestic us oil remained the jimmy carter administration began a phased deregulation of oil prices on april 5 1979 when the average price of crude oil was us$15.85 per barrel  42 us gallons  160l starting with the iranian revolution the price of crude oil rose to $39.50 per barrel over the next 12 months its all-time highest real price until march 3 2008 8 deregulating domestic oil price controls allowed us oil output to rise sharply from the large prudhoe bay fields while oil imports fell sharply and although not directly related the near-disaster at three mile island on march 28 1979 also increased anxiety about energy policy and availability 9 due to memories of oil shortage in 1973 motorists soon began panic buying and long lines appeared at gas stations as they had six years earlier during the 1973 oil crisis 10 as the average vehicle of the time consumed between two and three liters about 0.5-0.8 gallons of gasoline petrol an hour while idling it was estimated that americans wasted up to 150,000 barrels  24,000m3 of oil per day idling their engines in the lines at gas stations 11 during the period many people believed the oil companies artificially created oil shortages to drive up prices rather than factors beyond human control or the us own price controls the amount of oil sold in the united states in 1979 was only 3.5 percent less than the record set for oil sold the year previously 12 a telephone poll of 1,600 american adults conducted by the associated press and nbc news and released in early may 1979 found that only 37 of americans thought the energy shortages were real 9 were not sure and 54 thought the energy shortages were a hoax 13 many politicians proposed gas rationing one such proponent was harry hughes governor of maryland who proposed odd-even rationing only people with an odd-numbered license plate could purchase gas on an odd-numbered day as was used during the 1973 oil crisis several states actually implemented odd-even gas rationing including california pennsylvania new york new jersey oregon and texas coupons for gasoline rationing were printed but were never actually used during the 1979 crisis 14 on july 15 1979 president carter outlined his plans to reduce oil imports and improve energy efficiency in his crisis of confidence speech sometimes known as the malaise speech 15 it is often said that during the speech carter wore a cardigan he actually wore a blue suit  16 and encouraged citizens to do what they could to reduce their use of energy he had already installed solar hot water panels on the roof of the white house and a wood-burning stove in the living quarters however the panels were removed in 1986 reportedly for roof maintenance during the administration of his successor ronald reagan 17 carters speech argued the oil crisis was the moral equivalent of war critics then and now argued that his varied proposals would make the situation worse not better 18 several months later in january 1980 carter issued the carter doctrine which declared that any interference with us oil interests in the persian gulf would be considered an attack on the vital interests of the united states 19 additionally as part of his administrations efforts at deregulation carter proposed removing price controls that had been imposed by the administration of richard nixon before the 1973 crisis carter agreed to remove price controls in phases they were finally dismantled in 1981 under reagan 20 carter also said he would impose a windfall profit tax on oil companies 21 while the regulated price of domestic oil was kept to $6 a barrel the world market price was $30 21 in 1980 the us government established the synthetic fuels corporation to produce an alternative to imported fossil fuels when the price of west texas intermediate crude oil increased 250 percent between 1978 and 1980 the oil-producing areas of texas oklahoma louisiana colorado wyoming and alaska began experiencing an economic boom and population inflows 22 other oil-consuming nationsedit in response to the high oil prices of the 1970s industrial nations took steps to reduce their dependence on opec oil 8 electric utilities worldwide switched from oil to coal natural gas or nuclear power 23 national governments initiated multibillion-dollar research programs to develop alternatives to oil 24 25 and commercial exploration developed major non-opec oilfields in siberia alaska north sea and gulf of mexico 26 by 1986 daily worldwide demand for oil dropped by 5million barrels non-opec production rose by an even-larger amount 27 and opecs market share sank from 50 in 1979 to just 29 in 1985 28 automobile fuel economyedit at the time detroits big three automakers ford chrysler gm were marketing downsized full-sized automobiles like the chevrolet caprice the ford ltd crown victoria and the dodge st regis which met the cafe fuel economy mandates passed in 1978 detroits response to the growing popularity of imported compacts like the toyota corolla and the volkswagen rabbit were the chevrolet citation and the ford fairmont ford replaced the ford pinto with the ford escort and chrysler on the verge of bankruptcy introduced the dodge aries k gm was having unfavorable market reactions to the citation and introduced the chevrolet corsica and chevrolet beretta in 1987 which did sell better gm also replaced the chevrolet monza introducing the 1982 chevrolet cavalier which was better received ford experienced a similar market rejection of the fairmont and introduced the front wheel drive ford tempo in 1984 checker motors known for its iconic marathon sedans used for the taxicab livery ceased its automotive production in 1982 transitioning to stamping sheetmetal for gm american motors the final independent manufacturer outside of detroits big three entered into a joint venture with renault where its mass market automobiles were sold alongside the remaining amc product lineup which have declined in sales while amcs jeep division was profiting especially with the introduction of its downsized xj sport utilities which led to the companys demise its homegrown compacts dating back to 1970 - they were phased out in 1983 with the exception of the eagle 4wd wagon making it the final amc designed product and financial woes with the renault partnership ended the reign of the final independent - renault ended up owning 100 of amc in 1982 resulting in the divestment of am general until late 1986 where they sold amcs shares to chrysler corporation - they later absorbed amc in late 1987 where the jeep division is now part of chrysler now fca automobiles detroit was not well prepared for the sudden rise in fuel prices and imported brands primarily the asian marques which were mass marketed and had a lower manufacturing cost as opposed to british and west german brands - the rising value of the deutsche mark and english pound resulted in the transition to the rise of japanese manufacturers where exporting their product from japan at a lower cost would yield profitable gains despite accusations of price dumping were now more widely available in north america and had developed a loyal customer base - the japanese big three launched their respective advertisement campaigns honda with its we make it simple tagline datsun nissan after 1984 with the tagline we are driven and toyota with oh what a feeling they ran a previous ad campaign prior to 1979 where the company mocked the plymouth volare with the tagline you asked for it - you got it - luring away traditional big three consumers subaru in the late 1970s ran an ad campaign where former owners of a big three automobile drove their products - one tv ad started with the tagline ford drives subaru a year after the 1979 iranian revolution japanese manufacturers surpassed detroits production totals becoming first in the world japanese exports would later displace the automotive market once dominated by lowered tier european manufacturers alfa romeo fiat opel peugeot mg triumph citroen - some would declare bankruptcy eg triumph simca or withdraw from the us market especially in the wake of grey market automobiles or the inability of the vehicle to meet dot requirements from emission requirements to automotive lighting many imported brands utilized fuel saving technologies such as fuel injection and multi-valve engines over the common use of carburetors also the imported brands used their innovative business ethic eg a just-in-time inventory system but the us government imposed import quotas where the japanese brands later extended to south korean and european marques began outsourcing their operations by opening assembly plants in the united states especially the southern us where import automakers were not on friendly terms with labor unions from the rust belt states canada and mexico to produce their mass market automobiles and light trucks import brands also complied with local content laws where an import automobile must have a percentage of automotive components in the united states automobiles with 70 percent local content manufacture is considered a domestic build regardless of manufacturer sourced from the united states canada or mexico prior to the establishment of nafta and the american automobile labeling act of 1994 which mandated the percentage of automotive parts content printed on the monroney sticker of an automobile sold through a dealership the import quota resulted in the japanese automakers importing a limited amount of automobiles but to comply with the us government imposition of the 1981 voluntary export restraints the automakers established their respective luxury marques acura lexus infiniti but run respectively by their parent manufacturers honda toyota nissan gms cadillac division experimented with their v8-6-4 power plant the ancestor of the modern-day active fuel management andor variable displacement which was a market failure 29 nonetheless overall fuel economy increased which was one factor leading to the subsequent 1980s oil glut see alsoedit energy portal energy crisis iran hostage crisis 1979 world oil market
