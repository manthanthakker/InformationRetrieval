steam engine a steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid steam engines are external combustion engines 1 where the working fluid is separate from the combustion products non-combustion heat sources such as solar power nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used the ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the rankine cycle in the cycle water is heated and transforms into steam within a boiler operating at a high pressure when expanded through pistons or turbines mechanical work is done the reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler in general usage the term steam engine can refer to either the integrated steam plants including boilers etc such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine specialized devices such as steam hammers and steam pile drivers are dependent on the steam pressure supplied from a separate boiler the use of boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back over 2000 years but early devices were not highly practical the spanish inventor jerónimo de ayanz y beaumont obtained the first patent for a steam engine in 1606 2 in 1698 thomas savery patented a steam pump that used steam in direct contact with the water being pumped saverys steam pump used condensing steam to create a vacuum and draw water into a chamber and then applied pressurized steam to further pump the water thomas newcomens atmospheric engine was the first commercial true steam engine using a piston and was used in 1712 for pumping in a mine in 1781 james watt patented a steam engine that produced continuous rotary motion 3 watts ten-horsepower engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery to be powered the engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood fuel could be obtained by 1883 engines that could provide 10,000hp had become feasible 4 the stationary steam engine was a key component of the industrial revolution allowing factories to locate where water power was unavailable the atmospheric engines of newcomen and watt were large compared to the amount of power they produced but high pressure steam engines were light enough to be applied to vehicles such as traction engines and the railway locomotives reciprocating piston type steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating piston steam engines in commercial usage and the ascendancy of steam turbines in power generation 5 considering that the great majority of worldwide electric generation is produced by turbine type steam engines the steam age is continuing with energy levels far beyond those of the turn of the 19th century  contents 1 history 1.1 early designs and

type  historyedit early designs and modificationsedit the aeolipile also known as a hero engine described by hero of alexandria in the 1st century ad is considered to be the first recorded steam engine torque was produced by steam jets exiting the turbine thomas savery in 1698 patented the first practical atmospheric pressure steam engine of 1 horsepower  750w it had no piston or moving parts only taps it was a fire engine a kind of thermic syphon in which steam was admitted to an empty container and then condensed the vacuum thus created was used to suck water from the sump at the bottom of the mine the fire engine was not very effective and could not work beyond a limited depth of around 30 feet  9.1m thomas newcomen in 1712 developed the first commercially successful piston steam engine of 5 horsepower  3,700w its principle was to condense steam in a cylinder thus causing atmospheric pressure to drive a piston and produce mechanical work james watt in 1781 patented a steam engine that produced continued rotary motion with a power of about 10 horsepower  7,500w it was the first type of steam engine to make use of steam at a pressure just above atmospheric to drive the piston helped by a partial vacuum it was an improvement of newcomens engine richard trevithick it was only after the invention of the lightweight high pressure steam engine by richard trevithick in 1797-1799 that steam engines became small enough to be used in smaller businesses and for use in steam locomotives since the early 18th century steam power has been applied to a variety of practical uses at first it powered reciprocating pumps but from the 1780s rotative engines those converting reciprocating motion into rotary motion began to appear driving factory machinery such as spinning mules and power looms at the turn of the 19th century steam-powered transport on both sea and land began to make its appearance becoming more dominant as the century progressed steam engines can be said to have been the moving force behind the industrial revolution and saw widespread commercial use driving machinery in factories mills and mines powering pumping stations and propelling transport appliances such as railway locomotives ships steamboats and road vehicles their use in agriculture led to an increase in the land available for cultivation there have at one time or another been steam-powered farm tractors motorcycles without much success and even automobiles as the stanley steamer 6 the weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines 7 for mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors however most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant so that indirectly the worlds industry is still dependent on steam power recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover this is becoming known as the advanced steam movementcitation needed early experimentsedit the history of the steam engine stretches back as far as the first century ad the first recorded rudimentary steam engine being the aeolipile described by greek mathematician hero of alexandria 8 in the following centuries the few steam-powered engines known were like the aeolipile 9 essentially experimental devices used by inventors to demonstrate the properties of steam a rudimentary steam turbine device was described by taqi al-din 10 in 1551 and by giovanni branca 11 in 1629 12 jerónimo de ayanz y beaumont received patents in 1606 for fifty steam powered inventions including a water pump for draining inundated mines 13 denis papin a huguenot refugee did some useful work on the steam digester in 1679 and first used a piston to raise weights in 1690 14 pumping enginesedit the first commercial steam-powered device was a water pump developed in 1698 by thomas savery 15 it used condensing steam to create a vacuum which was used to raise water from below then it used steam pressure to raise it higher small engines were effective though larger models were problematic they proved only to have a limited lift height and were prone to boiler explosions it received some use in mines pumping stations and for supplying water wheels used to power textile machinery 16 an attractive feature of the savery engine was its low cost bento de moura portugal introduced an ingenious improvement of saverys construction to render it capable of working itself as described by john smeaton in the philosophical transactions published in 1751 17 it continued to be manufactured until the late 18th century 18 one engine was still known to be operating in 1820 19 piston steam enginesedit the first commercially successful true engine in that it could generate power and transmit it to a machine was the atmospheric engine invented by thomas newcomen around 1712 20 21 it was an improvement over saverys steam pump using a piston as proposed by papin newcomens engine was relatively inefficient and in most cases was used for pumping water it worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder it was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable head water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel 22 in 1720 jacob leupold described a two-cylinder high-pressure steam engine 23 the invention was published in his major work theatri machinarum hydraulicarum 24 the engine used two heavy pistons to provide motion to a water pump each piston was raised by the steam pressure and returned to its original position by gravity the two pistons shared a common four way rotary valve connected directly to a steam boiler the next major step occurred when james watt developed  1763–1775 an improved version of newcomens engine with a separate condenser boulton and watts early engines used half as much coal as john smeatons improved version of newcomens 25 newcomens and watts early engines were atmospheric they were powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam instead of the pressure of expanding steam the engine cylinders had to be large because the only usable force acting on them was due to atmospheric pressure 22 26 watt proceeded to develop his engine further modifying it to provide a rotary motion suitable for driving factory machinery this enabled factories to be sited away from rivers and further accelerated the pace of the industrial revolution 26 27 28 high-pressure enginesedit watts patent prevented others from making high pressure and compound engines shortly after watts patent expired in 1800 richard trevithick and separately oliver evans in 1801 28 29 introduced engines using high-pressure steam trevithick obtained his high-pressure engine patent in 1802 30 and evans had made several working models before then 31 these were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications thereafter technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques partly brought about by the adoption of the steam engine as a power source resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller faster or more powerful depending on the intended application 22 the cornish engine was developed by trevithick and others in the 1810s 32 it was a compound cycle engine that used high-pressure steam expansively then condensed the low-pressure steam making it relatively efficient the cornish engine had irregular motion and torque though the cycle limiting it mainly to pumping cornish engines were used in mines and for water supply until the late 19th century 33 horizontal stationary engineedit early builders of stationary steam engines considered that horizontal cylinders would be subject to excessive wear their engines were therefore arranged with the piston axis vertical in time the horizontal arrangement became more popular allowing compact but powerful engines to be fitted in smaller spaces the acme of the horizontal engine was the corliss steam engine patented in 1849 which was a four-valve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff when corliss was given the rumford medal the committee said that no one invention since watts time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine 34 in addition to using 30 less steam it provided more uniform speed due to variable steam cut off making it well suited to manufacturing especially cotton spinning 22 28 road vehiclesedit the first experimental road going steam powered vehicles were built in the late 18th century but it was not until after richard trevithick had developed the use of high-pressure steam around 1800 that mobile steam engines became a practical proposition the first half of the 19th century saw great progress in steam vehicle design and by the 1850s it was becoming viable to produce them on a commercial basis this progress was dampened by legislation which limited or prohibited the use of steam powered vehicles on roads improvements in vehicle technology continued from the 1860s to the 1920s steam road vehicles were used for many applications in the 20th century the rapid development of internal combustion engine technology led to the demise of the steam engine as a source of propulsion of vehicles on a commercial basis with relatively few remaining in use beyond the second world war many of these vehicles were acquired by enthusiasts for preservation and numerous examples are still in existence in the 1960s the air pollution problems in california gave rise to a brief period of interest in developing and studying steam powered vehicles as a possible means of reducing the pollution apart from interest by steam enthusiasts the occasional replica vehicle and experimental technology no steam vehicles are in production at present marine enginesedit near the end of the 19th century compound engines came into widespread use compound engines exhausted steam in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures giving improved efficiency these stages were called expansions with double and triple expansion engines being common especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried 22 steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating piston steam engines with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine 5 steam locomotivesedit as the development of steam engines progressed through the 18th century various attempts were made to apply them to road and railway use 35 in 1784 william murdoch a scottish inventor built a prototype steam road locomotive 36 an early working model of a steam rail locomotive was designed and constructed by steamboat pioneer john fitch in the united states probably during the 1780s or 1790s 37 his steam locomotive used interior bladed wheels guided by rails or tracks the first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was built by richard trevithick in the united kingdom and on 21 february 1804 the worlds first railway journey took place as trevithicks unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway from the pen-y-darren ironworks near merthyr tydfil to abercynon in south wales 35 38 39 the design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency trevithick visited the newcastle area later in 1804 and the colliery railways in north-east england became the leading centre for experimentation and development of steam locomotives 40 trevithick continued his own experiments using a trio of locomotives concluding with the catch me who can in 1808 only four years later the successful twin-cylinder locomotive salamanca by matthew murray was used by the edge railed rack and pinion middleton railway 41 in 1825 george stephenson built the locomotion for the stockton and darlington railway this was the first public steam railway in the world and then in 1829 he built the rocket which was entered in and won the rainhill trials 42 the liverpool and manchester railway opened in 1830 making exclusive use of steam power for both passenger and freight trains steam locomotives continued to be manufactured until the late twentieth century in places such as china and the former east germany where the dr class 52.80 was produced 43 steam turbinesedit the final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam turbines starting in the late part of the 19th century steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines for outputs above several hundred horsepower have fewer moving parts and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means 44 steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century where their efficiency higher speed appropriate to generator service and smooth rotation were advantages today most electric power is provided by steam turbines in the united states 90 of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources 5 steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century present developmentedit although the reciprocating steam engine is no longer in widespread commercial use various companies are exploring or exploiting the potential of the engine as an alternative to internal combustion engines the company energiprojekt ab in sweden has made progress in using modern materials for harnessing the power of steam the efficiency of energiprojekts steam engine reaches some 27-30 on high-pressure engines it is a single-step 5-cylinder engine no compound with superheated steam and consumes approx 4kg  8.8lb of steam per kwh 45not in citation given components and accessories of steam enginesedit there are two fundamental components of a steam plant the boiler or steam generator and the motor unit referred to itself as a steam engine stationary steam engines in fixed buildings may have the boiler and engine in separate buildings some distance apart for portable or mobile use such as steam locomotives the two are mounted together 46 47 the widely used reciprocating engine typically consisted of a cast iron cylinder piston connecting rod and beam or a crank and flywheel and miscellaneous linkages steam was alternately supplied and exhausted by one or more valves speed control was either automatic using a governor or by a manual valve the cylinder casting contained steam supply and exhaust ports engines equipped with a condenser are a separate type than those that exhaust to the atmosphere other components are often present pumps such as an injector to supply water to the boiler during operation condensers to recirculate the water and recover the latent heat of vaporisation and superheaters to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapour point and various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes when coal is used a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor may be included to move the fuel from a supply bin bunker to the firebox 48 see mechanical stoker heat sourceedit the heat required for boiling the water and supplying the steam can be derived from various sources most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space called variously combustion chamber firebox in some cases the heat source is a nuclear reactor geothermal energy solar energy or waste heat from an internal combustion engine or industrial process in the case of model or toy steam engines the heat source can be an electric heating element boilersedit boilers are pressure vessels that contain water to be boiled and some kind of mechanism for transferring the heat to the water so as to boil it 49 the two most common methods of transferring heat to the water are fire tube boilers were the main type used for early high-pressure steam typical steam locomotive practice but they were to a large extent displaced by more economical water tube boilers in the late 19th century for marine propulsion and large stationary applications once turned to steam many boilers raise the temperature of the steam further turning wet steam into superheated steam this use of superheating avoids the steam condensing within the engine and allows significantly greater efficiency 50 motor unitsedit in a steam engine a piston or steam turbine or any other similar device for doing mechanical work takes a supply of steam at high pressure and temperature and gives out a supply of steam at lower pressure and temperature using as much of the difference in steam energy as possible to do mechanical work these motor units are often called steam engines in their own right they will also operate on compressed air or other gas cold sinkedit as with all heat engines the majority of primary energy must be emitted as waste heat at relatively low temperature 51 the simplest cold sink is to vent the steam to the environment this is often used on steam locomotives as the released steam is vented up the chimney so as to increase the draw on the fire which greatly increases engine power but reduces efficiency sometimes the waste heat is useful itself and in those cases very high overall efficiency can be obtained for example combined heat and power chp systems use the waste steam for district heating exceeding 80 combined efficiency 51 where chp is not used steam turbines in stationary power plants use surface condensers as a cold sink the condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans rivers lakes and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal the resulting condensed hot water is then pumped back up to pressure and sent back to the boiler a dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly waste heat can also be ejected by evaporative wet cooling towers use pass the rejected to external water cycle that evaporates some of flow to the airclarification needed cooling towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than once-through cooling by river or lake water a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water 52 53 evaporative water cannot be used for subsequent purposes other than rain somewhere whereas river water can be re-used in all cases the steam plant water which must be kept pure is kept separate from the cooling water or air and once the low pressure steam condenses into water it is returned to the boiler water pumpedit the rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water so that they may be run continuously utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage centrifugal pumps however other types are used another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an injector which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler injectors became popular in the 1850s but are no longer widely used except in applications such as steam locomotives 54 it is the pressurization of the water that circulates through the steam boiler that allows the water to be raised to temperatures well above 100 c boiling point of water at one atmospheric pressure and by that means to increase the efficiency of the steam cycle monitoring and controledit for safety reasons nearly all steam engines are equipped with mechanisms to monitor the boiler such as a pressure gauge and a sight glass to monitor the water level many engines stationary and mobile are also fitted with a governor to regulate the speed of the engine without the need for human interference the most useful instrument for analyzing the performance of steam engines is the steam engine indicator early versions were in use by 1851 55 but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer charles porter by charles richard and exhibited at london exhibition in 1862 28 the steam engine indicator traces on paper the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle which can be used to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower 56 it was routinely used by engineers mechanics and insurance inspectors the engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines see image of indicator diagram below in types of motor units section governoredit the centrifugal governor was adopted by james watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after watts partner boulton saw one on the equipment of a flour mill boulton  watt were building 57 the governor could not actually hold a set speed because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes the governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler also there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change as a consequence engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed such as cotton spinning 58 the governor was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century engine configurationedit  simple engineedit in a simple engine the charge of steam passes through only one cylinder 59 it is then exhausted directly into the atmosphere or into a condenser as steam expands in passing through a high-pressure engine its temperature drops because no heat is being added to the system this is known as adiabatic expansion and results in steam entering the cylinder at high temperature and leaving at lower temperature this causes a cycle of heating and cooling of the cylinder with every stroke which is a source of inefficiency 60 as the stroke of a single cylinder engine is increased in an effort to extract more work from the steam with each stroke a greater amount of cylinder wall is exposed and more heat is lost resulting in decreased efficiency of a long stroke engine compound enginesedit a method to lessen the magnitude of energy loss to a very long cylinder was invented in 1804 by british engineer arthur woolf who patented his woolf high-pressure compound engine in 1805 in the compound engine high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure hp cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure lp cylinders the complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less cylinder wall is exposed per unit volume of steam in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each this reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling increasing the efficiency of the engine by staging the expansion in multiple cylinders variations of torque can be reduced 22 to derive equal work from lower-pressure cylinder requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume therefore the bore and often the stroke are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders 22 double expansion usually known as compound engines expanded the steam in two stages the pairs may be duplicated or the work of the large low-pressure cylinder can be split with one high-pressure cylinder exhausting into one or the other giving a three-cylinder layout where cylinder and piston diameter are about the same making the reciprocating masses easier to balance 22 two-cylinder compounds can be arranged as cross compounds the cylinders are side by side tandem compounds the cylinders are end to end driving a common connecting rod angle compounds the cylinders are arranged in a v usually at a 90 angle and drive a common crank with two-cylinder compounds used in railway work the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90 out of phase with each other quartered when the double expansion group is duplicated producing a four-cylinder compound the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180 the groups being set at 90 to each other in one case the first type of vauclain compound the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common crosshead and crank again set at 90 as for a two-cylinder engine with the three-cylinder compound arrangement the lp cranks were either set at 90 with the hp one at 135 to the other two or in some cases all three cranks were set at 120citation needed the adoption of compounding was common for industrial units for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880 it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated this is partly due to the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the loading gauge particularly in britain where compounding was never common and not employed after 1930 however although never in the majority it was popular in many other countries 61 multiple expansion enginesedit  it is a logical extension of the compound engine described above to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency the result is the multiple expansion engine such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively these engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter these cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage as with the double expansion engine if space is at a premium then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline but various other formations were used in the late 19th century the yarrow-schlick-tweedy balancing system was used on some marine triple expansion engines y-s-t engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders one at each end of the engine this allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced resulting in a smoother faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration this made the four-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners such as the olympic class but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free turbine enginecitation needed the image to the right shows an animation of a triple expansion engine the steam travels through the engine from left to right the valve chest for each of the cylinders is to the left of the corresponding cylinder land-based steam engines could exhaust much of their steam as feed water was usually readily available prior to and during world war i the expansion engine dominated marine applications where high vessel speed was not essential it was however superseded by the british invention steam turbine where speed was required for instance in warships such as the dreadnought battleships and ocean liners hmsdreadnought of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbinecitation needed 62 types of motor unitsedit reciprocating pistonedit in most reciprocating piston engines the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke counterflow entering and exhausting from the cylinder by the same port the complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes the cycle also comprises four events  admission expansion exhaust compression these events are controlled by valves often working inside a steam chest adjacent to the cylinder the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ports communicating with the cylinder ends and are driven by valve gear of which there are many typescitation needed the simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually shortening the cutoff or rather shortening the admission event this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period however as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant if the exhaust event is too brief the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder choking it and giving excessive compression kick backcitation needed in the 1840s and 50s there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate variable cutoff expansion valve riding on the back of the main slide valve the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff the combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events at the expense of increased friction and wear and the mechanism tended to be complicated the usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred this expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler stephenson joy and walschaerts motions corliss and later poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms 61 63 before the exhaust phase is quite complete the exhaust side of the valve closes shutting a portion of the exhaust steam inside the cylinder this determines the compression phase where a cushion of steam is formed against which the piston does work whilst its velocity is rapidly decreasing it moreover obviates the pressure and temperature shock which would otherwise be caused by the sudden admission of the high-pressure steam at the beginning of the following cyclecitation needed the above effects are further enhanced by providing lead as was later discovered with the internal combustion engine it has been found advantageous since the late 1830s to advance the admission phase giving the valve lead so that admission occurs a little before the end of the exhaust stroke in order to fill the clearance volume comprising the ports and the cylinder ends not part of the piston-swept volume before the steam begins to exert effort on the piston 64 uniflow or unaflow engineedit uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle where during each stroke the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy in restoring working temperature the aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction by this means the simple-expansion uniflow engine gives efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems with the added advantage of superior part-load performance and comparable efficiency to turbines for smaller engines below one thousand horsepower however the thermal expansion gradient uniflow engines produce along the cylinder wall gives practical difficultiescitation needed the quasiturbine is a uniflow rotary steam engine where steam intakes in hot areas while exhausting in cold areas turbine enginesedit a steam turbine consists of one or more rotors rotating discs mounted on a drive shaft alternating with a series of stators static discs fixed to the turbine casing the rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge steam acts upon these blades producing rotary motion the stator consists of a similar but fixed series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage a steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum the stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications such as a ships propeller in the vast majority of large electric generating stations turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute rpm in the usa with 60 hertz power and 3000 rpm in europe and other countries with 50 hertz electric power systems in nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds 1800 rpm and 1500 rpm a turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction therefore a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction steam turbines provide direct rotational force and therefore do not require a linkage mechanism to convert reciprocating to rotary motion thus they produce smoother rotational forces on the output shaft this contributes to a lower maintenance requirement and less wear on the machinery they power than a comparable reciprocating enginecitation needed the main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation in the 1990s about 90 of the worlds electric production was by use of steam turbines 5 however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80 regime for steam turbines in electricity production the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines in marine service pioneered on the turbinia steam turbines with reduction gearing although the turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century being more efficient and requiring far less maintenance than reciprocating steam engines in recent decades reciprocating diesel engines and gas turbines have almost entirely supplanted steam propulsion for marine applications virtually all nuclear power plants generate electricity by heating water to provide steam that drives a turbine connected to an electrical generator nuclear-powered ships and submarines either use a steam turbine directly for main propulsion with generators providing auxiliary power or else employ turbo-electric transmission where the steam drives a turbo generator set with propulsion provided by electric motors a limited number of steam turbine railroad locomotives were manufactured some non-condensing direct-drive locomotives did meet with some success for long haul freight operations in sweden and for express passenger work in britain but were not repeated elsewhere notably in the usa more advanced designs with electric transmission were built experimentally but not reproduced it was found that steam turbines were not ideally suited to the railroad environment and these locomotives failed to oust the classic reciprocating steam unit in the way that modern diesel and electric traction has donecitation needed oscillating cylinder steam enginesedit an oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam into and out of the cylinder instead of valves the entire cylinder rocks or oscillates such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting trunnion these engines are mainly used in toys and models because of their simplicity but have also been used in full size working engines mainly on ships where their compactness is valuedcitation needed rotary steam enginesedit it is possible to use a mechanism based on a pistonless rotary engine such as the wankel engine in place of the cylinders and valve gear of a conventional reciprocating steam engine many such engines have been designed from the time of james watt to the present day but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production see link at bottom of article for more details the major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steam-tight in the face of wear and thermal expansion the resulting leakage made them very inefficient lack of expansive working or any means of control of the cutoff is also a serious problem with many such designscitation needed by the 1840s it was clear that the concept had inherent problems and rotary engines were treated with some derision in the technical press however the arrival of electricity on the scene and the obvious advantages of driving a dynamo directly from a high-speed engine led to something of a revival in interest in the 1880s and 1890s and a few designs had some limited successcitation needed the quasiturbine is a new type of uniflow rotary steam engine of the few designs that were manufactured in quantity those of the hult brothers rotary steam engine company of stockholm sweden and the spherical engine of beauchamp tower are notable towers engines were used by the great eastern railway to drive lighting dynamos on their locomotives and by the admiralty for driving dynamos on board the ships of the royal navy they were eventually replaced in these niche applications by steam turbinescitation needed rocket typeedit the aeolipile represents the use of steam by the rocket-reaction principle although not for direct propulsion in more modern times there has been limited use of steam for rocketry  particularly for rocket cars steam rocketry works by filling a pressure vessel with hot water at high pressure and opening a valve leading to a suitable nozzle the drop in pressure immediately boils some of the water and the steam leaves through a nozzle creating a propulsive force 65 safetyedit steam engines possess boilers and other components that are pressure vessels that contain a great deal of potential energy steam escapes and boiler explosions typically bleves can and have in the past caused great loss of life while variations in standards may exist in different countries stringent legal testing training care with manufacture operation and certification is applied to ensure safety failure modes may include over-pressurisation of the boiler insufficient water in the boiler causing overheating and vessel failure buildup of sediment and scale which cause local hot spots especially in riverboats using dirty feed water pressure vessel failure of the boiler due to inadequate construction or maintenance escape of steam from pipeworkboiler causing scalding steam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high one may be adjusted by the user the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler one end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine the more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken this arrangement is considerably safercitation needed lead fusible plugs may be present in the crown of the boilers firebox if the water level drops such that the temperature of the firebox crown increases significantly the lead melts and the steam escapes warning the operators who may then manually suppress the fire except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire the plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly depressurizing the boiler if they were any larger the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crewcitation needed steam cycleedit the rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine the cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production and utilizes the phase change of water boiling water producing steam condensing exhaust steam producing liquid water to provide a practical heatpower conversion system the heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser the rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications in the 1990s rankine steam cycles generated about 90 of all electric power used throughout the world including virtually all solar biomass coal and nuclear power plants it is named after william john macquorn rankine a scottish polymath the rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical carnot cycle because when an efficient turbine is used the ts diagram begins to resemble the carnot cycle the main difference is that heat addition in the boiler and rejection in the condenser are isobaric constant pressure processes in the rankine cycle and isothermal constant temperature processes in the theoretical carnot cycle in this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor as in the carnot cycle the cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages 66 the working fluid in a rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system where the working fluid is recycled continuously or may be an open loop system where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is supplied normally water is the fluid of choice due to its favourable properties such as non-toxic and unreactive chemistry abundance low cost and its thermodynamic properties mercury is the working fluid in the mercury vapor turbine low boiling hydrocarbons can be used in a binary cycle the steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory however the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam the experimental measurements made by watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser watt independently discovered latent heat which was confirmed by the original discoverer joseph black who also advised watt on experimental procedures watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure otherwise the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature 18 the thermodynamic concepts of the rankine cycle did give engineers the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine efficiencyedit the efficiency of an engine can be calculated by dividing the energy output of mechanical work that the engine produces by the energy input to the engine by the burning fuel the historical measure of a steam engines energy efficiency was its duty the concept of duty was first introduced by watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier newcomen designs duty is the number of foot-pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel  94 pounds of coal the best examples of newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million but most were closer to 5 million watts original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million but averaged about 17 this was a three-fold improvement over the average newcomen design early watt engines equipped with high-pressure steam improved this to 65 million 67 no heat engine can be more efficient than the carnot cycle in which heat is moved from a high temperature reservoir to one at a low temperature and the efficiency depends on the temperature difference for the greatest efficiency steam engines should be operated at the highest steam temperature possible superheated steam and release the waste heat at the lowest temperature possible the efficiency of a rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small in steam turbines turbine entry temperatures are typically 565c the creep limit of stainless steel and condenser temperatures are around 30c this gives a theoretical carnot efficiency of about 63 compared with an actual efficiency of 42 for a modern coal-fired power station this low turbine entry temperature compared with a gas turbine is why the rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in combined-cycle gas turbine power stationscitation needed one of the principal advantages the rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point by condensing the fluid the work required by the pump consumes only 1 to 3 of the turbine power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle the benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature gas turbines for instance have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500c nonetheless the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas turbines are fairly well matchedcitation needed in practice a steam engine exhausting the steam to atmosphere will typically have an efficiency including the boiler in the range of 1-10 but with the addition of a condenser and multiple expansion and high steam pressuretemperature it may be greatly improved historically into the regime of 10-20 and very rarely slightly higher a modern large electrical power station producing several hundred megawatts of electrical output with steam reheat economizer etc will achieve efficiency in the mid 40 range with the most efficient units approaching 50 thermal efficiency 68 it is also possible to capture the waste heat using cogeneration in which the waste heat is used for heating a lower boiling point working fluid or as a heat source for district heating via saturated low-pressure steam  see alsoedit compound locomotive geared steam locomotive history of steam road vehicles james rumsey leans engine reporter list of steam
