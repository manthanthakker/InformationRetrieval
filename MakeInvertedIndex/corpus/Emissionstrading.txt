tariff carbon diet food miles 2000-watt society carbon footprint v t e emissions trading or cap and trade is a government-mandated market-based approach to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of pollutants 1 in contrast to command-and-control environmental regulations such as best available technology bat standards and government subsidies cap and trade schemes are a type of flexible environmental regulation 2 that allows organizations to decide how best to meet policy targets various countries states and groups of companies have adopted such trading systems notably for mitigating climate change 3 a central authority usually a governmental body allocates or sells a limited number of permits to discharge specific quantities of a specific pollutant per time period 4 polluters are required to hold permits in amount equal to their emissions polluters that want to increase their emissions must buy permits from others willing to sell them 1 5 6 7 8 financial derivatives of permits can also be traded on secondary markets 9 in theory polluters who can reduce emissions most cheaply will do so achieving the emission reduction at the lowest cost to society 10 cap and trade is meant to provide the private sector with the flexibility required to reduce emissions while stimulating technological innovation and economic growth 11 there are active trading programs in several air pollutants for greenhouse gases which may cause dangerous climate change permit units are often called carbon credits the largest greenhouse gases trading program is the european union emission trading scheme 12 which trades primarily in european union allowances euas the californian scheme trades in california carbon allowances the new zealand scheme in new zealand units and the australian scheme in australian units 9 2 the united states has a national market to reduce acid rain and several regional markets in

is an effect of some activity on an entity such as a person that is not party to a market transaction related to that activity emissions trading is a market-based approach among others to address pollution the overall goal of an emissions trading plan is to minimize the cost of meeting a set emissions target 14 in an emissions trading system the government sets an overall limit on emissions and defines permits also called allowances or limited authorizations to emit up to the level of the overall limit the government may sell the permits but in many existing schemes it gives permits to participants regulated polluters equal to each participants baseline emissions the baseline is determined by reference to the participants historical emissions to demonstrate compliance a participant must hold permits at least equal to the quantity of pollution it actually emitted during the time period if every participant complies the total pollution emitted will be at most equal to the sum of individual limits 15 because permits can be bought and sold a participant can choose either to use its permits exactly by reducing its own emissions or to emit less than its permits and perhaps sell the excess permits or to emit more than its permits and buy permits from other participants in effect the buyer pays a charge for polluting while the seller gains a reward for having reduced emissions in many schemes organizations which do not pollute and therefore have no obligations may also trade permits and financial derivatives of permits in some schemes participants can bank allowances to use in future periods 16 in some schemes a proportion of all traded permits must be retired periodically causing a net reduction in emissions over time thus environmental groups may buy and retire permits driving up the price of the remaining permits according to the law of demand 17 in most schemes permit owners can donate permits to a nonprofit entity and receive a tax deduction usually the government lowers the overall limit over time with an aim towards a national emissions reduction target 14 according to the environmental defense fund cap-and-trade is the most environmentally and economically sensible approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions the primary cause of global warming because it sets a limit on emissions and the trading incentivizes companies innovate in order to emit less 18 international trade can offer a range of positive and negative incentives to promote international cooperation on climate change robust evidence medium agreement three issues are key to developing constructive relationships between international trade and climate agreements how existing trade policies and rules can be modified to be more climate friendly whether border adjustment measures bams or other trade measures can be effective in meeting the goals of international climate agreements whether the unfccc world trade organization wto hybrid of the two or a new institution is the best forum for a trade-and-climate architecture 19 market and least-costedit economy-wide pricing of carbon is the centre piece of any policy designed to reduce emissions at the lowest possible costs many economists have urged the use of market-based instruments such as emissions trading to address environmental problems instead of prescriptive command-and-control regulation 21 command and control regulation is criticized for being insensitive to geographical and technological differences and therefore inefficient 22 after an emissions limit has been set by a government political process individual companies are free to choose how or whether to reduce their emissions failure to report emissions and surrender emission permits is often punishable by a further government regulatory mechanism such as a fine that increases costs of production firms will choose the least-cost way to comply with the pollution regulation which will lead to reductions where the least expensive solutions exist while allowing emissions that are more expensive to reduce under an emissions trading system each regulated polluter has flexibility to use the most cost-effective combination of buying or selling emission permits reducing its emissions by installing cleaner technology or reducing its emissions by reducing production the most cost-effective strategy depends on the polluters marginal abatement cost and the market price of permits in theory a polluters decisions should lead to an economically efficient allocation of reductions among polluters and lower compliance costs for individual firms and for the economy overall compared to command-and-control mechanisms 23 24 emission marketsedit for emissions trading where greenhouse gases are regulated one emissions permit is considered equivalent to one metric ton of carbon dioxide co2 emissions other names for emissions permits are carbon credits kyoto units assigned amount units and certified emission reduction units cer these permits can be sold privately or in the international market at the prevailing market price these trade and settle internationally and hence allow permits to be transferred between countries each international transfer is validated by the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc each transfer of ownership within the european union is additionally validated by the european commission emissions trading programmes such as the european union emissions trading system eu ets complement the country-to-country trading stipulated in the kyoto protocol by allowing private trading of permits under such programmes  which are generally co-ordinated with the national emissions targets provided within the framework of the kyoto protocol  a national or international authority allocates permits to individual companies based on established criteria with a view to meeting national andor regional kyoto targets at the lowest overall economic cost 25 trading exchanges have been established to provide a spot market in permits as well as futures and options market to help discover a market price and maintain liquidity carbon prices are normally quoted in euros per tonne of carbon dioxide or its equivalent co2e other greenhouse gases can also be traded but are quoted as standard multiples of carbon dioxide with respect to their global warming potential these features reduce the quotas financial impact on business while ensuring that the quotas are met at a national and international level currently there are six exchanges trading in unfccc related carbon credits the chicago climate exchange until 2010 26 european climate exchange nasdaq omx commodities europe powernext commodity exchange bratislava and the european energy exchange nasdaq omx commodities europe listed a contract to trade offsets generated by a cdm carbon project called certified emission reductions many companies now engage in emissions abatement offsetting and sequestration programs to generate credits that can be sold on one of the exchanges at least one private electronic market has been established in 2008 cantorco2e 27 carbon credits at commodity exchange bratislava are traded at special platform called carbon place 28 trading in emission permits is one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services in the city of london with a market estimated to be worth about €30 billion in 2007 louis redshaw head of environmental markets at barclays capital predicts that carbon will be the worlds biggest commodity market and it could become the worlds biggest market overall 29 historyedit the international community began the long process towards building effective international and domestic measures to tackle ghg 30carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydroflurocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride emissions in response to the increasing assertions that global warming is happening due to man-made emissions and the uncertainty over its likely consequences that process began in rio in 1992 when 160 countries agreed the un framework convention on climate change unfccc the unfccc is as its title suggests simply a framework the necessary detail was left to be settled by the conference of parties cop to the unfccc 31 the efficiency of what later was to be called the cap-and-trade approach to air pollution abatement was first demonstrated in a series of micro-economic computer simulation studies between 1967 and 1970 for the national air pollution control administration predecessor to the united states environmental protection agencys office of air and radiation by ellison burton and william sanjour these studies used mathematical models of several cities and their emission sources in order to compare the cost and effectiveness of various control strategies 32 33 34 35 36 each abatement strategy was compared with the least cost solution produced by a computer optimization program to identify the least costly combination of source reductions in order to achieve a given abatement goal in each case it was found that the least cost solution was dramatically less costly than the same amount of pollution reduction produced by any conventional abatement strategy 37 burton and later sanjour along with edward h pechan continued improving  38 and advancing 39 these computer models at the newly created us environmental protection agency the agency introduced the concept of computer modeling with least cost abatement strategies ie emissions trading in its 1972 annual report to congress on the cost of clean air 40 this led to the concept of cap and trade as a means of achieving the least cost solution for a given level of abatement the development of emissions trading over the course of its history can be divided into four phases 41 in the united states the acid rain-related emission trading system was principally conceived by c boyden gray a ghw bush administration attorney gray worked with the environmental defense fund edf who worked with the epa to write the bill that became law as part of the clean air act of 1990 the new emissions cap on nox and so 2 gases took effect in 1995 and according to smithsonian magazine those acid rain emissions dropped 3 million tons that year 46 in 1997 the cop agreed in what has been described as a watershed in international environmental treaty making the kyoto protocol where 38 developed countriesannex 1 countries committed themselves to targets and timetables for the reduction of ghgs 47 these targets for developed countries are often referred to as assigned amounts one important economic reality recognised by many of the countries that signed the kyoto protocol is that if countries have to solely rely on their own domestic measures the resulting inflexible limitations on ghg growth could entail very large costs perhaps running into many trillions of dollars globally 48 as a result international mechanisms which would allow developed countries flexibility to meet their targets were included in the kyoto protocol the purpose of these mechanisms is to allow the parties to find the most economic ways to achieve their targets these international mechanisms are outlined under kyoto protocol 49 on april 17 2009 the environmental protection agency epa formally announced that it had found that greenhouse gas ghg poses a threat to public health and the environment epa 2009a this announcement was significant because it gives the executive branch the authority to impose carbon regulations on carbon-emitting entities 50 a carbon cap-and-trade system is to be introduced nationwide in china in 2016 51 chinas national development and reform commission proposed that an absolute cap be placed on emission by 2016 52 public opinionedit in the united states most polling shows large support for emissions trading often referred to as cap-and-trade this majority support can be seen in polls conducted by washington postabc news 53 zogby international 54 and yale university 55 a new washington post-abc poll reveals that majorities of the american people believe in climate change are concerned about it are willing to change their lifestyles and pay more to address it and want the federal government to regulate greenhouse gases they are however ambivalent on cap-and-trade 56 more than three-quarters of respondents 77.0 reported they strongly support  51.0 or somewhat support  26.0 the epas decision to regulate carbon emissions while 68.6 of respondents reported being very willing  23.0 or somewhat willing  45.6 another 26.8 reported being somewhat unwilling  8.8 or not at all willing  18.0 to pay higher prices for green energy sources to support funding for programs that reduce the effect of global warming 56 according to politifact it is a misconception that emissions trading is unpopular in the united states because of earlier polls from zogby international and rasmussen which misleadingly include new taxes in the questions taxes arent part of emissions trading or high energy cost estimates 57 however home energy costs are going up directly due to government-mandated cap and trade programs new taxes and higher energy costs are integral to public opinion polling on this subject comparison with other methods of emission reductionedit cap and trade is the textbook emissions trading program other market-based approaches include baseline-and-credit and pollution tax they all put a price on pollution for example see carbon price and so provide an economic incentive to reduce pollution beginning with the lowest-cost opportunities by contrast in a command-and-control approach a central authority designates pollution levels each facility is allowed to emit baseline and creditedit in a baseline and credit program polluters can create permits called credits or offsets by reducing their emissions below a baseline level which is often the historical emissions level from a designated past year 58 such credits can be bought by polluters that have a regulatory limit 59 pollution taxedit emissions fees or environmental tax is a surcharge on the pollution created while producing goods and services 60 for example a carbon tax is a tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels that aims to discourage their use and thereby reduce carbon dioxide emissions 61 the two approaches are overlapping sets of policy designs both can have a range of scopes points of regulation and price schedules they can be fair or unfair depending on how the revenue is used both have the effect of increasing the price of goods such as fossil fuels to consumers 62 a comprehensive upstream auctioned cap-and-trade system is very similar to a comprehensive upstream carbon tax yet many commentators sharply contrast the two approaches the main difference is what is defined and what derived a tax is a price control while cap-and-trade method acts is a quantity control instrument 62 that is a tax is a unit price for pollution that is set by authorities and the market determines the quantity emitted in cap and trade authorities determine the amount of pollution and the market determines the price 63 this difference affects a number of criteria 60 responsiveness to inflation cap-and-trade has the advantage that it adjusts to inflation changes to overall prices automatically while emissions fees must be changed by regulators responsiveness to cost changes it is not clear which approach is better it is possible to combine the two into a safety valve price a price set by regulators at which polluters can buy additional permits beyond the cap responsiveness to recessions this point is closely related to responsiveness to cost changes because recessions cause a drop in demand under cap and trade the emissions cost automatically decreases so a cap-and-trade scheme adds another automatic stabilizer to the economy - in effect an automatic fiscal stimulus however a lower pollution price also results in reduced efforts to reduce pollution if the government is able to stimulate the economy regardless of the cap-and-trade scheme an excessively low price causes a missed opportunity to cut emissions faster than planned instead it might be better to have a price floor a tax this is especially true when cutting pollution is urgent as with greenhouse gas emissions a price floor also provides certainty and stability for investment in emissions reductions recent experience from the uk shows that nuclear power operators are reluctant to invest on un-subsidised terms unless there is a guaranteed price floor for carbon which the eu emissions trading scheme does not presently provide responsiveness to uncertainty as with cost changes in a world of uncertainty it is not clear whether emissions fees or cap-and-trade systems are more efficientit depends on how fast the marginal social benefits of reducing pollution fall with the amount of cleanup eg whether inelastic or elastic marginal social benefit schedule other the magnitude of the tax will depend on how sensitive the supply of emissions is to the price the permit price of cap-and-trade will depend on the pollutant market a tax generates government revenue but full-auctioned emissions permits can do the same a similar upstream cap-and-trade system could be implemented an upstream carbon tax might be the simplest to administer setting up a complex cap-and-trade arrangement that is comprehensive has high institutional needs 64 command-and-control regulationedit command and control is a system of regulation that prescribes emission limits and compliance methods for each facility or source it is the traditional approach to reducing air pollution 58 command-and-control regulations are more rigid than incentive-based approaches such as pollution fees and cap and trade an example of this is a performance standard which sets an emissions goal for each polluter that is fixed and therefore the burden of reducing pollution cannot be shifted to the firms that can achieve it more cheaply as a result performance standards are likely to be more costly overall 60 the additional costs would be passed to end consumers 65 economics of international emissions tradingedit import export balance of trade trade law trade pact trade bloc trade

trade theories balassasamuelson effect linder hypothesis leontief paradox lerner symmetry theorem terms of trade v t e it is possible for a country to reduce emissions using a command-control approach such as regulation direct and indirect taxes the cost of that approach differs between countries because the marginal abatement cost curve mac the cost of eliminating an additional unit of pollution differs by country it might cost china $2 to eliminate a ton of co2 but it would probably cost norway or the us much more international emissions-trading markets were created precisely to exploit differing macs exampleedit emissions trading through gains from trade can be more beneficial for both the buyer and the seller than a simple emissions capping scheme consider two european countries such as germany and sweden each can either reduce all the required amount of emissions by itself or it can choose to buy or sell in the market suppose germany can abate its co2 at a much cheaper cost than sweden ie macs  macg where the mac curve of sweden is steeper higher slope than that of germany and rreq is the total amount of emissions that need to be reduced by a country on the left side of the graph is the mac curve for germany rreq is the amount of required reductions for germany but at rreq the macg curve has not intersected the market emissions permit price of co2 market permit price  p  λ thus given the market price of co2 allowances germany has potential to profit if it abates more emissions than required on the right side is the mac curve for sweden rreq is the amount of required reductions for sweden but the macs curve already intersects the market price of co2 permits before rreq has been reached thus given the market price of co2 permits sweden has potential to make a cost saving if it abates fewer emissions than required internally and instead abates them elsewhere in this example sweden would abate emissions until its macs intersects with p at r but this would only reduce a fraction of swedens total required abatement after that it could buy emissions credits from germany for the price p per unit the internal cost of swedens own abatement combined with the permits it buys in the market from germany adds up to the total required reductions rreq for sweden thus sweden can make a saving from buying permits in the market δ d-e-f this represents the gains from trade the amount of additional expense that sweden would otherwise have to spend if it abated all of its required emissions by itself without trading germany made a profit on its additional emissions abatement above what was required it met the regulations by abating all of the emissions that was required of it rreq additionally germany sold its surplus permits to sweden and was paid p for every unit it abated while spending less than p its total revenue is the area of the graph rreq 1 2 r its total abatement cost is area rreq 3 2 r and so its net benefit from selling emission permits is the area δ 1-2-3 ie gains from trade the two r on both graphs represent the efficient allocations that arise from trading germany sold r - rreq emission permits to sweden at a unit price p sweden bought emission permits from germany at a unit price p if the total cost for reducing a particular amount of emissions in the command control scenario is called x then to reduce the same amount of combined pollution in sweden and germany the total abatement cost would be less in the emissions trading scenario ie x δ 123 - δ def the example above applies not just at the national level but also between two companies in different countries or between two subsidiaries within the same company applying the economic theoryedit the nature of the pollutant plays a very important role when policy-makers decide which framework should be used to control pollution co2 acts globally thus its impact on the environment is generally similar wherever in the globe it is released so the location of the originator of the emissions does not matter from an environmental standpoint 66 the policy framework should be different for regional pollutants 67 eg so2 and nox and also mercury because the impact of these pollutants may differ by location the same amount of a regional pollutant can exert a very high impact in some locations and a low impact in other locations so it matters where the pollutant is released this is known as the hot spot problem a lagrange framework is commonly used to determine the least cost of achieving an objective in this case the total reduction in emissions required in a year in some cases it is possible to use the lagrange optimization framework to determine the required reductions for each country based on their mac so that the total cost of reduction is minimized in such a scenario the lagrange multiplier represents the market allowance price p of a pollutant such as the current market price of emission permits in europe and the usa 68 countries face the permit market price that exists in the market that day so they are able to make individual decisions that would minimize their costs while at the same time achieving regulatory compliance this is also another version of the equi-marginal principle commonly used in economics to choose the most economically efficient decision prices versus quantities and the safety valveedit there has been longstanding debate on the relative merits of price versus quantity instruments to achieve emission reductions 69 an emission cap and permit trading system is a quantity instrument because it fixes the overall emission level quantity and allows the price to vary uncertainty in future supply and demand conditions market volatility coupled with a fixed number of pollution permits creates an uncertainty in the future price of pollution permits and the industry must accordingly bear the cost of adapting to these volatile market conditions the burden of a volatile market thus lies with the industry rather than the controlling agency which is generally more efficient however under volatile market conditions the ability of the controlling agency to alter the caps will translate into an ability to pick winners and losers and thus presents an opportunity for corruption in contrast an emission tax is a price instrument because it fixes the price while the emission level is allowed to vary according to economic activity a major drawback of an emission tax is that the environmental outcome eg a limit on the amount of emissions is not guaranteed on one hand a tax will remove capital from the industry suppressing possibly useful economic activity but conversely the polluter will not need to hedge as much against future uncertainty since the amount of tax will track with profits the burden of a volatile market will be borne by the controlling taxing agency rather than the industry itself which is generally less efficient an advantage is that given a uniform tax rate and a volatile market the taxing entity will not be in a position to pick winners and losers and the opportunity for corruption will be less assuming no corruption and assuming that the controlling agency and the industry are equally efficient at adapting to volatile market conditions the best choice depends on the sensitivity of the costs of emission reduction compared to the sensitivity of the benefits ie climate damage avoided by a reduction when the level of emission control is varied because there is high uncertainty in the compliance costs of firms some argue that the optimum choice is the price mechanism however the burden of uncertainty cannot be eliminated and in this case it is shifted to the taxing agency itself some scientists have warned of a threshold in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide beyond which a run-away warming effect could take place with a large possibility of causing irreversible damage with such a risk a quantity instrument may be a better choice because the quantity of emissions may be capped with more certainty however this may not be true if this risk exists but cannot be attached to a known level of greenhouse gas ghg concentration or a known emission pathway 70 a third option known as a safety valve is a hybrid of the price and quantity instruments the system is essentially an emission cap and permit trading system but the maximum or minimum permit price is capped emitters have the choice of either obtaining permits in the marketplace or buying them from the government at a specified trigger price which could be adjusted over time the system is sometimes recommended as a way of overcoming the fundamental disadvantages of both systems by giving governments the flexibility to adjust the system as new information comes to light it can be shown that by setting the trigger price high enough or the number of permits low enough the safety valve can be used to mimic either a pure quantity or pure price mechanism 71 all three methods are being used as policy instruments to control greenhouse gas emissions the eu-ets is a quantity system using the cap and trading system to meet targets set by national allocation plans denmark has a price system using a carbon tax world bank 2010 p 218 72 while china uses the co2 market price for funding of its clean development mechanism projects but imposes a safety valve of a minimum price per tonne of co2 carbon leakageedit carbon leakage is the effect that regulation of emissions in one countrysector has on the emissions in other countriessectors that are not subject to the same regulation barker et al 2007 73 there is no consensus over the magnitude of long-term carbon leakage goldemberg et al 1996 p 31 74 in the kyoto protocol annex i countries are subject to caps on emissions but non-annex i countries are not barker et al  2007 assessed the literature on leakage the leakage rate is defined as the increase in co2 emissions outside the countries taking domestic mitigation action divided by the reduction in emissions of countries taking domestic mitigation action accordingly a leakage rate greater than 100 means that actions to reduce emissions within countries had the effect of increasing emissions in other countries to a greater extent ie domestic mitigation action had actually led to an increase in global emissions estimates of leakage rates for action under the kyoto protocol ranged from 5 to 20 as a result of a loss in price competitiveness but these leakage rates were considered very uncertain 75 for energy-intensive industries the beneficial effects of annex i actions through technological development were considered possibly substantial however this beneficial effect had not been reliably quantified on the empirical evidence they assessed barker et al  2007 concluded that the competitive losses of then-current mitigation actions eg the eu ets were not significant under the eu ets rules carbon leakage exposure factor is used to determine the volumes of free allocation of emission permits to industrial installations tradeedit to understand carbon trading it is important to understand the products that are being traded the primary product in carbon markets is the trading of ghg emission permits under a cap-and-trade system permits are issued to various entities for the right to emit ghg emissions that meet emission reduction requirement caps 50 one of the controversies about carbon mitigation policy is how to level the playing field with border adjustments 76 for example one component of the american clean energy and security act along with several other energy bills put before us congress calls for carbon surcharges on goods imported from countries without cap-and-trade programs besides issues of compliance with the general agreement on tariffs and trade such border adjustments presume that the producing countries bear responsibility for the carbon emissions a general perception among developing countries is that discussion of climate change in trade negotiations could lead to green protectionism by high-income countries world bank 2010 p 251 72 tariffs on imports virtual carbon consistent with a carbon price of $50 per ton of co2 could be significant for developing countries world bank  2010 commented that introducing border tariffs could lead to a proliferation of trade measures where the competitive playing field is viewed as being uneven tariffs could also be a burden on low-income countries that have contributed very little to the problem of climate change trading systemsedit kyoto protocoledit as the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reports came in over the years they shed abundant light on the true state of global warming and they gave support to the environmental effort to address this unprecedented problem however the same discussions that started decades back had never ceased and the crusade for a tangible solution to global climate change had gone on all the while in 1997 the kyoto protocol was adopted the kyoto protocol is a 1997 international treaty that came into force in 2005 in the treaty most developed nations agreed to legally binding targets for their emissions of the six major greenhouse gases 77 emission quotas known as assigned amounts were agreed by each participating annex i country with the intention of reducing the overall emissions by 5.2 from their 1990 levels by the end of 2012 the united states is the only industrialized nation under annex i that has not ratified the treaty and is therefore not bound by it the ipcc has projected that the financial effect of compliance through trading within the kyoto commitment period will be limited at between 0.1-1.1 of gdp among trading countries 78 the agreement was intended to result in industrialized countries emissions declining in aggregate by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by the year of 2012 despite the failure of the united states and australia to ratify the protocol the agreement became effective in 2005 once the requirement that 55 annex i predominantly industrialized countries jointly accounting for 55 percent of 1990 annex i emissions ratify the agreement was met 79 the protocol defines several mechanisms flexible mechanisms that are designed to allow annex i countries to meet their emission reduction commitments caps with reduced economic impact ipcc 2007 80 under article 3.3 of the kyoto protocol annex i parties may use ghg removals from afforestation and reforestation forest sinks and deforestation sources since 1990 to meet their emission reduction commitments 81 annex i parties may also use international emissions trading iet under the treaty for the 5-year compliance period from 2008 until 2012 82 nations that emit less than their quota will be able to sell assigned amount units each aau representing an allowance to emit one metric tonne of co2 to nations that exceed their quotas 83 it is also possible for annex i countries to sponsor carbon projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other countries these projects generate tradable carbon credits that can be used by annex i countries in meeting their caps the project-based kyoto mechanisms are the clean development mechanism cdm and joint implementation ji there are four such international flexible mechanisms or kyoto mechanism 84 written in the kyoto protocol article 17 if the protocol authorizes annex 1 countries that have agreed to the emissions limitations to take part in emissions trading with other annex 1 countries article 4 authorizes such parties to implement their limitations jointly as the member states of the eu have chosen to do article 6 provides that such annex 1 countries may take part in joint initiatives jis in return for emissions reduction units erus to be used against their assigned amounts art 12 provides for a mechanism known as the clean development mechanism cdm 85 under which annex 1 countries may invest in emissions limitation projects in developing countries and use certified emissions reductions cers generated against their own assigned amounts  86 the cdm covers projects taking place in non-annex i countries while ji covers projects taking place in annex i countries cdm projects are supposed to contribute to sustainable development in developing countries and also generate real and additional emission savings ie savings that only occur thanks to the cdm project in question carbon trust 2009 p 14 87 whether or not these emission savings are genuine is however difficult to prove world bank 2010 pp 265–267 72 australiaedit in 2003 the new south wales nsw state government unilaterally established the nsw greenhouse gas abatement scheme 88 to reduce emissions by requiring electricity generators and large consumers to purchase nsw greenhouse abatement certificates ngacs this has prompted the rollout of free energy-efficient compact fluorescent lightbulbs and other energy-efficiency measures funded by the credits this scheme has been criticised by the centre for energy and environmental markets ceem of the unsw because of its lack of effectiveness in reducing emissions its lack of transparency and its lack of verification of the additionality of emission reductions 89 both the incumbent howard coalition government and the rudd labor opposition promised to implement an emissions trading scheme ets before the 2007 federal election labor won the election with the new government proceeding to implement an ets the government introduced the carbon pollution reduction scheme which the liberals supported with malcolm turnbull as leader tony abbott questioned an ets saying the best way to reduce emissions is with a simple tax 90 shortly before the carbon vote abbott defeated turnbull in a leadership challenge and from there on the liberals opposed the ets this left the government unable to secure passage of the bill and it was subsequently withdrawn julia gillard defeated rudd in a leadership challenge and promised not to introduce a carbon tax but would look to legislate a price on carbon  91 when taking the government to the 2010 election in the first hung parliament result in 70 years the government required the support of crossbenchers including the greens one requirement for greens support was a carbon price which gillard proceeded with in forming a minority government a fixed carbon price would proceed to a floating-price ets within a few years under the plan the fixed price leant itself to characterisation as a carbon tax and when the government proposed the clean energy bill in february 2011 92 the opposition claimed it to be a broken election promise 93 the bill was passed by the lower house in october 2011 94 and the upper house in november 2011 95 the liberal party vowed to overturn the bill if elected 96 the bill thus resulted in passage of the clean energy act which possessed a great deal of flexibility in its design and uncertainty over its future the liberalnational coalition government elected in september 2013 has promised to reverse the climate legislation of the previous government 97 in july 2014 the carbon tax was repealed as well as the emissions trading scheme ets that was to start in 2015 98 new zealandedit the new zealand emissions trading scheme nz ets is a partial-coverage all-free allocation uncapped highly internationally linked emissions trading scheme the nz ets was first legislated in the climate change response emissions trading amendment act 2008 in september 2008 under the fifth labour government of new zealand 99 100 and then amended in november 2009 101 and in november 2012 102 by the fifth national government of new zealand the nz ets covers forestry a net sink energy  43.4 of total 2010 emissions industry  6.7 of total 2010 emissions and waste  2.8 of total 2010 emissions but not pastoral agriculture  47 of 2010 total emissions 103 participants in the nz ets must surrender one emission unit either an international kyoto unit or a new zealand-issued unit for every two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions reported or they may choose to buy nz units from the government at a fixed price of nz$25 104 individual sectors of the economy have different entry dates when their obligations to report emissions and surrender emission units take effect forestry which contributed net removals of 17.5 mts of co2e in 2010  19 of nzs 2008 emissions 105 entered the nz ets on 1 january 2008 106 the stationary energy industrial processes and liquid fossil fuel sectors entered the nz ets on 1 july 2010 the waste sector landfill operators entered on 1 january 2013 107 methane and nitrous oxide emissions from pastoral agriculture are not included in the nz ets from november 2009 agriculture was to enter the nz ets on 1 january 2015 104 the nz ets is highly linked to international carbon markets as it allows the importing of most of the kyoto protocol emission units however as of june 2015 the scheme will effectively transition into a domestic scheme with restricted access to international kyoto units cers erus and rmus 108 the nz ets has a domestic unit the new zealand unit nzu which is issued by free allocation to emitters with no auctions intended in the short term 109 free allocation of nzus varies between sectors the commercial fishery sector who are not participants have a free allocation of units on a historic basis 104 owners of pre-1990 forests have received a fixed free allocation of units 106 free allocation to emissions-intensive industry 110 111 is provided on an output-intensity basis for this sector there is no set limit on the number of units that may be allocated 112 the number of units allocated to eligible emitters is based on the average emissions per unit of output within a defined activity 113 bertram and terry  2010 p 16 state that as the nz ets does not cap emissions the nz ets is not a cap and trade scheme as understood in the economics literature 114 some stakeholders have criticized the new zealand emissions trading scheme for its generous free allocations of emission units and the lack of a carbon price signal the parliamentary commissioner for the environment 115 and for being ineffective in reducing emissions greenpeace aotearoa new zealand 116 the nz ets was reviewed in late 2011 by an independent panel which reported to the government and public in september 2011 117 european unionedit the european union emission trading scheme or eu ets is the largest multi-national greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world it is one of the eus central policy instruments to meet their cap set in the kyoto protocol jones et al 2007 p 64 118 after voluntary trials in the uk and denmark phase i began operation in january 2005 with all 15 member states of the european union participating 119 the program caps the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted from large installations with a net heat supply in excess of 20 mw such as power plants and carbon intensive factories 120 and covers almost half  46 of the eus carbon dioxide emissions 121 phase i permits participants to trade among themselves and in validated credits from the developing world through kyotos clean development mechanism credits are gained by investing in clean technologies and low-carbon solutions and by certain types of emission-saving projects around the world to cover a proportion of their emissions 122 during phases i and ii allowances for emissions have typically been given free to firms which has resulted in them getting windfall profits ccc 2008 p 149 123 ellerman and buchner  2008 referenced by grubb et al 2009 p 11 suggested that during its first two years in operation the eu ets turned an expected increase in emissions of 1-2 per year into a small absolute decline 124 grubb et al  2009 p 11 suggested that a reasonable estimate for the emissions cut achieved during its first two years of operation was 50-100 mtco2 per year or 2.5-5 a number of design flaws have limited the effectiveness of scheme jones et al 2007 p 64 in the initial 2005-07 period emission caps were not tight enough to drive a significant reduction in emissions ccc 2008 p 149 the total allocation of allowances turned out to exceed actual emissions this drove the carbon price down to zero in 2007 this oversupply was caused because the allocation of allowances by the eu was based on emissions data from the european environmental agency in copenhagen which uses a horizontal activity-based emissions definition similar to the united nations the eu ets transaction log in brussels but a vertical installation-based emissions measurement system this caused an oversupply of 200 million tonnes  10 of market in the eu ets in the first phase and collapsing prices 125 phase ii saw some tightening but the use of ji and cdm offsets was allowed with the result that no reductions in the eu will be required to meet the phase ii cap ccc 2008 pp 145 149 for phase ii the cap is expected to result in an emissions reduction in 2010 of about 2.4 compared to expected emissions without the cap business-as-usual emissions jones et al 2007 p 64 for phase iii  2013–20 the european commission proposed a number of changes including setting an overall eu cap with allowances then allocated to eu members tighter limits on the use of offsets unlimited banking of allowances between phases ii and iii a move from allowances to auctioning in january 2008 norway iceland and liechtenstein joined the european union emissions trading system eu ets according to a publication from the european commission 126 the norwegian ministry of the environment has also released its draft national allocation plan which provides a carbon cap-and-trade of 15 million metric tonnes of co2 8 million of which are set to be auctioned 127citation needed according to the oecd economic survey of norway 2010 the nation has announced a target for 2008-12 10 below its commitment under the kyoto protocol and a 30 cut compared with 1990 by 2020  128 in 2012 eu-15 emissions was 15.1 below their base year level based on figures for 2012 by the european environment agency eu-15 emissions averaged 11.8 below base-year levels during the 2008-2012 period this means the eu-15 over-achieved its first kyoto target by a wide margin 129 tokyo japanedit the japanese city of tokyo is like a country in its own right in terms of its energy consumption and gdp tokyo consumes as much energy as entire countries in northern europe and its production matches the gnp of the worlds 16th largest country 130 a scheme to limit carbon emissions launched in april 2010 covers the top 1,400 emitters in tokyo and is enforced and overseen by the tokyo metropolitan government 131 132 phase 1 which is similar to japans scheme ran until 2015 japan had an ineffective voluntary emissions reductions system for years 133 but no nationwide cap-and-trade program emitters must cut their emissions by 6 or 8 depending on the type of organization from 2011 those who exceed their limits must buy matching allowances or invest in renewable-energy certificates or offset credits issued by smaller businesses or branch offices 134 polluters that fail to comply will be fined up to 500,000 yen plus credits for 1.3 times excess emissions 135 in its fourth year emissions were reduced by 23 compared to base-year emissions 136 in phase 2 fy2015-fy2019 the target is expected to increase to 15-17 the aim is to cut tokyos carbon emissions by 25 from 2000 levels by 2020 134 these emission limits can be met by using technologies such as solar panels and advanced fuel-saving devices 132 united statesedit an early example of an emission trading system has been the so2 trading system under the framework of the acid rain program of the 1990 clean air act in the us under the program which is essentially a cap-and-trade emissions trading system so2 emissions were reduced by 50 from 1980 levels by 2007 137 some experts argue that the cap-and-trade system of so2 emissions reduction has reduced the cost of controlling acid rain by as much as 80 versus source-by-source reduction 21 138 the so2 program was challenged in 2004 which set in motion a series of events that led to the 2011 cross-state air pollution rule csapr under the csapr the national so2 trading program was replaced by four separate trading groups for so2 and nox 139 in 1997 the state of illinois adopted a trading program for volatile organic compounds in most of the chicago area called the emissions reduction market system 140 beginning in 2000 over 100 major sources of pollution in eight illinois counties began trading pollution credits in 2003 new york state proposed and attained commitments from nine northeast states to form a cap-and-trade carbon dioxide emissions program for power generators called the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi this program launched on january 1 2009 with the aim to reduce the carbon budget of each states electricity generation sector to 10 below their 2009 allowances by 2018 141 also in 2003 us corporations were able to trade co2 emission allowances on the chicago climate exchange under a voluntary scheme in august 2007 the exchange announced a mechanism to create emission offsets for projects within the united states that cleanly destroy ozone-depleting substances 142 also in 2003 the environmental protection agency epa began to administer the nox budget trading program nbpunder the nox state implementation plan also known as the nox sip call the nox budget trading program was a market-based cap and trade program created to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides nox from power plants and other large combustion sources in the eastern united states nox is a prime ingredient in the formation of ground-level ozone smog a pervasive air pollution problem in many areas of the eastern united states the nbp was designed to reduce nox emissions during the warm summer months referred to as the ozone season when ground-level ozone concentrations are highest in march 2008 epa again strengthened the 8-hour ozone standard to 0.075 parts per million ppm from its previous 0.008 ppm 143 in 2006 the california legislature passed the california global warming solutions act ab-32 which was signed into law by governor arnold schwarzenegger thus far flexible mechanisms in the form of project based offsets have been suggested for three main project types the project types include manure management forestry and destruction of ozone-depleted substances however a recent ruling from judge ernest h goldsmith of san franciscos superior court states that the rules governing californias cap-and-trade system were adopted without a proper analysis of alternative methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 144 the tentative ruling issued on january 24 2011 argues that the california air resources board violated state environmental law by failing to consider such alternatives if the decision is made final the state would not be allowed to implement its proposed cap-and-trade system until the california air resources board fully complies with the california environmental quality act 145 in february 2007 five us states and four canadian provinces joined together to create the western climate initiative wci a regional greenhouse gas emissions trading system 146 in july 2010 a meeting took place to further outline the cap-and-trade system 147 in november 2011 arizona montana new mexico oregon utah and washington withdrew from the wcicitation needed on november 17 2008 president-elect barack obama clarified in a talk recorded for youtube his intentions for the us to enter a cap-and-trade system to limit global warming 148 so2 emissions from acid rain program sources have fallen from 17.3 million tons in 1980 to about 7.6 million tons in 2008 a decrease in emissions of 56 percent ozone season nox emissions decreased by 43 percent between 2003 and 2008 even while energy demand remained essentially flat during the same period cair will result in $85 billion to $100 billion in health benefits and nearly $2 billion in visibility benefits per year by 2015 and will substantially reduce premature mortality in the eastern united statescitation needed a recent epa analysis shows that implementation of the acid rain program is expectedby whom to reduce between 20,000 and 50,000 incidences of premature mortality annually due to reductions of ambient pm2.5 concentrations and between 430 and 2,000 incidences annually due to reductions of ground-level ozone nox reductions due to the nox budget trading program have led to improvements in ozone and pm2.5 saving an estimated 580 to 1,800 lives in 2008 149 the 2010 united states federal budget proposes to support clean energy development with a 10-year investment of us $15 billion per year generated from the sale of greenhouse gas ghg emissions credits under the proposed cap-and-trade program all ghg emissions credits would be auctioned off generating an estimated $78.7 billion in additional revenue in fy 2012 steadily increasing to $83 billion by fy 2019 150 the american clean energy and security act hr 2454 a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade bill was passed on june 26 2009 in the house of representatives by a vote of 219-212 the bill originated in the house energy and commerce committee and was introduced by representatives henry a waxman and edward j markey 151 the political advocacy organizations freedomworks and americans for prosperity funded by brothers david and charles koch of koch industries encouraged the tea party movement to focus on defeating the legislation 152 153 although cap and trade also gained a significant foothold in the senate via the efforts of republican lindsey graham independent and former democrat joe lieberman and democrat john kerry 154 the legislation died in the senate 155 south koreaedit south koreas national emissions trading scheme officially launched on 1 january 2015 covering 525 entities from 23 sectors with a three-year cap of 1.8687 billion tco2e it now forms the second largest carbon market in the world following the eu etsthis amounts to roughly two thirds of the countrys emissions the korean emissions trading scheme is part of the republic of koreas efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 compared to the business-as-usual scenario by 2020 156 chinaedit in november 2011 china approved pilot tests of carbon trading in seven provinces and cities  beijing chongqing shanghai shenzhen tianjin as well as guangdong province and hubei province with different prices in each region 157 the pilot is intended to test the waters and provide valuable lessons for the design of a national system in the near future their successes or failures will therefore have far reaching implications for carbon market development in china in terms of trust in a national carbon trading market some of the pilot regions can start trading as early as 2013/2014 158 national trading is expected to start in 2017 latest in 2020 indiaedit trading is set to begin in 2014 after a three-year rollout period it is a mandatory energy efficiency trading scheme covering eight sectors responsible for 54 per cent of indias industrial energy consumption india has pledged a 20 to 25 per cent reduction in emissions intensity from 2005 levels by 2020 under the scheme annual efficiency targets will be allocated to firms tradable energy-saving permits will be issued depending on the amount of energy saved during a target year 158 renewable energy certificatesedit renewable energy certificates occasionally referred to as or green tags citation required are a largely unrelated form of market-based instruments that are used to achieve renewable energy targets which may be environmentally motivated like emissions reduction targets but may also be motivated by other aims such as energy security or industrial policy carbon marketedit carbon emissions trading is emissions trading specifically for carbon dioxide calculated in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent or tco2e and currently makes up the bulk of emissions trading it is one of the ways countries can meet their obligations under the kyoto protocol to reduce carbon emissions and thereby mitigate global warming market trendedit trading can be done directly between buyers and sellers through several organised exchanges or through the many intermediaries active in the carbon market the price of allowances is determined by supply and demand as many as 40 million allowances have been traded per day in 2012 7.9 billion allowances were traded with a total value of €56 billion 122 carbon emissions trading declined in 2013 and is expected to decline in 2014 159 according to the world banks carbon finance unit 374 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent tco2e were exchanged through projects in 2005 a 240 increase relative to 2004  110 mtco2e 160 which was itself a 41 increase relative to 2003  78 mtco2e 161 global carbon markets have shrunk in value by 60 since 2011 but are expected to rise again in 2014 162 in terms of dollars the world bank has estimated that the size of the carbon market was 11 billion usd in 2005 30 billion usd in 2006 160 and 64 billion in 2007 163 the marrakesh accords of the kyoto protocol defined the international trading mechanisms and registries needed to support trading between countries sources can buy or sell allowances on the open market because the total number of allowances is limited by the cap emission reductions are assured 164 allowance trading now occurs between european countries and asian countries however while the usa as a nation did not ratify the protocol many of its states are developing cap-and-trade systems and considering ways to link them together nationally and internationally to find the lowest costs and improve liquidity of the market 165 however these states also wish to preserve their individual integrity and unique features for example in contrast to other kyoto-compliant systems some states propose other types of greenhouse gas sources different measurement methods setting a maximum on the price of allowances or restricting access to cdm projects creating instruments that are not fungible exchangeable could introduce instability and make pricing difficult various proposals for linking these systems across markets are being investigated and this is being coordinated by the international carbon action partnership icap 165 166 business reactionedit in 2008 barclays capital predicted that the new carbon market would be worth $70 billion worldwide that year 167 the voluntary offset market by comparison is projected to grow to about $4bn by 2010 168 23 multinational corporations came together in the g8 climate change roundtable a business group formed at the january 2005 world economic forum the group included ford toyota british airways bp and unilever on june 9 2005 the group published a statement stating the need to act on climate change and stressing the importance of market-based solutions it called on governments to establish clear transparent and consistent price signals through creation of a long-term policy framework that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases 169 by december 2007 this had grown to encompass 150 global businesses 170 business in the uk have come out strongly in support of emissions trading as a key tool to mitigate climate change supported by ngos 171 however not all businesses favor a trading approach on december 11 2008 rex tillerson the ceo of exxonmobil said a carbon tax is a more direct more transparent and more effective approach than a cap-and-trade program which he said inevitably introduces unnecessary cost and complexity he also said that he hoped that the revenues from a carbon tax would be used to lower other taxes so as to be revenue neutral 172 the international air transport association whose 230 member airlines comprise 93 of all international traffic position is that trading should be based on benchmarking setting emissions levels based on industry averages rather than grandfathering which would use individual companies previous emissions levels to set their future permit allowances they argue grandfathering would penalise airlines that took early action to modernise their fleets while a benchmarking approach if designed properly would reward more efficient operations 173 measuring reporting verificationedit assuring compliance with an emissions trading scheme requires measuring reporting and verification mrv 174 measurements are needed at each operator or installation these measurements are reported to a regulator for greenhouse gases all trading countries maintain an inventory of emissions at national and installation level in addition trading groups within north america maintain inventories at the state level through the climate registry for trading between regions these inventories must be consistent with equivalent units and measurement techniques 175 in some industrial processes emissions can be physically measured by inserting sensors and flowmeters in chimneys and stacks but many types of activity rely on theoretical calculations instead of measurement depending on local legislation measurements may require additional checks and verification by government or third party auditors prior or post submission to the local regulator enforcementedit another troublesome aspect of cap-and-trade is enforcement 176 without effective mrv and enforcement the value of allowances diminishes enforcement methods include fines and sanctions for polluters that have exceeded their allowances concerns include the cost of mrv and enforcement and the risk that facilities may lie about actual emissions the net effect of a corrupt reporting system or poorly managed or financed regulator may be a discount on emission costs and a hidden increase in actual emissions according to nordhaus  2007 p 27 strict enforcement of the kyoto protocol is likely to be observed in those countries and industries covered by the eu ets 177 ellerman and buchner  2007 p 71 commented on the european commissions ecs role in enforcing scarcity of permits within the eu ets 178 this was done by the ecs reviewing the total number of permits that member states proposed that their industries be allocated based on institutional and enforcement considerations kruger et al  2007 pp 130–131 suggested that emissions trading within developing countries might not be a realistic goal in the near-term 179 burniaux et al  2008 p 56 argued that due to the difficulty in enforcing international rules against sovereign states development of the carbon market would require negotiation and consensus-building 180 criticismedit emissions trading has been criticised for a variety of reasons for example in the popular science magazine new scientist lohmann  2006 argued that trading pollution allowances should be avoided as a climate stabilization policy for several reasons first climate change requires more radical changes than previous pollution trading schemes such as the us so2 market it requires reorganizing society and technology to leave most remaining fossil fuels safely underground carbon trading schemes have tended to reward the heaviest polluters with windfall profits when they are granted enough carbon credits to match historic production expensive long-term structural changes will not be made if there are cheaper sources of carbon credits which are often available from less developed countries where they may be generated by local polluters at the expense of local communities 181 research by preston teeter and jorgen sandberg has shown that the flexibility and thus complexity inherent in cap and trade schemes has resulted in a great deal of policy uncertainty surrounding these schemes such uncertainty has beset such schemes in australia canada china the eu india japan new zealand and the us as a result of this uncertainty organizations have little incentive to innovate and comply resulting in an on-going battle of stakeholder contestation for the past two decades 2 lohmann  2006b supported conventional regulation green taxes and energy policies that are justice-based and community-driven 182 according to carbon trade watch  2009 carbon trading has had a disastrous track record the effectiveness of the eu ets was criticized and it was argued that the cdm had routinely favoured environmentally ineffective and socially unjust projects 183 annie leonards 2009 documentary the story of cap and trade criticized carbon emissions trading for the free permits to major polluters giving them unjust advantages cheating in connection with carbon offsets and as a distraction from the search for other solutions 184 offsetsedit forest campaigner jutta kill  2006 of european environmental group fern argued that offsets for emission reductions were not substitute for actual cuts in emissions kill stated that carbon in trees is temporary trees can easily release carbon into the atmosphere through fire disease climatic changes natural decay and timber harvesting 185 permit supply leveledit regulatory agencies run the risk of issuing too many emission credits which can result in a very low price on emission permits ccc 2008 p 140 123 this reduces the incentive that permit-liable firms have to cut back their emissions on the other hand issuing too few permits can result in an excessively high permit price hepburn 2006 p 239 186 this an argument for a hybrid instrument having a price-floor ie a minimum permit price and a price-ceiling ie a limit on the permit price however a price-ceiling safety value removes the certainty of a particular quantity limit of emissions bashmakov et al 2001 187 permit allocation versus auctioningedit if polluters receive emission permits for free grandfathering this may be a reason for them not to cut their emissions because if they do they will receive fewer permits in the future imf 2008 pp 25–26 188 this perverse incentive can be alleviated if permits are auctioned ie sold to polluters rather than giving them the permits for free hepburn 2006 pp 236–237 186 auctioning is a method for distributing emission allowances in a cap-and-trade system whereby allowances are sold to the highest bidder revenues from auctioning go to the government and can be used for development of sustainable technology 189 or to cut distortionary taxes thus improving the efficiency of the overall cap policy fisher et al 1996 p 417 190 on the other hand allocating permits can be used as a measure to protect domestic firms who are internationally exposed to competition p 237 this happens when domestic firms compete against other firms that are not subject to the same regulation this argument in favor of allocation of permits has been used in the eu ets where industries that have been judged to be internationally exposed eg cement and steel production have been given permits for free  4cmr 2008 191 this method of distribution may be combined with other forms of allowance distribution 58 distributional effectsedit the us congressional budget office cbo 2009 examined the potential effects of the american clean energy and security act on us households 192 this act relies heavily on the free allocation of permits the bill was found to protect low-income consumers but it was recommended that the bill be made more efficient by reducing welfare provisions for corporations and more resources be made available for consumer relief linkingedit distinct cap-and-trade systems can be linked together through the mutual or unilateral recognition of emissions allowances for compliance linking systems creates a larger carbon market which can reduce overall compliance costs increase market liquidity and generate a more stable carbon market 193 194 linking systems can also be politically symbolic as it shows willingness to undertake a common effort to reduce ghg emissions 195 some scholars have argued that linking may provide a starting point for developing a new bottom-up international climate policy architecture whereby multiple unique systems successively link their various systems 196 197 in 2014 the us state of california and the canadian province of québec successfully linked their systems in 2015 the provinces of ontario and manitoba agreed to join the linked system between quebec and california 198 the international carbon action partnership brings together regional national and sub-national governments and public authorities from around the world to discuss important issues in the design of emissions trading schemes ets and the way forward to a global carbon market 30 national and subnational jurisdictions have joined icap as members since its
