handle system the handle system is a technology specification for assigning managing and resolving persistent identifiers for digital objects and other resources on the internet the protocols specified enable a distributed computer system to store identifiers names or handles of digital resources and resolve those handles into the information necessary to locate access and otherwise make use of the resources that information can be changed as needed to reflect the current state andor location of the identified resource without changing the handle the handle system was developed by bob kahn co-inventor of the tcpip protocols that underlie the operation of the internet with support from the defense advanced research projects agency darpa at the corporation for national research initiatives cnri which continues to develop and manage it the handle system is currently in use in several applications 1 the handle system enables management of objects as first class entities rather than as packets of bits with dependency on other attributes such as locations it emerged as part of a wider framework for distributed digital object services 2 but has been used in independent applications the system is designed to be scalable 3 to very large numbers of entities without performance degradation to allow distributed administration and to enable resolution to multiple pieces of current data each of which may be separately managed it also has further optional features such as public key infrastructure capability to enable trust applications resolution is the process in which an identifier is the input request to a network service to receive in return a specific output of one or more pieces of current information state data related to the identified entity eg a location url the domain name system resolves domain names meaningful to humans into numerical ip addresses locations of file servers the handle system is compatible with dns but does not necessarily require it unlike persistent identifiers such as purls or arks which utilise domain names and are therefore ultimately constrained by them other significant differences include the administrative granularity possible with the handle system administrators can be different for each handle and there can also be more than one per handle and the option for extensible multiple data types to be assigned 4 dns has well-recognised problems of security and updating which suggest that it will not be sufficient to assume that existing dns technology can simply be adapted to deal with new requirements by explicitly separating names from all associated data including location the handle system addresses a key requirement of future internet architecture a joint research project by the mit laboratory for computer science and air force research laboratory argued that it is possible to separate the ideas of location and identity both of which are represented by the ip address in todays internet  the resulting architecture facilitates mobility as well as solving other problems with todays network 5  contents 1 specifications 2 implementation 3 design principles 4 applications

internet engineering task force ietf it includes an open set of protocols a namespace and a reference implementation of the protocols handles resolve to typed data documentation software and related information is provided by cnri on a dedicated website 9 each handle may have its own administrators and administration of these handles can be done in a distributed environment the name-to-value bindings may also be secured both via signatures to verify the data and via challenge response to verify the transmission of the data allowing handles to be used in trust management applications the syntax of the handle encompasses any unicode character and leaves the string construction to the assigner thereby allowing inclusion of existing identifier strings if desired implementation of the handle system consists of local handle services each of which is made up of one or more sites that provide the servers that store specific handles the global handle registry is a unique local handle service which stores information on the prefixes also known as naming authorities within the handle system and can be queried to find out where specific handles are stored on other local handle services within this distributed system handles can be used natively or expressed as uniform resource names urns or uniform resource identifiers uris although the handle system is not currently a registered stand-alone implementation of uri or urn it is a part of the info uri 10 specification rfc 4452 11 handles may also be expressed as uniform resource locators urls by the use of a http proxy server 12 implementationedit the handle system website provides a series of implementation tools notably the handlenet software 13 and handlenet client libraries 14 handle clients can be embedded in end user software eg a web browser or in server software eg a web server and extensions are already available for adobe acrobat 15 and firefox 16 handle client software libraries are available in both c and java some applications have developed specific add-on tools eg for the doi system 17 the interoperable network of distributed handle resolver servers also known as the proxy server system are linked through a global resolver which is one logical entity though physically decentralised and mirrored users of handle system technology obtain a handle prefix created in the global handle registry 18 the global handle registry maintains and resolves the prefixes of locally maintained handle services any local handle service can therefore resolve any handle through the global resolver handles identifiers are passed by a client as a query of the naming authorityprefix to the handle systems global handle registry ghr the ghr responds by sending the client the location information for the relevant local handle service which may consist of multiple servers in multiple sites a query is then sent to the relevant server within the local handle service the local handle service returns the information needed to acquire the resource eg a url which can then be turned into an http re-direct note if the client already has information on the appropriate lhs to query the initial query to ghr is omitted though the original model from which the handle system derives dealt with management of digital objects the handle system does not mandate any particular model of relationships between the identified entities nor is it limited to identifying only digital objects non-digital entities may be represented as a corresponding digital object for the purposes of digital object management some care is needed in the definition of such objects and how they relate to non-digital entities there are established models that can aid in such definitions eg functional requirements for bibliographic records frbr cidoc crm and indecs content model some applications have found it helpful to marry such a framework to the handle application for example the advanced distributed learning adl initiative 19 brings together handle system application with existing standards for distributed learning content using a shareable content object reference model scorm 20 and the digital object identifier doi system implementation of the handle system has adopted it together with the indecs framework to deal with semantic interoperability the handle system also makes explicit the importance of organizational commitment to a persistent identifier scheme but does not mandate one model for ensuring such commitment individual applications may choose to establish their own sets of rules and social infrastructure to ensure persistence eg when used in the dspace application and the doi application 21 design principlesedit the handle system is designed to meet the following requirements to contribute to persistence 22 23 the identifier string is not based on any changeable attributes of the entity location ownership or any other attribute that may change without changing the referents identity is opaque preferably a dumb number a well known pattern invites assumptions that may be misleading and meaningful semantics may not translate across languages and may cause trademark conflicts is unique within the system to avoid collisions and referential uncertainty has optional but nice to have features that should be supported human-readablecut-and-paste-able embeddable fits common systems eg uri specification the identifier resolution mechanism is reliable using redundancy no single points of failure and fast enough to not appear broken is scalable higher loads simply managed with more computers is flexible can adapt to changing computing environments useful to new applications is trusted both resolution and administration have technical trust methods an operating organization is committed to the long term builds on open architecture encouraging the leverage efforts of a community in building applications on the infrastructure is transparent users need not know the infrastructure details applicationsedit among the objects that are currently identified by handles are journal articles technical reports books theses and dissertations government documents metadata distributed learning content and data sets handles are being used in digital watermarking applications grid applications repositories and more although individual users may download and use the handlenet software independently many users have found it beneficial to collaborate in developing applications in a federation using common policy or additional technology to provide shared services as one of the first persistent identifier schemes the handle system has been widely adopted by public and private institutions and proven over several years see paradigm persistent identifiers 24 handle system applications may use handles as simple persistent identifiers as most commonly used to resolve to the current url of an object or may choose to take advantage of other features its support for the simultaneous return as output of multiple pieces of current information related to the object in defined data structures enables priorities to be established for the order in which the multiple resolutions will be used handles can therefore resolve to different digital versions of the same content to mirror sites or to different business models pay vs free secure vs open public vs private they can also resolve to different digital versions of differing content such as a mix of objects required for a distance-learning course there are thousands of handle services running today located in 71 countries on 6 continents over 1000 of them run at universities and libraries handle services are being run by user federations national laboratories universities computing centers libraries national and local government agencies contractors corporations and research groups major publishers use the handle system for persistent identification of commercially traded and open access content through its implementation with the digital object identifier doi system the number of prefixes which allow users to assign handles is growing and stands at over 12,000 as of early 2014 there are six top-level global handle registry servers that receive on average 68 million resolution requests per month proxy servers known to cnri passing requests to the system on the web receive on average 200 million resolution requests per month statistics from handle quick facts 25 cnri and itu international telecommunication union recently entered into an agreement to collaborate on use of the handle system and the digital object architecture more generally and are working on the specific details of that collaboration in april 2009 itu listed the handle system as an emerging trend 26 licences and use policyedit handle system handlenet and global handle registry are trademarks of the corporation for national research initiatives cnri a non-profit research and development corporation in the usa the handle system is the subject of patents by cnri which licenses its handle system technology through a public license 27 similar to an open source license in order to enable broader use of the technology handle system infrastructure is supported by prefix registration and service fees with the majority coming from single prefix holders the largest current single contributor is the international doi foundation the public license allows commercial and non-commercial use at low cost of both its patented technology and the reference implementation of the software and allows the software to be freely embedded in other systems and products a service agreement 28 is also available for users who intend to provide identifier andor resolution services using the handle system technology under the handle system public license examplesedit related technologiesedit the handle system is the first piece of a long-term digital object architecture in january 2010 cnri released its general-purpose digital object repository software 29 which is the second major component of this architecture more information 30 about the release including protocol specification source code and ready-to-use system clients and utilities is available 31 the third and final piece the digital object registry will be released shortlywhen the continued use and evolution of the handle system is in no way dependent on these other components but those already using handles may find them useful in small or large ways and both are or soon will be freely available under an open source style license referencesedit external linksedit official website persistent identifiers project at paradigm
