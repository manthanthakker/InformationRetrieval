coefficient of performance the coefficient of performance or cop sometimes cp of a heat pump is a ratio of heating or cooling provided to work required 1 2 higher cops equate to lower operating costs the cop may exceed 1 because instead of just converting work to heat which if 100 efficient would be a cop of 1 it pumps additional heat from a heat source to where the heat is required for complete systems cop should include energy consumption of all auxiliaries cop is highly dependent on operating conditions especially absolute temperature and relative temperature between sink and system and is often graphed or averaged against expected conditions 3  contents 1 equation 2 derivation 3 improving cop 4 example 5 conditions of use 6 seasonal efficiency 7 see also 8 notes 9 external links  equationedit the equation is where q  displaystyle q  is the heat supplied by the reservoir w  displaystyle w  is the work supplied to the heat pump the cop for heating and cooling are thus different because the heat reservoir of interest is different when one is interested in how well a machine cools the cop is the ratio of the heat removed from the cold reservoir to input work however for heating the cop is the ratio of the heat removed from the cold reservoir plus the input work to the input work where q c  displaystyle qc  is the heat removed from the hot reservoir q h  displaystyle qh  is the heat supplied to the cold reservoir both means the same for understanding derivationedit according to the first law of thermodynamics in a reversible system we can show that q h o t  q c o l d  w displaystyle qhotqcoldw and w  q h o t  q c o l d displaystyle wqhot-qcold  where q h o t displaystyle qhot is the heat transferred to the hot reservoir and q c o l d displaystyle qcold is the heat collected from the cold reservoir therefore by substituting for w for a heat pump operating at maximum theoretical efficiency ie carnot efficiency it can be shown that where t h o t displaystyle thot and t c o l d displaystyle tcold are the temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs respectively note these equations must use an absolute temperature scale for example kelvin or rankine at maximum theoretical efficiency which is equal to the reciprocal of the ideal efficiency for a heat engine because a heat pump is a heat engine operating in reverse similarly note that the cop of a heat pump depends on its duty the heat rejected to the hot sink is greater than the heat absorbed from the cold source so the heating cop is 1 greater than the cooling cop c o p h e a t i n g displaystyle copheating applies to heat pumps and c o p c o o l i n g displaystyle copcooling applies to air conditioners or refrigerators for heat engines see efficiency values for actual systems will always be less than these theoretical maximums in europe the standard tests for ground source heat pump units use 35c  95f for t h o t displaystyle thot and 0c  32f for t c o l d displaystyle tcold  according to the above formula the maximum achievable cop would be 8.8 test results of the best systems are around 4.5 when measuring installed units over a whole season and accounting for the energy needed to pump water through the piping systems seasonal cops are around 3.5 or less this indicates room for improvement 4 improving copedit as the formula shows the cop of a heat pump system can be improved by reducing the temperature gap t h o t displaystyle thot minus t c o l d displaystyle tcold at which the system works for a heating system this would mean two things 1 reducing the output temperature to around 30c  86f which requires piped floor wall or ceiling heating or oversized water to air heaters and 2 increasing the input temperature eg by using an oversized ground source or by access to a solar-assisted thermal bank  5  accurately determining thermal conductivity will allow for much more precise ground loop  6 or borehole sizing 7 resulting in higher return temperatures and a more efficient system for an air cooler cop could be improved by using ground water as an input instead of air and by reducing temperature drop on output side through increasing air flow for both systems also increasing the size of pipes and air canals would help to reduce noise and the energy consumption of pumps and ventilators by decreasing the speed of fluid which in turn lower the re number and hence the turbulence and noise and the head loss see hydraulic head the heat pump itself can be improved by increasing the size of the internal heat exchangers which in turn increase the efficiency and the price relative to the power of the compressor and also by reducing the systems internal temperature gap over the compressor obviously this latter measure makes such heat pumps unsuitable to produce high temperatures which means that a separate machine is needed for producing hot tap water exampleedit a geothermal heat pump operating at c o p h e a t i n g displaystyle copheating 3.5 provides 3.5 units of heat for each unit of energy consumed ie 1kwh consumed would provide 3.5kwh of output heat the output heat comes from both the heat source and 1kwh of input energy so the heat-source is cooled by 2.5kwh not 3.5kwh a heat pump of c o p h e a t i n g displaystyle copheating 3.5 such as in the example above could be less expensive to use than even the most efficient gas furnace except in areas where the electricity cost per unit is higher than 3.5 times the cost of natural gas eg connecticut or new york city a heat pump cooler operating at c o p c o o l i n g displaystyle copcooling 2.0 removes 2 units of heat for each unit of energy consumed eg an air conditioner consuming 1kwh would remove 2kwh of heat from a buildings air given the same energy source and operating conditions a higher cop heat pump will consume less purchased energy than one with a lower cop the overall environmental impact of a heating or air conditioning installation depends on the source of energy used as well as the cop of the equipment the operating cost to the consumer depends on the cost of energy as well as the cop or efficiency of the unit some areas provide two or more sources of energy for example natural gas and electricity a high cop of a heat pump may not entirely overcome a relatively high cost for electricity compared with the same heating value from natural gas for example the 2009 us average price per therm  100,000 btu of electricity was $3.38 while the average price per therm of natural gas was $1.16 8 using these prices a heat pump with a cop of 3.5 in moderate climate would cost $0.97 9 to provide one therm of heat while a high efficiency gas furnace with 95 efficiency would cost $1.22 10 to provide one therm of heat with these average prices the heat pump costs 20 less 11 to provide the same amount of heat at 0f -18c cop is much lower then the same system costs as much to operate as an efficient gas heater the yearly savings will depend on the actual cost of electricity and natural gas which can both vary widely however a cop may help make a determination of system choice based on carbon contribution although a heat pump may cost more to operate than a conventional natural gas or electric heater depending on the source of electricity generation in ones area it may contribute less net carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than burning natural gas or heating fuel if locally no green electricity is available then carbon-wise the best option would be to drive a heat pump on piped gas or oil to store excess heat in the ground source for use in winter while using the same machine also for producing electricity with a built-in stirling enginecitation needed conditions of useedit while the cop is partly a measure of the efficiency of a heat pump it is also a measure of the conditions under which it is operating the cop of a given heat pump will rise as the input temperature increases or the output temperature decreases because it is linked to a warm temperature distribution system like underfloor heating seasonal efficiencyedit a realistic indication of energy efficiency over an entire year can be archived by using seasonal cop or seasonal coefficient of performance scop for heat seasonal energy efficiency ratio seer is mostly used for air conditioning scop is a new methodology that gives a better indication of expected real-life performance using cop can be considered using the old scale seasonal efficiency gives an indication on how efficient a heat pump operates over an entire
