energy efficiency energy efficiency may refer to energy efficiency physics the ratio between the useful output and input of an energy conversion process electrical efficiency useful power output per electrical power consumed mechanical efficiency a ratio of the measured performance to the performance of an ideal machine thermal efficiency the extent to which the energy added by heat is converted to net work output or vice versa luminous efficiency a measure of how well a light source produces visible light fuel efficiency the efficiency of converting potential energy in a fuel into kinetic energy energy efficiency in transportation the fuel economy of various modes of transportation efficient energy use minimizing the amount of energy used for a given constant energy service energy conservation reducing energy consumption by using less of an energy service electrical efficiency useful power output per electrical power consumed mechanical efficiency a ratio of the measured performance to the performance of an ideal machine thermal efficiency the extent to which the energy added by heat is converted to net work output or vice versa luminous efficiency a measure of how well a light source produces visible light fuel efficiency the efficiency of converting potential energy in a fuel into kinetic energy energy efficiency in transportation the fuel economy of various modes of transportation see alsoedit energy disambiguation efficiency disambiguation all pages with titles containing energy efficiency all pages with titles containing energy efficient
