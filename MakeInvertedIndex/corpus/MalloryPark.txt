although there are a handful of open garages in the pitlane historyedit origins  1950sedit the estate at mallory park has many historical connections the oldest being the unique anglo-saxons defended moat which is now known as kirkby moats while a roman road passes through the estate fast forward to the 18th century when in 1762 sir cleoberry noel became viscount wentworth the title descended on the distaff side lord byron married into the wentworth family and it is said on his visits to mallory he wrote beneath the shade of the lebanon cedar tree which still stands in the grounds of kirkby hall the last occupant of kirkby hall was herbert clarkson who died in 1941 when it was sold during the second world war the circuit started life royal air force station kirkby mallory a standby landing ground slg during wwii and closed in 1947 the hall was a large house which was demolished in 1952 leaving only the stable block and the coach house which now forms the circuit offices workshops hotel pub and restaurant the estate of 300 acres was sold by auction in 1953 and was bought by a mr moult of derby who planned to have horse racing on the disused pony trotting track following the war mallory became a pony trotting circuit in the late 1940s which defined the outline of the oval track still in use today after the financial collapse of the equestrian club responsible for the circuit kirkby mallory racing association the track was hired by various motorcycle clubs for grass track motorcycle and motorcycle sidecar racing for example between september 1949 until 1954 the leicester query motorcycle club held grass track races in 1955 the estate was purchased by clive wormleighton under whose influence the present tarmac was constructed at a cost of £60,000 in 1956 upon completion of the building work a circuit test was held on 26 april when local grand prix driver bob gerard and maurice cann respectively conducted a cooper-bristol formula two car and a moto guzzi motorcycle around the track gerald managing an 81mph lap 3 the very first race was held on 29 april when the leicester query club organised a motorcycle meeting a large crowd in excess of 20,000 spectators attended the grand opening event on 13 may 1956 248 riders arrived in leicestershire for this meeting which saw george salter set the first lap record at a speed of 84.08mph riding a norton bike cars first appeared at the whit monday meeting in event being organised by nottingham sports car club the first car race victory went to d rees in an austin 3 many famous racing stars have raced at mallory over the years indeed a young john surtees raced against his father jack surtees while jack was a successfully grass track racer at mallory john went on to be only world champion on both two and four wheels 3 famous competitors who have raced at mallory include john surtees who won the first race of the year in 1958 while the 1960 race saw mike hailwood win and set a new lap record of 89mph both hailwood and surtees along with jim clark and colin chapman are commemorated with statues at the front gate around this time clive wormleighton added the lakes which were formed by adding the sluice gate across the brook 3 4 1960sedit clive wormleighton continued to run the circuit very successfully until 1962 when ownership passed to the grovewood securities in the july the previous owner remaining in a consultancy capacity until the end of september before this on 11 june 1962 mallory park saw it first non-championship formula one international 2000 guineas

years a considerable amount of money was spent on mallory with the building of new spectator stands and a new commentators press and timekeepers boxes further developments took place raising the standard of the track crowd grew and in 1962 over 50,000 people paid to see the post tt international motor cycle meeting when mike hailwood won improving the lap record to 91.70mph this led to it race of the year and sidecar race of the year being sponsored by the daily mail under the control of grovewood securities mallory enjoyed its golden days in the 1960s and 1970s with some of the greatest names in motorsport competing there amongst these a young austrian who arrived for the whit sunday meeting in 1964 for his first race in england in a new formula two brabham  jochen rindt he asked denny hulme if he could follow him round to learn the circuit and then proceeded to set fastest time in qualifying despite being delayed in the race he finished third behind the reigning world

ferrari pairing of niki lauda and carlos reutemann 1970 saw mallory used as a venue for cycle racing with the world road race championships being run on a road course starting and finishing at mallory and incorporating the circuit reversed each lap the professional event was won by ill-fated belgian jean-pierre monseré 5 formula two returned again 1973 this time morgan could only finish third the victor was frenchman jean-pierre jarier in his works march-bmw 732 second was dave mcconnell after a little over 20 years the owners of mallory park decided that enough was enough and offered the estate for sale no doubt the expense of bringing brands hatch which grovewood also owned up to current grand prix standards had some effort on the decision and the re-opening of donington park which was only some 20 miles away may have influenced the decision whatever the reasons mallory was once more on the market but reportedly with a restriction in its future use for motor sport on its future use for motor racing although planning permission had been obtained for the erection of 30 dwelling on the estate 3 meanwhile famously the bay city rollers tartan army played a concert during a bbc-organised fun day on 18 may 1975 on a stage specifically constructed in the middle of the lake 6 1980s and onwardsedit enter a very determined lady edwina overend who was the competitions secretary of the midlands centre of the british racing and sports car club brscc as the time passed and the 1982 season drew to its close the expected cessation of racing at mallory loomed large and
