nanosolar eugenia corrales ceo nanosolar was a developer of solar power technology based in san jose ca nanosolar developed and briefly commercialized a low-cost printable solar cell manufacturing process the company started selling thin-film cigs panels mid-december 2007 and planned to sell them at 99 cents per watt much below the market at the time however prices for solar panels made of crystalline silicon declined significantly during the following years reducing most of nanosolars cost advantage 2 3 4 by february 2013 nanosolar had laid off 75 of its work force 5 nanosolar began auctioning off its equipment in august 2013 6 co-founder of nanosolar martin roscheisen stated on his personal blog that nanosolar ultimately failed commercially and that he would not enter this industry again because of slow-development cycle complex production problems and the impact of cheap chinese solar power production 7 nanosolar ultimately produced less than 50 mw of solar power

davidow ventures and larry page and sergey brin the founders of google nanosolar received the largest amount in a round of venture capital technology funding amongst united states companies during q2 2006 with 100 million usd of new funding secured 9 it also received the largest amount of financing of any private company in 2008 usd 300 million in q1 nanosolar planned to build a large production facility in san jose and in germany at luckenwalde berlin 10 with an annual capacity of 430 megawatts several german energy and venture capital companies have heavily invested in this company as a consequence of the favourable economics for solar energy in germany due to government subsidies 11 on december 12 2007 the company announced 12 that it had started solar cell production in its san jose factory with its german facility slated to go into operation in the 1st quarter of 2008 the company said in 2006 that the san jose factory when fully built would have the capacity to produce 430 megawatts of cells each year 13 on december 18 2007 the company began shipping its first solar panels for a one-megawatt municipal power plant in germany 14 as of 2008 nanosolar had raised about 500

of the 430 megawatts predicted five years previously managementedit on jan 19 2012 former evp of engineering  operations eugenia corrales was named ceo following ceo geoff tate returning to retirement tate had been ceo of nanosolar since march 22 2010 having been hired out of retirement as an interim ceo for his experience in leading a company into volume production as ceo of rambus 17 tate replaced co-founder martin roscheisen who had been the companys chairman  ceo for the past eight years no reason was given for roscheisens exit 18 on june 25 2012 nano solar hired 3 new sales  marketing executives stephan hansen executive vice president of worldwide sales roy shaw head of north america sales and stefan zschiegner vice president of worldwide marketing prior to joining nanosolar hansen led the european sales organization of first solar for more than seven years shaw brings over 25 years of sales management experience in the solar industry he most recently was director of usa sales at jinko solar a global pv manufacturer producing crystalline ingots wafers cells and mono- and multi- crystalline pv panels prior to jinko solar he was head of western sales at suntech solar corp a global producer of silicon solar modules zschiegner most recently was vice president of global product management and applications at first solar where he focused on solutions for emerging markets balance-of-system and module product management on sep 11 2012 nanosolar appointed karl steigele to the position of president  coo eugenia corrales left the company to pursue other ventures before joining nanosolar steigele spent more than 30 years in international management and consulting at ibm where he worked with fortune 500 global manufacturing companies including intel hitachi abb thomson siemens sony and mckesson among others technologyedit the company used thin film technology to manufacture cigs solar cells that use a semiconductor material made of copper indium gallium and selenium and achieved an efficiency of up to 19.9 in laboratory samples at the time 19 the companys technology gained early industry recognition with the presentation of a small times magazine award at a leading nanotech business event in 2005 20 technical details of nanosolars manufacturing techniques have been disclosed in patent applications 21 some information about their process has become available in a scientific american article in german 22 these details involve a semiconductor ink that it claims will enable it to produce solar cells with a basic printing process rather than using slow and expensive high-vacuum based thin-film deposition processes the ink is deposited on a flexible substrate the paper and then nanocomponents in the ink align themselves properly via molecular self-assembly nanosolars solar cells have been verified by nrel to be as efficient as 14.6 in 2006 22 15.3 in 2009 23 and 17.1 in 2011 24 efficiencies for current production panels are said to be 8-9 with plans to submit panels with 10-11 efficiency for iec certification in the fall of 2010 25 in september 2009 nanosolar announced the launch of production at a rate of 640 mw annually 26 however ramp-up to volume production after the announcement took an additional six months 25 limiting actual production in 2009 to an estimated 4 mw 27 and as of august 2010 the plant was still ramping up toward its announced capacity 28 since the hiring of new ceo geoff tate the company has declined to discuss its actual manufacturing capacity 25 27 but has said that its target for 2010 is to ship panels for several  megawatt-size projects and build panels for projects that have been identified that can help build the case for an operating history and bankability in 2011 25 nanosolar has developed a suite of in-house capabilities for creating nanostructured components based on various patented and patent-pending techniques it uses nanostructured components as the basis for creating printable semiconductors printable transparent electrodes novel forms of advanced nanocomposite solar-cell design and powerful new forms of barrier films 29 according to the company leveraging recent science advances in nanostructured materials nanosolar has developed a proprietary ink that makes it possible to simply print the semiconductor of a high-performance solar cell this ink is based on nanosolar developing various proprietary forms of nanoparticles and associated organic dispersion chemistry and processing techniques suitable for delivering a semiconductor of high electronic quality 30 31 two advantages over earlier technologies is that a printing process is quick and also makes it easy to deposit a uniform layer of the ink resulting in a layer with the correct ratio of elements everywhere on the substrate also the ink is printed only where needed so there is less waste of material last the substrate material on which the ink is printed is much more conductive and less expensive than the stainless steel substrates that are often used in thin-film solar panels these solar cells successfully blend the needs for efficiency low cost and longevity and will be easy to install due to their flexibility and light weight estimates by nanosolar of the cost of these cells fall roughly between 1/10 and 1/5 32 the industry standard per kilowatt however solar module prices have fallen by 60 since that prediction in 2006 33 the company implies that their solar cells can last more than 25 years by saying they achieve a durability compatible with our 25-year warranty 34 they recently commissioned a study by black and veatch that finds their 25-year warranty to be compatible with their module design 25 see alsoedit list of cigs companies
