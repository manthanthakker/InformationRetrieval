blood pressure blood pressure bp is the pressure of circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels when used without further specification blood pressure usually refers to the arterial pressure in the systemic circulation blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic maximum during one heart beat pressure over diastolic minimum in between two heart beats pressure and is measured in millimeters of mercury mmhg above the surrounding atmospheric pressure considered to be zero for convenience it is one of the vital signs along with respiratory rate heart rate oxygen saturation and body temperature normal resting systolic diastolic blood pressure in an adult is approximately 120mmhg  80mmhg abbreviated "120/80mmhg traditionally blood pressure is measured non-invasively using a mercury manometer because these gauges are dependent upon only gravity thus inherently more accurate than alternative types of pressure gauges in research the values obtained by an experienced knowledgeable physician using a mercury manometer and stethoscope listing for the korotkoff sounds are typically within 10 mmhg of the pressures measured via higher sophistication internal measurements of central aortic pressures at heart level other methods which have become more dominant for cost time convenience and concerns about potential mercury toxicity issues are inherently less accurate blood pressure is determined moment by moment by the balance between heart output versus total peripheral resistance and varies depending on situation emotional state activity and relative healthdisease states it is regulated by the brain via both the nervous and endocrine systems blood pressure that is low due to a disease state is called hypotension and pressure that is consistently high is hypertension both have many causes which can range from mild to severe both may be of sudden onset or of long duration long term hypertension is a risk factor for many diseases including heart disease stroke and kidney failure long term hypertension is more common than long term hypotension in western countries long term hypertension often goes undetected because of infrequent monitoring

pressureedit the table presented here shows the classification of blood pressure adopted by the american heart association for adults who are 18 years and older 1 it assumes the values are a result of averaging resting blood pressure readings measured at two or more visits to the doctor 3 4 in the uk clinic blood pressures are usually categorized into three groups low  90/60 or lower normal between 90/60 and 139/89 and high  140/90 or higher 5 6 blood pressure fluctuates from minute to minute and normally shows a circadian rhythm over a 24-hour period with highest readings in the early morning and evenings and lowest readings at night 7 8 loss of the normal fall in blood pressure at night is associated with a greater future risk of cardiovascular disease and there is evidence that night-time blood pressure is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular events than day-time blood pressure 9 various factors such as age and sex influence a persons blood pressure and variations in it in children the normal ranges are lower than for adults and depend on height 10 reference blood pressure values have been developed for children in different countries based on the distribution of blood pressure in children of these countries 11 as adults age systolic pressure tends to rise and diastolic tends to fall 12 in the elderly systolic blood pressure tends to be above the normal adult range 13 thought to be largely because of reduced flexibility of the arteries also an individuals blood pressure varies with exercise emotional reactions sleep digestion and time of day circadian rhythm differences between left and right arm blood pressure measurements tend to be random and average to nearly zero if enough measurements are taken however in a small percentage of cases there is a consistent difference greater than 10mmhg which may need further investigation eg for obstructive arterial disease 14 15 the risk of cardiovascular disease increases progressively above 115/75mmhg 16 in the past hypertension was only diagnosed if secondary signs of high arterial pressure were present along with a prolonged high systolic pressure reading over several visits regarding hypotension in practice blood pressure is considered too low only if noticeable symptoms are present 2 clinical trials demonstrate that people who maintain arterial pressures at the low end of these pressure ranges have much better long term cardiovascular health the principal medical debate concerns the aggressiveness and relative value of methods used to lower pressures into this range for those who do not maintain such pressure on their own elevations more commonly seen in older people though often considered normal are associated with increased morbidity and mortality mean arterial pressureedit the mean arterial pressure map is the average over a cardiac cycle and is determined by the cardiac output co systemic vascular resistance svr and central venous pressure cvp 18 in practice the contribution of cvp which is small is generally ignored and so map can be estimated from measurements of the systolic pressure p sys displaystyle ptextsys  and the diastolic pressure p dias displaystyle ptextdias  18 pulse pressureedit the pulse pressure is the difference between the measured systolic and diastolic pressures 19 the up and down fluctuation of the arterial pressure results from the pulsatile nature of the cardiac output ie the heartbeat pulse pressure is determined by the interaction of the stroke volume of the heart the compliance ability to expand of the arterial systemlargely attributable to the aorta and large elastic arteriesand the resistance to flow in the arterial tree by expanding under pressure the aorta absorbs some of the force of the blood surge from the heart during a heartbeat in this way the pulse pressure is reduced from what it would be if the aorta were not compliant 19 the loss of arterial compliance that occurs with aging explains the elevated pulse pressures found in elderly patients systemic venous pressureedit pulmonary capillary wedge pressure blood pressure generally refers to the arterial pressure in the systemic circulation however measurement of pressures in the venous system and the pulmonary vessels plays an important role in intensive care medicine but requires invasive measurement of pressure using a catheter venous pressure is the vascular pressure in a vein or in the atria of the heart it is much less than arterial pressure with common values of 5mmhg in the right atrium and 8mmhg in the left atrium variants of venous pressure include central venous pressure which is a good approximation of right atrial pressure 21 which is a major determinant of right ventricular end diastolic volume however there can be exceptions in some cases 22 the jugular venous pressure jvp is the indirectly observed pressure over the venous system it can be useful in the differentiation of different forms of heart and lung disease the portal venous pressure is the blood pressure in the portal vein it is normally 5–10mmhg 23 pulmonary pressureedit normally the pressure in the pulmonary artery is about 15mmhg at rest 24 increased blood pressure in the capillaries of the lung cause pulmonary hypertension leading to interstitial edema if the pressure increases to above 20mmhg and to pulmonary edema at pressures above 25mmhg 25 disordersedit disorders of blood pressure control include high blood pressure low blood pressure and blood pressure that shows excessive or maladaptive fluctuation highedit arterial hypertension can be an indicator of other problems and may have long-term adverse effects sometimes it can be an acute problem for example hypertensive emergency levels of arterial pressure put mechanical stress on the arterial walls higher pressures increase heart workload and progression of unhealthy tissue growth atheroma that develops within the walls of arteries the higher the pressure the more stress that is present and the more atheroma tend to progress and the heart muscle tends to thicken enlarge and become weaker over time persistent hypertension is one of the risk factors for strokes heart attacks heart failure and arterial aneurysms and is the leading cause of chronic kidney failure even moderate elevation of arterial pressure leads to shortened life expectancy at severely high pressures mean arterial pressures 50 or more above average a person can expect to live no more than a few years unless appropriately treated 26 in the past most attention was paid to diastolic pressure but nowadays it is recognised that both high systolic pressure and high pulse pressure the numerical difference between systolic and diastolic pressures are also risk factors in some cases it appears that a decrease in excessive diastolic pressure can actually increase risk due probably to the increased difference between systolic and diastolic pressures see the article on pulse pressure if systolic blood pressure is elevated >140mmhg with a normal diastolic blood pressure <90mmhg it is called isolated systolic hypertension and may present a health concern 27 28 for those with heart valve regurgitation a change in its severity may be associated with a change in diastolic pressure in a study of people with heart valve regurgitation that compared measurements 2 weeks apart for each person there was an increased severity of aortic and mitral regurgitation when diastolic blood pressure increased whereas when diastolic blood pressure decreased there was a decreased severity 29 lowedit blood pressure that is too low is known as hypotension hypotension is a medical concern if it causes signs or symptoms such as dizziness fainting or in extreme cases shock 4 when arterial pressure and blood flow decrease beyond a certain point the perfusion of the brain becomes critically decreased ie the blood supply is not sufficient causing lightheadedness dizziness weakness or fainting 30 sometimes the arterial pressure drops significantly when a patient stands up from sitting this is known as orthostatic hypotension postural hypotension gravity reduces the rate of blood return from the body veins below the heart back to the heart thus reducing stroke volume and cardiac outputcitation needed when people are healthy the veins below their heart quickly constrict and the heart rate increases to minimize and compensate for the gravity effect this is carried out involuntarily by the autonomic nervous system the system usually requires a few seconds to fully adjust and if the compensations are too slow or inadequate the individual will suffer reduced blood flow to the brain dizziness and potential blackout increases in g-loading such as routinely experienced by aerobatic or combat pilots pulling gs greatly increases this effect repositioning the body perpendicular to gravity largely eliminates the problemcitation needed other causes of low arterial pressure includecitation needed sepsis hemorrhage  blood loss toxins including toxic doses of blood pressure medicine hormonal abnormalities such as addisons disease eating disorders particularly anorexia nervosa and bulimia shock is a complex condition which leads to critically decreased perfusion the usual mechanisms are loss of blood volume pooling of blood within the veins reducing adequate return to the heart andor low effective heart pumping low arterial pressure especially low pulse pressure is a sign of shock and contributes to and reflects decreased perfusioncitation needed if there is a significant difference in the pressure from one arm to the other that may indicate a narrowing for example due to aortic coarctation aortic dissection thrombosis or embolism of an arterycitation needed fluctuating blood pressureedit normal fluctuation in blood pressure is adaptive and necessary fluctuations in pressure that are significantly greater than the norm are associated with greater white matter hyperintensity a finding consistent with reduced local cerebral blood flow 31 and a heightened risk of cerebrovascular disease 32 within both high and low blood pressure groups a greater degree of fluctuation was found to correlate with an increase in cerebrovascular disease compared to those with less variability suggesting the consideration of the clinical management of blood pressure fluctuations even among normotensive older adults 32 older individuals and those who had received blood pressure medications were more likely to exhibit larger fluctuations in pressure 32 physiologyedit during each heartbeat blood pressure varies between a maximum systolic and a minimum diastolic pressure 33 the blood pressure in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart 34 differences in mean blood pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation the rate of mean blood flow depends on both blood pressure and the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood moves away from the heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles 35 gravity affects blood pressure via hydrostatic forces eg during standing and valves in veins breathing and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence blood pressure in veins 34 hemodynamicsedit most influences on blood pressure can be understood in terms of their effect on cardiac output and resistance the determinants of mean arterial pressure 36 some factors are blood volume the greater the blood volume the higher the cardiac output there is some relationship between dietary salt intake and increased blood volume potentially resulting in higher arterial pressure though this varies with the individual and is highly dependent on autonomic nervous system response and the reninangiotensin system 37 38 39 cardiac output the pumping action of the heart is ultimately responsible for blood pressure increases or decreases in cardiac output can result in increases or decreases respectively in blood pressure 40 systemic vascular resistance the higher the resistance to blood flow the higher the arterial pressure upstream needs to be to maintain flow in simple terms resistance is related to vessel radius by the hagen-poiseuilles equation resistance∝1radius4 so the smaller the radius the very much higher the resistance other physical factors that affect resistance include vessel length the longer the vessel the higher the resistance blood viscosity the higher the viscosity the higher the resistance 41 and the presence of an arterial stenosis a narrow stenosis increases resistance to flow however this increase in resistance rarely if ever increases systemic blood pressure it decreases downstream flow 42 substances called vasoconstrictors can reduce the calibre of blood vessels thereby increasing blood pressure vasodilators such as nitroglycerin increase the calibre of blood vessels thereby decreasing arterial pressure in practice each individuals autonomic nervous system and other systems regulating blood pressure respond to and regulate all these factors so that although the above issues are important they rarely act in isolation and the actual arterial pressure response of a given individual can vary widely in the short and long-term regulationedit the endogenous regulation of arterial pressure is not completely understood but the following mechanisms of regulating arterial pressure have been well-characterized baroreceptor reflex baroreceptors in the high pressure receptor zones detect changes in arterial pressure these baroreceptors send signals ultimately to the medulla of the brain stem specifically to the rostral ventrolateral medulla rvlm the medulla by way of the autonomic nervous system adjusts the mean arterial pressure by altering both the force and speed of the hearts contractions as well as the systemic vascular resistance the most important arterial baroreceptors are located in the left and right carotid sinuses and in the aortic arch 43 renin-angiotensin system ras this system is generally known for its long-term adjustment of arterial pressure this system allows the kidney to compensate for loss in blood volume or drops in arterial pressure by activating an endogenous vasoconstrictor known as angiotensin ii aldosterone release this steroid hormone is released from the adrenal cortex in response to angiotensin ii or high serum potassium levels aldosterone stimulates sodium retention and potassium excretion by the kidneys since sodium is the main ion that determines the amount of fluid in the blood vessels by osmosis aldosterone will increase fluid retention and indirectly arterial pressure baroreceptors in low pressure receptor zones mainly in the venae cavae and the pulmonary veins and in the atria result in feedback by regulating the secretion of antidiuretic hormone adhvasopressin renin and aldosterone the resultant increase in blood volume results in an increased cardiac output by the frankstarling law of the heart in turn increasing arterial blood pressure these different mechanisms are not necessarily independent of each other as indicated by the link between the ras and aldosterone release when blood pressure falls many physiological cascades commence in order to return the blood pressure to a more appropriate level currently the ras is targeted pharmacologically by ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor antagonists the aldosterone system is directly targeted by spironolactone an aldosterone antagonist the fluid retention may be targeted by diuretics the antihypertensive effect of diuretics is due to its effect on blood volume generally the baroreceptor reflex is not targeted in hypertension because if blocked individuals may suffer from orthostatic hypotension and fainting measurementedit arterial pressure is most commonly measured via a sphygmomanometer which historically used the height of a column of mercury to reflect the circulating pressure 44 blood pressure values are generally reported in millimetres of mercury mmhg though aneroid and electronic devices do not contain mercury for each heartbeat blood pressure varies between systolic and diastolic pressures systolic pressure is peak pressure in the arteries which occurs near the end of the cardiac cycle when the ventricles are contracting diastolic pressure is minimum pressure in the arteries which occurs near the beginning of the cardiac cycle when the ventricles are filled with blood an example of normal measured values for a resting healthy adult human is 120mmhg systolic and 80mmhg diastolic written as 120/80mmhg and spoken as one-twenty over eighty systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures are not static but undergo natural variations from one heartbeat to another and throughout the day in a circadian rhythm they also change in response to stress nutritional factors drugs disease exercise and momentarily from standing up sometimes the variations are large hypertension refers to arterial pressure being abnormally high as opposed to hypotension when it is abnormally low along with body temperature respiratory rate and pulse rate blood pressure is one of the four main vital signs routinely monitored by medical professionals and healthcare providers 45 measuring pressure invasively by penetrating the arterial wall to take the measurement is much less common and usually restricted to a hospital setting non-invasiveedit the non-invasive auscultatory and oscillometric measurements are simpler and quicker than invasive measurements require less expertise have virtually no complications are less unpleasant and less painful for the patient however non-invasive methods may yield somewhat lower accuracy and small systematic differences in numerical results non-invasive measurement methods are more commonly used for routine examinations and monitoring palpationedit a minimum systolic value can be roughly estimated by palpation most often used in emergency situations but should be used with caution 46 it has been estimated that using 50 percentiles carotid femoral and radial pulses are present in patients with a systolic blood pressure  70mmhg carotid and femoral pulses alone in patients with systolic blood pressure of  50mmhg and only a carotid pulse in patients with a systolic blood pressure of  40mmhg 46 a more accurate value of systolic blood pressure can be obtained with a sphygmomanometer and palpating the radial pulse 47 the diastolic blood pressure cannot be estimated by this method the american heart association recommends that palpation be used to get an estimate before using the auscultatory method auscultatoryedit the auscultatory method from the latin word for listening uses a stethoscope and a sphygmomanometer this comprises an inflatable riva-rocci cuff placed around the upper arm at roughly the same vertical height as the heart attached to a mercury or aneroid manometer the mercury manometer considered the gold standard measures the height of a column of mercury giving an absolute result without need for calibration and consequently not subject to the errors and drift of calibration which affect other methods the use of mercury manometers is often required in clinical trials and for the clinical measurement of hypertension in high-risk patients such as pregnant women a cuff of the appropriate size 48 is fitted smoothly and also snugly then inflated manually by repeatedly squeezing a rubber bulb until the artery is completely occluded it is important that the cuff size is correct undersized cuffs record too high a pressure oversized cuffs may yield too low a pressure 49 usually three or four cuff sizes should be available to allow measurements in arms of different size 49 listening with the stethoscope to the brachial artery at the antecubital area of the elbow the examiner slowly releases the pressure in the cuff when blood just starts to flow in the artery the turbulent flow creates a whooshing or pounding first korotkoff sound 50 the pressure at which this sound is first heard is the systolic blood pressure the cuff pressure is further released until no sound can be heard fifth korotkoff sound at the diastolic arterial pressure the auscultatory method is the predominant method of clinical measurement 51 oscillometricedit the oscillometric method was first demonstrated in 1876 and involves the observation of oscillations in the sphygmomanometer cuff pressure 52 which are caused by the oscillations of blood flow ie the pulse 53 the electronic version of this method is sometimes used in long-term measurements and general practice it uses a sphygmomanometer cuff like the auscultatory method but with an electronic pressure sensor transducer to observe cuff pressure oscillations electronics to automatically interpret them and automatic inflation and deflation of the cuff the pressure sensor should be calibrated periodically to maintain accuracy oscillometric measurement requires less skill than the auscultatory technique and may be suitable for use by untrained staff and for automated patient home monitoring as for the auscultatory technique it is important that the cuff size is appropriate for the arm there are some single cuff devices that may be used for arms of differing sizes although experience with these is limited 49 the cuff is inflated to a pressure initially in excess of the systolic arterial pressure and then reduced to below diastolic pressure over a period of about 30seconds when blood flow is nil cuff pressure exceeding systolic pressure or unimpeded cuff pressure below diastolic pressure cuff pressure will be essentially constant when blood flow is present but restricted the cuff pressure which is monitored by the pressure sensor will vary periodically in synchrony with the cyclic expansion and contraction of the brachial artery ie it will oscillate over the deflation period the recorded pressure waveform forms a signal known as the cuff deflation curve a bandpass filter is utilized to extract the oscillometric pulses from the cuff deflation curve over the deflation period the extracted oscillometric pulses form a signal known as the oscillometric waveform omw the amplitude of the oscillometric pulses increases to a maximum and then decreases with further deflation a variety of analysis algorithms can be employed in order to estimate the systolic diastolic and mean arterial pressure oscillometric monitors may produce inaccurate readings in patients with heart and circulation problems which include arteriosclerosis arrhythmia preeclampsia pulsus alternans and pulsus paradoxus 49 54 in practice the different methods do not give identical results an algorithm and experimentally obtained coefficients are used to adjust the oscillometric results to give readings which match the auscultatory results as well as possible some equipment uses computer-aided analysis of the instantaneous arterial pressure waveform to determine the systolic mean and diastolic points since many oscillometric devices have not been validated caution must be given as most are not suitable in clinical and acute care settings recently several coefficient-free oscillometric algorithms have developed for estimation of blood pressure these algorithms do not rely on experimentally obtained coefficients and have been shown to provide more accurate and robust estimation of blood pressure these algorithms are based on finding the fundamental relationship between the oscillometric waveform and the blood pressure using modeling 55 56 and learning 57 approaches the term nibp for non-invasive blood pressure is often used to describe oscillometric monitoring equipment continuous noninvasive techniques cnapedit continuous noninvasive arterial pressure cnap is the method of measuring arterial blood pressure in real-time without any interruptions and without cannulating the human body cnap combines the advantages of the following two clinical gold standards it measures blood pressure continuously in real-time like the invasive arterial catheter system and it is noninvasive like the standard upper arm sphygmomanometer latest developments in this field show promising results in terms of accuracy ease of use and clinical acceptance non-occlusive techniques the pulse wave velocity pwv principleedit since the 1990s a novel family of techniques based on the so-called pulse wave velocity pwv principle have been developed these techniques rely on the fact that the velocity at which an arterial pressure pulse travels along the arterial tree depends among others on the underlying blood pressure 58 accordingly after a calibration maneuver these techniques provide indirect estimates of blood pressure by translating pwv values into blood pressure values 59 the main advantage of these techniques is that it is possible to measure pwv values of a subject continuously beat-by-beat without medical supervision and without the need of inflating brachial cuffs pwv-based techniques are still in the research domain and are not adapted to clinical settings ambulatory and home monitoringedit ambulatory blood pressure devices take readings regularly eg every half-hour throughout the day and night they have been used to exclude measurement problems like white-coat hypertension and provide more reliable estimates of usual blood pressure and cardiovascular risk blood pressure readings outside of a clinical setting are usually slightly lower in the majority of people however studies that quantified the risks from hypertension and the benefits of lowering blood pressure have mostly been based on readings in a clinical environment use of ambulatory measurements is not widespread but guidelines developed by the uk national institute for health and care excellence and the british hypertension society recommended that 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be used for diagnosis of hypertension 60 health economic analysis suggested that this approach would be cost effective compared with repeated clinic measurements 61 home monitoring is a cheap and simple alternative to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring although it does not usually allow assessment of blood pressure during sleep which may be a disadvantage 62 63 automatic self-contained blood pressure monitors are available at reasonable prices however measurements may not be accurate in patients with atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias such as frequent ectopic beats 62 63 home monitoring may be used to improve hypertension management and to monitor the effects of lifestyle changes and medication related to blood pressure 3 compared to ambulatory blood pressure measurements home monitoring has been found to be an effective and lower cost alternative 62 64 65 but ambulatory monitoring is more accurate than both clinic and home monitoring in diagnosing hypertension when measuring blood pressure in the home an accurate reading requires that one not drink coffee smoke cigarettes or engage in strenuous exercise for 30minutes before taking the reading a full bladder may have a small effect on blood pressure readings if the urge to urinate arises one should do so before the reading for 5minutes before the reading one should sit upright in a chair with ones feet flat on the floor and with limbs uncrossed the blood pressure cuff should always be against bare skin as readings taken over a shirt sleeve are less accurate the same arm should be used for all measurements during the reading the arm that is used should be relaxed and kept at heart level for example by resting it on a table 66 since blood pressure varies throughout the day home measurements should be taken at the same time of day a joint scientific statement from the american heart association american society of hypertension and preventive cardiovascular nurses association on home monitoring in 2008 63 recommended that 2 to 3 readings should be taken in the morning after awakening before washingdressing taking breakfastdrink or taking medication and another 2 to 3 readings at night each day over a period of 1 week it was also recommended that the readings from the first day should be discarded and that a total of ≥12 readings ie at least two readings per day for the remaining 6 days of the week should be used for making clinical decisions white-coat hypertensionedit for some patients blood pressure measurements taken in a doctors office may not correctly characterize their typical blood pressure 67 in up to 25 of patients the office measurement is higher than their typical blood pressure this type of error is called white-coat hypertension wch and can result from anxiety related to an examination by a health care professional 68 white coat hypertension can also occur because in a clinical setting patients are seldom given the opportunity to rest for five minutes before blood pressure readings are taken the misdiagnosis of hypertension for these patients can result in needless and possibly harmful medication wch can be reduced but not eliminated with automated blood pressure measurements over 15 to 20 minutes in a quiet part of the office or clinic 69 in some cases a lower blood pressure reading occurs at the doctors - this has been termed masked hypertension 70 blood pressure  take another person blood pressure  take your own blood pressure  take another person blood pressure  take your own invasiveedit arterial blood pressure is most accurately measured invasively through an arterial line invasive arterial pressure measurement with intravascular cannulae involves direct measurement of arterial pressure by placing a cannula needle in an artery usually radial femoral dorsalis pedis or brachial the cannula must be connected to a sterile fluid-filled system which is connected to an electronic pressure transducer the advantage of this system is that pressure is constantly monitored beat-by-beat and a waveform a graph of pressure against time can be displayed this invasive technique is regularly employed in human and veterinary intensive care medicine anesthesiology and for research purposes cannulation for invasive vascular pressure monitoring is infrequently associated with complications such as thrombosis infection and bleeding patients with invasive arterial monitoring require very close supervision as there is a danger of severe bleeding if the line becomes disconnected it is generally reserved for patients where rapid variations in arterial pressure are anticipated invasive vascular pressure monitors are pressure monitoring systems designed to acquire pressure information for display and processing there are a variety of invasive vascular pressure monitors for trauma critical care and operating room applications these include single pressure dual pressure and multi-parameter ie pressure  temperature the monitors can be used for measurement and follow-up of arterial central venous pulmonary arterial left atrial right atrial femoral arterial umbilical venous umbilical arterial and intracranial pressures fetal blood pressureedit in pregnancy it is the fetal heart and not the mothers heart that builds up the fetal blood pressure to drive blood through the fetal circulation the blood pressure in the fetal aorta is approximately 30mmhg at 20 weeks of gestation and increases to approximately 45mmhg at 40 weeks of gestation 71 the average blood pressure for full-term infants 72 systolic 65–95mmhg diastolic
