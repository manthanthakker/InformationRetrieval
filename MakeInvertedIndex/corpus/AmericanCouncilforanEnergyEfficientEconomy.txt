american council for an energy-efficient economy the american council for an energy-efficient economy or aceee is a nonprofit 501c 3 organization founded in 1980 aceees mission is to act as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies programs technologies investments and behaviors in order to help achieve greater economic prosperity energy security and environmental protection aceee promotes energy efficiency by conducting technical and policy analyses advising policymakers and program managers and working collaboratively with businesses government officials public interest groups and other organizations it convenes conferences and workshops primarily for energy efficiency professionals and produces reports books conference proceedings and media outreach 1 aceee employs more than 35 washington dc-based employees and holds field offices in delaware michigan washington and wisconsin the organizations primary focuses are on end-use efficiency in industry buildings utilities and transportation economic analysis and human behavior and state and national policy  contents 1 federal and state energy policy 1.1 federal policy 1.2 state policy 2 research and analysis 3 outreach 3.1 conferences 3.2 publications 3.3 the web 3.4 ally program 4 funding 5 see also 6 references 7 external links 1.1 federal policy 1.2 state policy 3.1 conferences 3.2 publications 3.3 the web 3.4 ally program  federal and state energy policyedit federal policyedit aceee has worked on federal energy policy since the 1980s the organization played central roles in the development of the national appliance energy conservation act of 1987 energy efficiency provisions in the energy policy act of 1992 and the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 it also played a role in the development of energy efficiency sections in recent farm bills many of these provisions were developed in cooperation with interested business and received bipartisan support aceee staff testify before congress and work closely with congressional staff in both parties to help shape new initiatives and analyze the impacts of energy and climate policy proposals they weigh in on the federal budget process promoting and increasing funding for what they deem the most effective energy efficiency programs the organization also works with federal agencies such as the environmental protection agency and the department of energy on programs and policies and participates in formal rulemakings on energy efficiency issues most of aceees federal policy work involves research and education however they do a limited amount of lobbying using unrestricted funds they supported the eps service parts act of 2014 hr 5057 113th congress a bill that would exempt certain external power supplies from complying with standards set forth in a final rule published by the united states department of energy in february 2014 2 3 the united states house committee on energy and commerce describes the bill as a bill that provides regulatory relief by making a simple technical correction to the 2007 energy independence and security act to exempt certain power supply eps service and spare parts from federal efficiency standards 4 state policyedit at the state level aceee works closely with public officials and local energy efficiency advocates providing advice analysis and technical support in order to maximize its impact the organization concentrates its efforts on large states that are poised to make major decisions on energy efficiency policy issues 5 for example in 2007 and 2008 it emphasized work in florida maryland michigan ohio pennsylvania texas and virginia all of these states passed significant energy efficiency legislation with additional legislation and regulations likely in some of them aceee also works on state policies that can potentially be adopted at the national level for example staff have worked with several states to develop state appliance and equipment efficiency standards which have subsequently been adopted by congress research and analysisedit aceee devotes much of its resources to research and analysis in order to discern the best technical program and policy practices that promote efficient energy use and to define the magnitude of benefits of energy efficiency research staff survey market trends and activities analyze technical and economic potential for energy efficiency seek to understand consumer energy decisions and assess the potential for regulations policies and programs to achieve energy savings aceees research programs include buildings and equipment - aceees oldest research program analyzes opportunities for energy efficiency in appliances and equipment building design construction and operation and programs and policies that encourage consumers to make energy-efficient product choices utilities - serves as the principal documenter and reviewer of publicly funded energy efficiency programs and supporting policies preparing regular surveys of best practices and supporting implementers and regulators in designing the next generation of programs and policies transportation - tracks vehicle technology and estimates the potential for future energy efficiency in addition the program explores technologies and policies that encourage changes in personal and freight transportation markets to further reduce energy use industry - applies unique experience in energy efficiency for the manufacturing sector including distributed energy resources such as combined heat and power and assesses technologies practices programs and policies to achieve increased energy efficiency in manufacturing agriculture - addresses the unique energy efficiency program and policy needs of farms and rural communities through assessment of energy use patterns and opportunities for more energy efficiency practices and technologies economic analysis - encourages the use of sound economic modeling practices studies the impacts of energy policies on the economy and projects the economic benefits of energy efficiency technologies practices and policies state analysis - cross-program effort that combines expertise from other research programs to assess state energy policies analyze the potential for energy efficiency at the state level and collect key resources to support state policymakers program implementers and efficiency advocates international - works with colleagues from transitional economies to adapt technology program and policy experiences from the united states to these economies outreachedit aceee attempts to reach out to and inform diverse audiences in a variety of ways conferencesedit aceee holds several conferences each year that aim to bring together disparate stakeholders to focus on multiple aspects of energy efficiency and the role it plays in addressing critical issues such as climate change energy resources utility structure and regulation and energy use in buildings industry and agriculture recent conferences include 2013 summer study on energy efficiency in industry 2012 summer study on energy efficiency in buildings hot water forum water heating distribution and use efficiency energy efficiency finance forum national symposium on market transformation forum on energy efficiency and agriculture behavior energy and climate change conference becc national conference on energy efficiency as a resource publicationsedit aceee provides research and technical analysis of current energy efficiency policies and practices as well as forecasting future trends these publications include research reports consumer books white papers legislative testimony and conference proceedings major recent aceee reports include energizing virginia efficiency first the size of the us energy efficiency market generating a more complete picture compendium of champions chronicling exemplary energy efficiency programs from across the us the 2008 state energy efficiency scorecard information and communication technologies the power of productivity assessment of the house renewable electricity standard and expanded clean energy scenarios the webedit aceee shares its work online by providing publications and conference presentations on the internet while not a consumer-focused organization aceee has several web resources devoted to educating consumers about making wise energy efficiency choices relating to their homes and their vehicles through consumer guide online based on consumer guide to home energy savings greenercarsorg online presence of aceees green book the environmental guide to cars and trucks ally programedit aceee convenes primary stakeholders in discussions and networking opportunities through policy briefings webinars covering recent published research and analysis and one-to-one interaction with staff and board members fundingedit aceees sources of funding from 2006 to 2007 were broken down as follows foundations  34 federal and state grants  7 specific contract work  21 conferences and publications  34 contributions and other  4 see alsoedit efficient energy use energy policy of the united states energy conservation in the united states john a skip laitner referencesedit external linksedit aceee appliance standards awareness project aceees green book reuters new york times chicago tribune npr
