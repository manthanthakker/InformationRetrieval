nuclear power 2012 world civil electricity generation by fuels iea 2014 4 nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear energy 5 to generate heat which most frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a nuclear power plant the term includes nuclear fission nuclear decay and nuclear fusion presently the nuclear fission of elements in the actinide series of the periodic table produce the vast majority of nuclear energy in the direct service of humankind with nuclear decay processes primarily in the form of geothermal energy and radioisotope thermoelectric generators in niche uses making up the rest fission-electric power stations are one of the leading low carbon power generation methods of producing electricity and in terms of total life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy generated has emission values lower than renewable energy when the latter is taken as a single energy source 6 7 as all electricity supplying technologies use cement etc during construction emissions are yet to be brought to zero a 2014 analysis of the carbon footprint literature by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reported that the embodied total life-cycle emission intensity of fission electricity has a median value of 12 g co2 eqkwh which is the lowest out of all commercial baseload energy sources 8 9 and second lowest out of all commercial electricity technologies known after wind power which is an intermittent energy source with embodied greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy generated of 11 g co2eqkwh each result is contrasted with coal  fossil gas at 820 and 490 g co2 eqkwh 8 9 with this translating into from the beginning of fission-electric power station commercialization in the 1970s having prevented the emission of about 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gases that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of fossil fuels in thermal power stations 10 there is a social debate about nuclear power 11 12 13 proponents such as the world nuclear association and environmentalists for nuclear energy contend that nuclear power is a safe sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions 14 opponents such as greenpeace international and nirs contend that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment 15 16 17 far-reaching fission power reactor accidents or accidents that resulted in medium to long-lived fission product contamination of inhabited areas have occurred in generation i  ii reactor designs blueprinted between 1950 and 1980 these include the chernobyl disaster which occurred in 1986 the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster  2011 and the more contained three mile island accident  1979 18 there have also been some nuclear submarine accidents 18 19 20 in terms of lives lost per unit of energy generated analysis has determined that fission-electric reactors have caused fewer fatalities per unit of energy generated than the other major sources of energy generation energy production from coal petroleum natural gas and hydroelectricity has caused a greater number of fatalities per unit of energy generated due to air pollution and energy accident effects 21 22 23 24 25 26 four years after the fukushima-daiichi accident there have been no fatalities due to exposure to radiation and no discernible increased incidence of radiation-related health effects are expected among exposed members of the public and their descendants 27 the japan times estimated 1,600 deaths were the result of evacuation due to physical and mental stress stemming from long stays at shelters a lack of initial care as a result of hospitals being disabled by the tsunami and suicides 28 in 2015 29 ten new reactors were connected to the grid seven reactors were permanently shut down 441 reactors had a worldwide net capacity of 382,855 megawatts of electricity 67 new nuclear reactors were under construction most of the new activity is in china where there is an urgent need to control pollution from coal plants 30 in october 2016 watts bar 2 became the first new united states reactor to enter

concepts 12.2 hybrid nuclear fusion-fission 12.3 nuclear fusion  history origins in 1932 physicist ernest rutherford discovered that when lithium atoms were split by protons from a proton accelerator immense amounts of energy were released in accordance with the principle of massenergy equivalence however he and other nuclear physics pioneers niels bohr and albert einstein believed harnessing the power of the atom for practical purposes anytime in the near future was unlikely with rutherford labeling such expectations moonshine 32 the same year his doctoral student james chadwick discovered the neutron 33 which was immediately recognized as a potential tool for nuclear experimentation because of its lack of an electric charge experimentation with bombardment of materials with neutrons led frédéric and irène joliot-curie to discover induced radioactivity in 1934 which allowed the creation of radium-like elements at much less the price of natural radium 34 further work by enrico fermi in the 1930s focused on using slow neutrons to increase the effectiveness of induced radioactivity experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons led fermi to believe he had created a new transuranic element which was dubbed hesperium 35 but in 1938 german chemists otto hahn 36 and fritz strassmann along with austrian physicist lise meitner 37 and meitners nephew otto robert frisch 38 conducted experiments with the products of neutron-bombarded uranium as a means of further investigating fermis claims they determined that the relatively tiny neutron split the nucleus of the massive uranium atoms into two roughly equal pieces contradicting fermi 35 this was an extremely surprising result all other forms of nuclear decay involved only small changes to the mass of the nucleus whereas this processdubbed fission as a reference to biologyinvolved a complete rupture of the nucleus numerous scientists including leó szilárd who was one of the first recognized that if fission reactions released additional neutrons a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction could result once this was experimentally confirmed and announced by frédéric joliot-curie in 1939 scientists in many countries including the united states the united kingdom france germany and the soviet union petitioned their governments for support of nuclear fission research just on the cusp of world war ii for the development of a nuclear weapon 39 in the united states where fermi and szilárd had both emigrated this led to the creation of the first man-made reactor known as chicago pile-1 which achieved criticality on december 2 1942 this work became part of the manhattan project which made enriched uranium and built large reactors to breed plutonium for use in the first nuclear weapons which were used on the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 the pocketbook the atomic age heralded the untapped atomic power in everyday objects and depicted a future where fossil fuels would go unused one science writer david dietz wrote that instead of filling the gas tank of your car two or three times a week you will travel for a year on a pellet of atomic energy the size of a vitamin pill glenn seaborg who chaired the atomic energy commission wrote there will be nuclear powered earth-to-moon shuttles nuclear powered artificial hearts plutonium heated swimming pools for scuba divers and much more these overly optimistic predications remain unfulfilled 40 united kingdom canada 41 and ussr proceeded over the course of the late 1940s and early 1950s electricity was generated for the first time by a nuclear reactor on december 20 1951 at the ebr-i experimental station near arco idaho which initially produced about 100kw 42 43 work was also strongly researched in the us on nuclear marine propulsion with a test reactor being developed by 1953 eventually the uss nautilus the first nuclear-powered submarine would launch in 1955 44 in 1953 us president dwight eisenhower gave his atoms for peace speech at the united nations emphasizing the need to develop peaceful uses of nuclear power quickly this was followed by the 1954 amendments to the atomic energy act which allowed rapid declassification of us reactor technology and encouraged development by the private sector early years on june 27 1954 the ussrs obninsk nuclear power plant became the worlds first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a power grid and produced around 5 megawatts of electric power 45 46 later in 1954 lewis strauss then chairman of the united states atomic energy commission us aec forerunner of the us nuclear regulatory commission and the united states department of energy spoke of electricity in the future being too cheap to meter 47 strauss was very likely referring to hydrogen fusion 48 which was secretly being developed as part of project sherwood at the timebut strausss statement was interpreted as a promise of very cheap energy from nuclear fission the us aec itself had issued far more realistic testimony regarding nuclear fission to the us congress only months before projecting that costs can be brought down to about the same as the cost of electricity from conventional sources 49 in 1955 the united nations first geneva conference then the worlds largest gathering of scientists and engineers met to explore the technology in 1957 euratom was launched alongside the european economic community the latter is now the european union the same year also saw the launch of the international atomic energy agency iaea the worlds first commercial nuclear power station calder hall at windscale england was opened in 1956 with an initial capacity of 50 mw later 200 mw 50 51 the first commercial nuclear generator to become operational in the united states was the shippingport reactor pennsylvania december 1957 one of the first organizations to develop nuclear power was the us navy for the purpose of propelling submarines and aircraft carriers the first nuclear-powered submarine ussnautilusssn-571 was put to sea in december 1954 52 as of 2016 the us navy submarine fleet is made up entirely of nuclear-powered vessels with 75 submarines in service two us nuclear submarines ussscorpion and ussthresher have been lost at sea the russian navy is currently  2016 estimated to have 61 nuclear submarines in service eight soviet and russian nuclear submarines have been lost at sea this includes the soviet submarine k-19 reactor accident in 1961 which resulted in 8 deaths and more than 30 other people were over-exposed to radiation 19 the soviet submarine k-27 reactor accident in 1968 resulted in 9 fatalities and 83 other injuries 20 moreover soviet submarine k-429 sank twice but was raised after each incident several serious nuclear and radiation accidents have involved nuclear submarine mishaps 18 20 the us army also had a nuclear power program beginning in 1954 the sm-1 nuclear power plant at fort belvoir virginia was the first power reactor in the us to supply electrical energy to a commercial grid vepco in april 1957 before shippingport the sl-1 was a us army experimental nuclear power reactor at the national reactor testing station in eastern idaho it underwent a steam explosion and meltdown in january 1961 which killed its three operators 53 in soviet union in the mayak production association there were a number of accidents including an explosion that released 50-100 tonnes of high-level radioactive waste contaminating a huge territory in the eastern urals and causing numerous deaths and injuries the soviet regime kept this accident secret for about 30 years the event was eventually rated at 6 on the seven-level ines scale third in severity only to the disasters at chernobyl and fukushima development installed nuclear capacity initially rose relatively quickly rising from less than 1 gigawatt gw in 1960 to 100 gw in the late 1970s and 300 gw in the late 1980s since the late 1980s worldwide capacity has risen much more slowly reaching 366 gw in 2005 between around 1970 and 1990 more than 50 gw of capacity was under construction peaking at over 150 gw in the late 1970s and early 1980s  in 2005 around 25 gw of new capacity was planned more than two-thirds of all nuclear plants ordered after january 1970 were eventually cancelled 52 a total of 63 nuclear units were canceled in the usa between 1975 and 1980 54 during the 1970s and 1980s rising economic costs related to extended construction times largely due to regulatory changes and pressure-group litigation 55 and falling fossil fuel prices made nuclear power plants then under construction less attractive in the 1980s us and 1990s europe flat load growth and electricity liberalization also made the addition of large new baseload capacity unattractive the 1973 oil crisis had a significant effect on countries such as france and japan which had relied more heavily on oil for electric generation  39 56 and 73 respectively to invest in nuclear power 57 some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in the early 1960s 58 and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns 59 these concerns related to nuclear accidents nuclear proliferation high cost of nuclear power plants nuclear terrorism and radioactive waste disposal 60 in the early 1970s there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in wyhl germany the project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of europe and north america 61 62 by the mid-1970s anti-nuclear activism had moved beyond local protests and politics to gain a wider appeal and influence and nuclear power became an issue of major public protest 63 although it lacked a single co-ordinating organization and did not have uniform goals the movements efforts gained a great deal of attention 64 in some countries the nuclear power conflict reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies 65 in france between 1975 and 1977 some 175,000 people protested against nuclear power in ten demonstrations 66 in west germany between february 1975 and april 1979 some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites several site occupations were also attempted in the aftermath of the three mile island accident in 1979 some 120,000 people attended a demonstration against nuclear power in bonn 66 in may 1979 an estimated 70,000 people including then governor of california jerry brown attended a march and rally against nuclear power in washington dc 67 anti-nuclear power groups emerged in every country that has had a nuclear power programme three mile island and chernobyl health and safety concerns the 1979 accident at three mile island and the 1986 chernobyl disaster played a part in stopping new plant construction in many countries 59 although the public policy organization the brookings institution states that new nuclear units at the time of publishing in 2006 had not been built in the us because of soft demand for electricity and cost overruns on nuclear plants due to regulatory issues and construction delays 68 by the end of the 1970s it became clear that nuclear power would not grow nearly as dramatically as once believed eventually more than 120 reactor orders in the us were ultimately cancelled 69 and the construction of new reactors ground to a halt a cover story in the february 11 1985 issue of forbes magazine commented on the overall failure of the us nuclear power program saying it ranks as the largest managerial disaster in business history 70 unlike the three mile island accident the much more serious chernobyl accident did not increase regulations affecting western reactors since the chernobyl reactors were of the problematic rbmk design only used in the soviet union for example lacking robust containment buildings 71 many of these rbmk reactors are still in use today however changes were made in both the reactors themselves use of a safer enrichment of uranium and in the control system prevention of disabling safety systems amongst other things to reduce the possibility of a duplicate accident 72 an international organization to promote safety awareness and professional development on operators in nuclear facilities was created wano world association of nuclear operators opposition in ireland and poland prevented nuclear programs there while austria  1978 sweden  1980 and italy  1987 influenced by chernobyl voted in referendums to oppose or phase out nuclear power in july 2009 the italian parliament passed a law that cancelled the results of an earlier referendum and allowed the immediate start of the italian nuclear program 73 after the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster a one-year moratorium was placed on nuclear power development 74 followed by a referendum in which over 94 of voters turnout 57 rejected plans for new nuclear power 75 nuclear renaissance since about 2001 the term nuclear renaissance has been used to refer to a possible nuclear power industry revival driven by rising fossil fuel prices and new concerns about meeting greenhouse gas emission limits 81 in 2012 the world nuclear association reported that nuclear electricity generation was at its lowest level since 1999 82 as of january 2016 however 65 new nuclear power reactors were under construction over 150 were planned equivalent to nearly half of capacity at that time 83 fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster japans 2011 fukushima daiichi nuclear accident which occurred in a reactor design from the 1960s prompted a re-examination of nuclear safety and nuclear energy policy in many countries 84 germany plans to close all its reactors by 2022 and italy has re-affirmed its ban on electric utilities generating but not importing fission derived electricity 84 in 2011 the international energy agency halved its prior estimate of new generating capacity to be built by 2035 85 86 in 2013 japan signed a deal worth $22 billion in which mitsubishi heavy industries would build four modern atmea reactors for turkey 87 in august 2015 following 4 years of near zero fission-electricity generation japan began restarting its fission fleet after safety upgrades were completed beginning with sendai fission-electric station 88 in march 2011 the nuclear emergencies at japans fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant and shutdowns at other nuclear facilities raised questions among some commentators over the future of the renaissance 89 90 91 92 93 china germany switzerland israel malaysia thailand united kingdom italy 94 and the philippines have reviewed their nuclear power programs indonesia and vietnam still plan to build nuclear power plants 95 96 97 98 the world nuclear association has said that nuclear power generation suffered its biggest ever one-year fall through 2012 as the bulk of the japanese fleet remained offline for a full calendar year data from the international atomic energy agency showed that nuclear power plants globally produced 2346 twh of electricity in 2012  seven per cent less than in 2011 the figures illustrate the effects of a full year of 48 japanese power reactors producing no power during the year the permanent closure of eight reactor units in germany was also a factor problems at crystal river fort calhoun and the two san onofre units in the usa meant they produced no power for the full year while in belgium doel 3 and tihange 2 were out of action for six months compared to 2010 the nuclear industry produced 11 less electricity in 2012 82 post-fukushima controversy the fukushima daiichi nuclear accident sparked controversy about the importance of the accident and its effect on nuclears future iaea director general yukiya amano said the japanese nuclear accident caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power 99 and the international energy agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035 85 86 but by 2015 the agencys outlook had become more promising nuclear power is a critical element in limiting greenhouse gas emissions the agency noted and the prospects for nuclear energy remain positive in the medium to long term despite a negative impact in some countries in the aftermath of the fukushima-daiichi accidentit is still the second-largest source worldwide of low-carbon electricity and the 72 reactors under construction at the start of last year were the most in 25 years 100 though platts reported in 2011 that the crisis at japans fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world 101 progress energy chairmanceo bill johnson made the observation that today theres an even more compelling case that greater use of nuclear power is a vital part of a balanced energy strategy 102 in 2011 the economist opined that nuclear power looks dangerous unpopular expensive and risky and that it is replaceable with relative ease and could be forgone with no huge structural shifts in the way the world works 103 earth institute director jeffrey sachs disagreed claiming combating climate change would require an expansion of nuclear power we wont meet the carbon targets if nuclear is taken off the table he said we need to understand the scale of the challenge 104 investment banks were critical of nuclear soon after the accident many disputed their impartiality however due to significant investments in renewable energy perceived by some as a valid alternative to nuclear in early april 2011 analysts at swiss-based investment bank ubs said at fukushima four reactors have been out of control for weeks casting doubt on whether even an advanced economy can master nuclear safetywe believe the fukushima accident was the most serious ever for the credibility of nuclear power 105 ubs has helped to raise more than $20 billion since 2006 and advised on more than a dozen deals for renewable energy and cleantech companies 106 deutsche bank advised that the global impact of the fukushima accident is a fundamental shift in public perception with regard to how a nation prioritizes and values its populations health safety security and natural environment when determining its current and future energy pathwaysrenewable energy will be a clear long-term winner in most energy systems a conclusion supported by many voter surveys conducted over the past few weeks 107 deutsche bank has over €1 billion in capital invested in renewables projects in europe north  south america and asia 108 manufacturers also recognized a profit opportunity in negative public perceptions about nuclear in september 2011 german engineering giant siemens announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry as a response to the fukushima nuclear accident in japan and said that it would no longer build nuclear power plants anywhere in the world the companys chairman peter löscher said that siemens was ending plans to cooperate with rosatom the russian state-controlled nuclear power company in the construction of dozens of nuclear plants throughout russia over the coming two decades 109 110 renewable energy is a core component of siemenss profit base in february 2016 the firm proposed a €10 billion renewable energy investment in egypt 111 in february 2012 the united states nuclear regulatory commission approved the construction of two additional reactors at the vogtle electric generating plant the first reactors to be approved in over 30 years since the three mile island accident 112 but nrc chairman gregory jaczko cast a dissenting vote citing safety concerns stemming from japans 2011 fukushima nuclear disaster and saying i cannot support issuing this license as if fukushima never happened 113 jaczko resigned in april 2012 one week after southern received the license to begin major construction on the two new reactors a dozen environmental and anti-nuclear groups sued to stop the plant vogtle expansion project saying public safety and environmental problems since japans fukushima daiichi nuclear reactor accident have not been taken into account 114 in july 2012 the suit was rejected by the washington dc circuit court of appeals 115 countries such as australia austria denmark greece ireland italy latvia liechtenstein luxembourg malta portugal israel malaysia new zealand and norway have no nuclear power reactors and remain opposed to nuclear power 103 116 however by contrast some countries remain in favor and financially support nuclear fusion research including eu wide funding of the iter project 117 118 industry companies capacity and production nuclear power capacity remained relatively stable between the mid 1980s until the accident at the fukushima daiichi reactor in march 2011 119 in june 2015 platts reported global nuclear generation increased by 1 in 2014 the first annual increase since fukushima 120 the united states produces the most nuclear energy with nuclear power providing 19 121 of the electricity it consumes while france produces the highest percentage of its electrical energy from nuclear reactors—80 as of 2006 122 in the european union as a whole nuclear energy provides 30 of the electricity 123 nuclear energy policy differs among european union countries and some such as austria estonia ireland and italy have no active nuclear power stations in comparison france has a large number of these plants with 16 multi-unit stations in current use many military and some civilian such as some icebreaker ships use nuclear marine propulsion a form of nuclear propulsion 124 a few space vehicles have been launched using full-fledged nuclear reactors 33 reactors belong to the soviet rorsat series and one was the american snap-10a international research is continuing into safety improvements such as passively safe plants 125 the use of nuclear fusion and additional uses of process heat such as hydrogen production in support of a hydrogen economy for desalinating sea water and for use in district heating systems nuclear fission power stations excluding the contribution from naval nuclear fission reactors provided 11 of the worlds electricity in 2012 126 somewhat less than that generated by hydro-electric stations at 16 since electricity accounts for about 25 of humanitys energy usage with the majority of the rest coming from fossil fuel reliant sectors such as transport manufacture and home heating nuclear fissions contribution to the global final energy consumption is about 2.5 127 a little more than the combined global electricity production from new renewables wind solar biofuel and geothermal power which together provided 2 of global final energy consumption in 2014 128 regional differences in the use of fission energy are large fission energy generation with a 20 share of the us electricity production is the single largest deployed technology among current low-carbon power sources in the country 129 in addition two-thirds of the european unions twenty-seven nations low-carbon energy is produced by fission 130 some of these nations have banned its generation such as italy which ended the use of fission-electric generation which started in 1963 in 1990 france is the largest user of nuclear energy deriving 75 of its electricity from fission in 2013 the iaea reported that there were 437operational civil fission-electric reactors 131 in 31countries 132 although not every reactor was producing electricity 133 in addition there were approximately 140 naval vessels using nuclear propulsion in operation powered by some 180 reactors 134 135 136 as of 2013 attaining a net energy gain from sustained nuclear fusion reactions excluding natural fusion power sources such as the sun remains an ongoing area of international physics and engineering research with commercial fusion power production remaining unlikely before 2050 137 since commercial nuclear energy began in the mid-1950s 2008 was the first year that no new nuclear power plant was connected to the grid although two were connected in 2009 138 139 in 2015 the iaea reported that worldwide there were 67 civil fission-electric power reactors under construction in 15 countries including gulf states such as the united arab emirates uae 131 over half of the 67 total being built were in asia with 28 in china eight new grid connections were completed by china in 2015 140 141 and the most recently completed reactor to be connected to the electrical grid as of january 2016 was at the kori nuclear power plant in the republic of korea 142 143 in the us four new generation iii reactors were under construction at vogtle and summer station while a fifth was nearing completion at watts bar station all five were expected to become operational before 2020 113 in 2013 four aging uncompetitive us reactors were closed 144 145 according to the world nuclear association the global trend is for new nuclear power stations coming online to be balanced by the number of old plants being retired 146 analysis in 2015 by professor and chair of environmental sustainability barry w brook and his colleagues on the topic of replacing fossil fuels entirely from the electric grid of the world has determined that at the historically modest and proven-rate at which nuclear energy was added to and replaced fossil fuels in france and sweden during each nations building programs in the 1980s within 10 years nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely allowing the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets 147 in a similar analysis brook had earlier determined that 50 of all global energy that is not solely electricity but transportation synfuels etc could be generated within approximately 30 years if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to each of these nations already proven decadal ratesin units of installed nameplate capacity gw per year per unit of global gdpgwyear 148 this is in contrast to the completely conceptual paper-studies for a 100 renewable energy world which would require an orders of magnitude more costly global investment per year which has no historical precedent having never been attempted due to its prohibitive cost 149 150 along with far greater land that would need to be devoted to the wind wave and solar projects and the inherent assumption that humanity will use less and not more energy in the future 151 152 153 as brook notes the principal limitations on nuclear fission are not technical economic or fuel-related but are instead linked to complex issues of societal acceptance fiscal and political inertia and inadequate critical evaluation of the real-world constraints facing the other low-carbon alternatives 154 economics nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant but low fuel costs although nuclear power plants can vary their output the electricity is generally less favorably priced when doing so nuclear power plants are therefore typically run as much as possible to keep the cost of the generated electrical energy as low as possible supplying mostly base-load electricity 157 internationally the price of nuclear plants rose 15 annually in 1970-1990 158pageneeded yet nuclear power has total costs in 2012 of about $96 per megawatt hour mwh most of which involves capital construction costs compared with solar power at $130 per mwh and natural gas at the low end at $64 per mwh 159 in 2015 the bulletin of the atomic scientists unveiled the nuclear fuel cycle cost calculator an online tool that estimates the full cost of electricity produced by three configurations of the nuclear fuel cycle two years in the making this interactive calculator is the first generally accessible model to provide a nuanced look at the economic costs of nuclear power it lets users test how sensitive the price of electricity is to a full range of componentsmore than 60 parameters that can be adjusted for the three configurations of the nuclear fuel cycle considered by this tool once-through limited-recycle full-recycle users can select the fuel cycle they would like to examine change cost estimates for each component of that cycle and even choose uncertainty ranges for the cost of particular components this approach allows users around the world to compare the cost of different nuclear power approaches in a sophisticated way while taking account of prices relevant to their own countries or regions in recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth 160 in eastern europe a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance notably belene in bulgaria and the additional reactors at cernavoda in romania and some potential backers have pulled out 160 where the electricity market is competitive cheap natural gas is available and its future supply relatively secure this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects 160 and existing plants 161 analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties to date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by state-owned or regulated utility monopolies 162 where many of the risks associated with construction costs operating performance fuel price accident liability and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers in addition because the potential liability from a nuclear accident is so great the full cost of liability insurance is generally limitedcapped by the government which the us nuclear regulatory commission concluded constituted a significant subsidy 163 many countries have now liberalized the electricity market where these risks and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants 164 following the 2011 fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster costs are expected to increase for currently operating and new nuclear power plants due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats 165 the economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject since there are diverging views on this topic and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants as well as the future costs of fossil fuels and renewables as well as for energy storage solutions for intermittent power sources cost estimates also need to take into account plant decommissioning and nuclear waste storage costs on the other hand measures to mitigate global warming such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading may favor the economics of nuclear powercitation needed nuclear power organizations there are multiple organizations which have taken a position on nuclear power and the nuclear power industry some are proponents and some are opponents proponents the majority of pro-nuclear energy organizations and associations is either industry-supported or directly formed from industry members as advocacy groups or trade associations environmentalists for nuclear energy international nuclear industry association united kingdom

environmental research united states sayonara nuclear power plants japan categoryanti-nuclear organizations future of the industry the future of nuclear power varies greatly between countries depending on government policies some countries many of them in europe such as germany belgium and lithuania have adopted policies of nuclear power phase-out at the same time some asian countries such as china 173 south korea 174 and india 175 have committed to rapid expansion of nuclear power many other countries such as the united kingdom 176 and the united states have policies in between japan was a major generator of nuclear power before the fukushima accident but as of august 2016 japan has restarted only three of its nuclear plants and the extent to which it will resume its nuclear program is uncertain 177 in 2015 the international energy agency reported that the fukushima accident had a strongly negative effect on nuclear power yet the prospects for nuclear energy remain positive in the medium to long term despite a negative impact in some countries in the aftermath of the accident the iea noted that at the start of 2014 there were 72 nuclear reactors under construction worldwide the largest number in 25 years and that china planned to increase nuclear power capacity from 17 gigawatts gw in 2014 to 58 gw in 2020 178 in 2016 the us energy information administration projected for its base case that world nuclear power generation would increase from 2,344 billion kw-hr in 2012 to 4,501 billion kw-hr in 2040 most of the predicted increase was expected to be in asia 179 the nuclear power industry in western nations has a history of construction delays cost overruns plant cancellations and nuclear safety issues despite significant government subsidies and support 70 180 181 182 in december 2013 forbes magazine cited a report which concluded that in western countries reactors are not a viable source of new power 183 even where they make economic sense they are not feasible because nuclears enormous costs political and popular opposition and regulatory uncertainty 183 this view echoes the statement of former exelon ceo john rowe who said in 2012 that new nuclear plants in the united states dont make any sense right now and wont be economically viable in the foreseeable future 183 john quiggin economics professor also says the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically-viable quiggin says that we need more efficient energy use and more renewable energy commercialization 155 former nrc member peter bradford and professor ian lowe made similar statements in 2011 184 185 however some nuclear cheerleaders and lobbyists in the west continue to champion reactors often with proposed new but largely untested designs as a source of new power 183 184 186 187 188 189 190 much more new build activity is occurring in developing countries like south korea india and china in march 2016 china had 30 reactors in operation 24 under construction and plans to build more 191 192 193 however according to a government research unit china must not build too many nuclear power reactors too quickly in order to avoid a shortfall of fuel equipment and qualified plant workers 194 in the us licenses of almost half its reactors have been extended to 60years 195 196 two new generation iii reactors are under construction at vogtle a dual construction project which marks the end of a 34-year period of stagnation in the us construction of civil nuclear power reactors the station operator licenses of almost half the present 104 power reactors in the us as of 2008 have been given extensions to 60years 195 as of 2012 us nuclear industry officials expect five new reactors to enter service by 2020 all at existing plants 113 in 2013 four aging uncompetitive reactors were permanently closed 144 145 relevant state legislatures are trying to close vermont yankee and indian point nuclear power plant 145 the us nrc and the us department of energy have initiated research into light water reactor sustainability which is hoped will lead to allowing extensions of reactor licenses beyond 60 years provided that safety can be maintained as the loss in non-co2-emitting generation capacity by retiring reactors may serve to challenge us energy security potentially resulting in increased greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to an imbalance between electric supply and demand 197 there is a possible impediment to production of nuclear power plants as only a few companies worldwide have the capacity to forge single-piece reactor pressure vessels 198 which are necessary in the most common reactor designs utilities across the world are submitting orders years in advance of any actual need for these vessels other manufacturers are examining various options including making the component themselves or finding ways to make a similar item using alternate methods 199 according to the world nuclear association globally during the 1980s one new nuclear reactor started up every 17days on average and in the year 2015 it was estimated that this rate could in theory eventually increase to one every 5days although no plans exist for that 200 as of 2007 watts bar 1 in tennessee which came on-line on february 7 1996 was the last us commercial nuclear reactor to go on-line this is often quoted as evidence of a successful worldwide campaign for nuclear power phase-out 201 electricity shortages fossil fuel price increases global warming and heavy metal emissions from fossil fuel use new technology such as passively safe plants and national energy security may renew the demand for nuclear power plants nuclear power plant just as many conventional thermal power stations generate electricity by harnessing the thermal energy released from burning fossil fuels nuclear power plants convert the energy released from the nucleus of an atom via nuclear fission that takes place in a nuclear reactor the heat is removed from the reactor core by a cooling system that uses the heat to generate steam which drives a steam turbine connected to a generator producing electricity life cycle of nuclear fuel a nuclear reactor is only part of the life-cycle for nuclear power the process starts with mining see uranium mining uranium mines are underground open-pit or in-situ leach mines in any case the uranium ore is extracted usually converted into a stable and compact form such as yellowcake and then transported to a processing facility here the yellowcake is converted to uranium hexafluoride which is then enriched using various techniques at this point the enriched uranium containing more than the natural 0.7 u-235 is used to make rods of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is destined for the fuel rods will spend about 3 operational cycles typically 6 years total now inside the reactor generally until about 3 of their uranium has been fissioned then they will be moved to a spent fuel pool where the short lived isotopes generated by fission can decay away after about 5 years in a spent fuel pool the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally cool enough to handle and it can be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed conventional fuel resources uranium is a fairly common element in the earths crust uranium is approximately as common as tin or germanium in the earths crust and is about 40times more common than silver 202 uranium is present in trace concentrations in most rocks dirt and ocean water but can be economically extracted currently only only where it is present in high concentrations still the worlds present measured resources of uranium economically recoverable at the arbitrary price ceiling of 130usdkg are enough to last for between 70 and 100 years 203 204 205 according to the oecd in 2006 there was an expected 85 years worth of uranium in already identified resources when that uranium is used in present reactor technology in the oecds red book of 2011 due to increased exploration known uranium resources have grown by 12.5 since 2008 with this increase translating into greater than a century of uranium available if the metals usage rate were to continue at the 2011 level 206 207 the oecd also estimate 670 years of economically recoverable uranium in total conventional resources and phosphate ores while also using present reactor technology a resource that is recoverable from between 60-100 uskg of uranium 208 in a similar manner to every other natural metal resource for every tenfold increase in the cost per kilogram of uranium there is a three-hundred fold increase in available lower quality ores that would then become economical 209 as the oecd note even if the nuclear industry expands significantly sufficient fuel is available for centuries if advanced breeder reactors could be designed in the future to efficiently utilize recycled or depleted uranium and all actinides then the resource utilization efficiency would be further improved by an additional factor of eight for example the oecd have determined that with a pure fast reactor fuel cycle with a burn up of and recycling of all the uranium and actinides actinides which presently make up the most hazardous substances in nuclear waste there is 160,000 years worth of uranium in total conventional resources and phosphate ore at the price of 60-100 uskg of uranium 210 current light water reactors make relatively inefficient use of nuclear fuel mostly fissioning only the very rare uranium-235 isotope nuclear reprocessing can make this waste reusable and more efficient reactor designs such as the currently under construction generation iii reactors achieve a higher efficiency burn up of the available resources than the current vintage generation ii reactors which make up the vast majority of reactors worldwide 211 breeding as opposed to current light water reactors which use uranium-235  0.7 of all natural uranium fast breeder reactors use uranium-238  99.3 of all natural uranium it has been estimated that there is up to five billion years worth of uranium-238 for use in these power plants 212 breeder technology has been used in several reactors but the high cost of reprocessing fuel safely at 2006 technological levels requires uranium prices of more than 200 usdkg before becoming justified economically 213 breeder reactors are still however being pursued as they have the potential to burn up all of the actinides in the present inventory of nuclear waste while also producing power and creating additional quantities of fuel for more reactors via the breeding process 214 215 in 2005 there were two breeder reactors producing power the phénix in france which has since powered down in 2009 after 36 years of operation and the bn-600 reactor a reactor constructed in 1980 beloyarsk russia which is still operational as of 2013 the electricity output of bn-600 is 600 mw  russia plans to expand the nations use of breeder reactors with the bn-800 reactor was scheduled to become operational in 2014 216 but due to delays is not scheduled to produce power until 2017 217 the technical design of a yet larger breeder the bn-1200 reactor was originally scheduled to be finalized in 2013 with construction slated for 2015 but has also been delayed 218 japans monju breeder reactor restarted having been shut down in 1995 in 2010 for 3 months but shut down again after equipment fell into the reactor during reactor checkups it is planned to become re-operational in late 2013 219 both china and india are building breeder reactors with the indian 500 mwe prototype fast breeder reactor scheduled to become operational in 2014 with plans to build five more by 2020 220 the china experimental fast reactor began producing power in 2011 221 another alternative to fast breeders is thermal breeder reactors that use uranium-233 bred from thorium as fission fuel in the thorium fuel cycle thorium is about 3.5 times more common than uranium in the earths crust and has different geographic characteristics this would extend the total practical fissionable resource base by 450 222 indias three-stage nuclear power programme features the use of a thorium fuel cycle in the third stage as it has abundant thorium reserves but little uranium solid waste the most important waste stream from nuclear power plants is spent nuclear fuel it is primarily composed of unconverted uranium as well as significant quantities of transuranic actinides plutonium and curium mostly in addition about 3 of it is fission products from nuclear reactions the actinides uranium plutonium and curium are responsible for the bulk of the long-term radioactivity whereas the fission products are responsible for the bulk of the short-term radioactivity 223 high-level radioactive waste high-level radioactive waste management concerns management and disposal of highly radioactive materials created during production of nuclear power the technical issues in accomplishing this are daunting due to the extremely long periods radioactive wastes remain deadly to living organisms of particular concern are two long-lived fission products technetium-99 half-life 220,000 years and iodine-129 half-life 15.7 million years 226 which dominate spent nuclear fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years the most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are neptunium-237 half-life two million years and plutonium-239 half-life 24,000 years 227 consequently high-level radioactive waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from the biosphere this usually necessitates treatment followed by a long-term management strategy involving permanent storage disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form 228 governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options usually involving deep-geologic placement although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions 229 this is partly because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years 230 231 according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses 232 some proposed nuclear reactor designs however such as the american integral fast reactor and the molten salt reactor can use the nuclear waste from light water reactors as a fuel transmutating it to isotopes that would be safe after hundreds instead of tens of thousands of years this offers a potentially more attractive alternative to deep geological disposal 233 234 235 another possibility is the use of thorium in a reactor especially designed for thorium rather than mixing in thorium with uranium and plutonium ie in existing reactors used thorium fuel remains only a few hundreds of years radioactive instead of tens of thousands of years 236 since the fraction of a radioisotopes atoms decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to its half-life the relative radioactivity of a quantity of buried human radioactive waste would diminish over time compared to natural radioisotopes such as the decay chains of 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium which are at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each over the crusts 3  1019 ton mass 237 238 239 for instance over a timeframe of thousands of years after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed burying us nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the united states  10 million km2 by  1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of natural radioisotopes in such a volume although the vicinity of the site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average 240 low-level radioactive waste the nuclear industry also produces a large volume of low-level radioactive waste in the form of contaminated items like clothing hand tools water purifier resins and upon decommissioning the materials of which the reactor itself is built in the us the nuclear regulatory commission has repeatedly attempted to allow low-level materials to be handled as normal waste landfilled recycled into consumer items etcetera comparing radioactive waste to industrial toxic waste in countries with nuclear power radioactive wastes comprise less than 1 of total industrial toxic wastes much of which remains hazardous for long periods 211 overall nuclear power produces far less waste material by volume than fossil-fuel based power plants 241 coal-burning plants are particularly noted for producing large amounts of toxic and mildly radioactive ash due to concentrating naturally occurring metals and mildly radioactive material from the coal 242 a 2008 report from oak ridge national laboratory concluded that coal power actually results in more radioactivity being released into the environment than nuclear power operation and that the population effective dose equivalent or dose to the public from radiation from coal plants is 100 times as much as from the operation of nuclear plants 243 indeed coal ash is much less radioactive than spent nuclear fuel on a weight per weight basis but coal ash is produced in much higher quantities per unit of energy generated and this is released directly into the environment as fly ash whereas nuclear plants use shielding to protect the environment from radioactive materials for example in dry cask storage vessels 244 waste disposal disposal of nuclear waste is often said to be the achilles heel of the industry 245 presently waste is mainly stored at individual reactor sites and there are over 430 locations around the world where radioactive material continues to accumulate some experts suggest that centralized underground repositories which are well-managed guarded and monitored would be a vast improvement 245 there is an international consensus on the advisability of storing nuclear waste in deep geological repositories 246 with the lack of movement of nuclear waste in the 2 billion year old natural nuclear fission reactors in oklo gabon being cited as a source of essential information today 247 248 there are no commercial scale purpose built underground repositories in operation 246 249 250 251 the waste isolation pilot plant wipp in new mexico has been taking nuclear waste since 1999 from production reactors but as the name suggests is a research and development facility a radiation leak at wipp in 2014 brought renewed attention to the need for rd on disposal or radioactive waste and spent fuel 252 reprocessing reprocessing can potentially recover up to 95 of the remaining uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuel putting it into new mixed oxide fuel this produces a reduction in long term radioactivity within the remaining waste since this is largely short-lived fission products and reduces its volume by over 90 reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in europe russia japan and india the full potential of reprocessing has not been achieved because it requires breeder reactors which are not commercially available 253 254 nuclear reprocessing reduces the volume of high-level waste but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism the political challenges of repository siting a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle several different methods for reprocessing been tried but many have had safety and practicality problems which have led to their discontinuation 253 255 in the united states the obama administration stepped back from president bushs plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research 256 reprocessing is not allowed in the us 257 258 in the us spent nuclear fuel is currently all treated as waste 259 a major recommendation of the blue ribbon commission on americas nuclear future was that the united states should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste 260 depleted uranium uranium enrichment produces many tons of depleted uranium du which consists of u-238 with most of the easily fissile u-235 isotope removed u-238 is a tough metal with several commercial usesfor example aircraft production radiation shielding and armoras it has a higher density than lead depleted uranium is also controversially used in munitions du penetrators bullets or apfsds tips self sharpen due to uraniums tendency to fracture along shear bands 261 262 accidents attacks and safety accidents some serious nuclear and radiation accidents have occurred benjamin k sovacool has reported that worldwide there have been 99 accidents at nuclear power plants 265 fifty-seven accidents have occurred since the chernobyl disaster and 57  56 out of 99 of all nuclear-related accidents have occurred in the usa 265 266 nuclear power plant accidents include the chernobyl accident  1986 with approximately 60 deaths so far attributed to the accident and a predicted eventual total death toll of from 4000 to 25,000 latent cancers deaths the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster  2011 has not caused any radiation related deaths with a predicted eventual total death toll of from 0 to 1000 and the three mile island accident  1979 no causal deaths cancer or otherwise have been found in follow up studies of this accident 18 nuclear-powered submarine mishaps include the k-19 reactor accident  1961 19 the k-27 reactor accident  1968 20 and the k-431 reactor accident  1985 18 international research is continuing into safety improvements such as passively safe plants 125 and the possible future use of nuclear fusion in terms of lives lost per unit of energy generated nuclear power has caused fewer accidental deaths per unit of energy generated than all other major sources of energy generation energy produced by coal petroleum natural gas and hydropower has caused more deaths per unit of energy generated from air pollution and energy accidents this is found in the following comparisons when the immediate nuclear related deaths from accidents are compared to the immediate deaths from these other energy sources 23 when the latent or predicted indirect cancer deaths from nuclear energy accidents are compared to the immediate deaths from the above energy sources 25 26 267 and when the combined immediate and indirect fatalities from nuclear power and all fossil fuels are compared fatalities resulting from the mining of the necessary natural resources to power generation and to air pollution 21 with these data the use of nuclear power has been calculated to have prevented in the region of 1.8 million deaths between 1971 and 2009 by reducing the proportion of energy that would otherwise have been generated by fossil fuels and is projected to continue to do so 268 269 although according to benjamin k sovacool fission energy accidents ranked first in terms of their total economic cost accounting for 41 percent of all property damage attributed to energy accidents 270 analysis presented in the international journal human and ecological risk assessment found that coal oil liquid petroleum gas and hydroelectric accidentsprimarily due to the banqiao dam burst have resulted in greater economic impacts than nuclear power accidents 26 following the 2011 japanese fukushima nuclear disaster authorities shut down the nations 54 nuclear power plants but it has been estimated that if japan had never adopted nuclear power accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life 271 as of 2013 the fukushima site remains highly radioactive with some 160,000 evacuees still living in temporary housing and some land will be unfarmable for centuries the difficult fukushima disaster cleanup will take 40 or more years and cost tens of billions of dollars 272 273 forced evacuation from a nuclear accident may lead to social isolation anxiety depression psychosomatic medical problems reckless behavior even suicide such was the outcome of the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster in ukraine a comprehensive 2005 study concluded that the mental health impact of chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date 274 frank n von hippel a us scientist commented on the 2011 fukushima nuclear disaster saying that fear of ionizing radiation could have long-term psychological effects on a large portion of the population in the contaminated areas 275 a 2015 report in lancet explained that serious impacts of nuclear accidents were often not directly attributable to radiation exposure but rather social and psychological effects evacuation and long-term displacement of affected populations created problems for many people especially the elderly and hospital patients 276 but long-term displacement is not a unique feature to nuclear accidents with hydropower and lignite surface mining projects routinely displacing thousands during normal non-accident operations eg three gorges dam resp garzweiler surface mine attacks and sabotage terrorists could target nuclear power plants in an attempt to release radioactive contamination into the community the united states 9/11 commission has said that nuclear power plants were potential targets originally considered for the september 11 2001 attacks an attack on a reactors spent fuel pool could also be serious as these pools are less protected than the reactor core the release of radioactivity could lead to thousands of near-term deaths and greater numbers of long-term fatalities 277 if nuclear power use is to expand significantly nuclear facilities will have to be made extremely safe from attacks that could release massive quantities of radioactivity into the community new reactor designs have features of passive safety such as the flooding of the reactor core without active intervention by reactor operators but these safety measures have generally been developed and studied with respect to accidents not to the deliberate reactor attack by a terrorist group however the us nuclear regulatory commission does now also require new reactor license applications to consider security during the design stage 277 in the united states the nrc carries out force on force fof exercises at all nuclear power plant npp sites at least once every three years 277 in the us plants are surrounded by a double row of tall fences which are electronically monitored the plant grounds are patrolled by a sizeable force of armed guards 278 insider sabotage regularly occurs because insiders can observe and work around security measures successful insider crimes depended on the perpetrators observation and knowledge of security vulnerabilities 279 a fire caused 5–10 million dollars worth of damage to new yorks indian point energy center in 1971 the arsonist turned out to be a plant maintenance worker sabotage by workers has been reported at many other reactors in the united states at zion nuclear power station  1974 quad cities nuclear generating station peach bottom nuclear generating station fort st vrain generating station trojan nuclear power plant  1974 browns ferry nuclear power plant  1980 and beaver valley nuclear generating station  1981 many reactors overseas have also reported sabotage by workers 280 nuclear proliferation many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability in that they can be used to make nuclear weapons if a country chooses to do so when this happens a nuclear power program can become a route leading to a nuclear weapon or a public annex to a secret weapons program the concern over irans nuclear activities is a case in point 281 a fundamental goal for american and global security is to minimize the nuclear proliferation risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power if this development is poorly managed or efforts to contain risks are unsuccessful the nuclear future will be dangerous 281 the global nuclear energy partnership is one such international effort to create a distribution network in which developing countries in need of energy would receive nuclear fuel at a discounted rate in exchange for that nation agreeing to forgo their own indigenous develop of a uranium enrichment program the france-based eurodifeuropean gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment consortium wasis one such program that successfully implemented this concept with spain and other countries without enrichment facilities buying a share of the fuel produced at the french controlled enrichment facility but without a transfer of technology 284 iran was an early participant from 1974 and remains a shareholder of eurodif via sofidif according to benjamin k sovacool a number of high-ranking officials even within the united nations have argued that they can do little to stop states using nuclear reactors to produce nuclear weapons 285 a 2009 united nations report said that the revival of interest in nuclear power could result in the worldwide dissemination of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technologies which present obvious risks of proliferation as these technologies can produce fissile materials that are directly usable in nuclear weapons 285 on the other hand one factor influencing the support of power reactors is due to the appeal that these reactors have at reducing nuclear weapons arsenals through the megatons to megawatts program a program which eliminated 425 metric tons of highly enriched uraniumheu the equivalent of 17,000 nuclear warheads by diluting it with natural uranium making it equivalent to low enriched uraniumleu and thus suitable as nuclear fuel for commercial fission reactors this is the single most successful non-proliferation program to date 282 the megatons to megawatts program the brainchild of thomas neff of mit 286 287 was hailed as a major success by anti-nuclear weapon advocates as it has largely been the driving force behind the sharp reduction in the quantity of nuclear weapons worldwide since the cold war ended 282 however without an increase in nuclear reactors and greater demand for fissile fuel the cost of dismantling and down blending has dissuaded russia from continuing their disarmament currently according to harvard professor matthew bunn the russians are not remotely interested in extending the program beyond 2013 weve managed to set it up in a way that costs them more and profits them less than them just making new low-enriched uranium for reactors from scratch but there are other ways to set it up that would be very profitable for them and would also serve some of their strategic interests in boosting their nuclear exports 288 up to 2005 the megatons to megawatts program had processed $8 billion of heuweapons grade uranium into leureactor grade uranium with that corresponding to the elimination of 10,000 nuclear weapons 289 for approximately two decades this material generated nearly 10 percent of all the electricity consumed in the united states about half of all us nuclear electricity generated with a total of around 7 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity produced 290 enough energy to energize the entire united states electric grid for about two years 286 in total it is estimated to have cost $17 billion a bargain for us ratepayers with russia profiting $12 billion from the deal 290 much needed profit for the russian nuclear oversight industry which after the collapse of the soviet economy had difficulties paying for the maintenance and security of the russian federations highly enriched uranium and warheads 286 in april 2012 there were thirty one countries that have civil nuclear power plants 291 of which nine have nuclear weapons with the vast majority of these nuclear weapons states having first produced weapons before commercial fission electricity stations moreover the re-purposing of civilian nuclear industries for military purposes would be a breach of the non-proliferation treaty of which 190 countries adhere to environmental issues life cycle analysis lca of carbon dioxide emissions show nuclear power as comparable to renewable energy sources emissions from burning fossil fuels are many times higher 292 294 295 according to the united nations unscear regular nuclear power plant operation including the nuclear fuel cycle causes radioisotope releases into the environment amounting to 0.0002 millisieverts msv per year of public exposure as a global average 296 such is small compared to variation in natural background radiation which averages 2.4msva globally but frequently varies between 1msva and 13msva depending on a persons location as determined by unscear 296 as of a 2008 report the remaining legacy of the worst nuclear power plant accident chernobyl is 0.002msva in global average exposure a figure which was 0.04msv per person averaged over the entire populace of the northern hemisphere in the year of the accident in 1986 although far higher among the most affected local populations and recovery workers 296 climate change climate change causing weather extremes such as heat waves reduced precipitation levels and droughts can have a significant impact on all thermal power station infrastructure including large biomass-electric and fission-electric stations alike if cooling in these power stations namely in the steam condenser is provided by certain freshwater sources 297 while many thermal stations use indirect seawater cooling or cooling towers that in comparison use little to no freshwater those that were designed to heat exchange with rivers and lakes can run into economic problems this presently infrequent generic problem may become increasingly significant over time 297 this can force nuclear reactors to be shut down as happened in france during the 2003 and 2006 heat waves nuclear power supply was severely diminished by low river ﬂow rates and droughts which meant rivers had reached the maximum temperatures for cooling reactors 297 during the heat waves 17 reactors had to limit output or shut down 77 of french electricity is produced by nuclear power and in 2009 a similar situation created a 8gw shortage and forced the french government to import electricity 297 other cases have been reported from germany where extreme temperatures have reduced nuclear power production only 9 times due to high temperatures between 1979 and 2007 297 in particular the unterweser nuclear power plant reduced output by 90 between june and september 2003 297 the isar nuclear power plant cut production by 60 for 14 days due to excess river temperatures and low stream ﬂow in the river isar in 2006 297 however the more modern isar ii station did not have to cut production as unlike its sister station isar i isar ii was built with a cooling tower similar events have happened elsewhere in europe during those same hot summers 297 if global warming continues this disruption is likely to increase or alternatively station operators could instead retro-fit other means of cooling like cooling towers despite these frequently being large structures and therefore sometimes unpopular with the public comparison with renewable energy as of 2013 the world nuclear association has said there is unprecedented interest in renewable energy particularly solar and wind energy which provide electricity without giving rise to any carbon dioxide emission harnessing these for electricity depends on the cost and efficiency of the technology which is constantly improving thus reducing costs per peak kilowatt 298 renewable electricity production from sources such as wind power and solar power is frequently criticized for being intermittent or variable 299 300 like nuclear energy renewable electricity supply of primarily hydropower in the 20-50 range has already been implemented in several european systems albeit in the context of an integrated european grid system 301 in 2012 the share of electricity generated by all types of renewable sources in germany was 21.9 compared to 16.0 for nuclear power after germany shut down 7-8 of its 18 nuclear reactors in 2011 302 in the united kingdom the amount of energy produced from renewable energy is expected to exceed that from nuclear power by 2018 303 and scotland plans to obtain all electricity from renewable energy by 2020 304 the majority of installed renewable energy across the world is in the form of hydro power the ipcc has said that if governments were supportive and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed renewable energy supply could account for almost 80 of the worlds energy use within forty years 305 rajendra pachauri chairman of the ipcc said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1 of global gdp annually this approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible 305 in 2014 brookings institution published the net benefits of low and no-carbon electricity technologies which states after performing an energy and emissions cost analysis that the net benefits of new nuclear hydro and natural gas combined cycle plants far outweigh the net benefits of new wind or solar plants with the most cost effective low carbon power technology being determined to be nuclear power 306 307 308 similarly analysis in 2015 by professor and chair of environmental sustainability barry w brook and his colleagues on the topic of replacing fossil fuels entirely from the electric grid of the world has determined that at the historically modest and proven-rate at which nuclear energy was added to and replaced fossil fuels in france and sweden during each nations building programs in the 1980s within 10 years nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely allowing the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets 309 in a similar analysis brook had earlier determined that 50 of all global energy that is not solely electricity but transportation synfuels etc could be generated within approximately 30 years if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to each of these nations already proven decadal ratesin units of installed nameplate capacity gw per year per unit of global gdpgwyear 310 this is in contrast to the completely conceptual paper-studies for a 100 renewable energy world which would require an orders of magnitude more costly global investment per year which has no historical precedent having never been attempted due to its prohibitive cost 311 312 along with far greater land that would have to be devoted to the wind wave and solar projects and the inherent assumption that humanity will use less and not more energy in the future 313 314 315 as brook notes the principal limitations on nuclear fission are not technical economic or fuel-related but are instead linked to complex issues of societal acceptance fiscal and political inertia and inadequate critical evaluation of the real-world constraints facing the other low-carbon alternatives 316 while the cost of constructing established nuclear power reactor designs has followed an increasing trend due to regulations and court cases whereas the levelized cost of electricity is declining for wind power 317 in about 2011 wind power became as inexpensive as natural gascitation needed and anti-nuclear groups have suggested that in 2010 solar power became cheaper than nuclear power 318 319 data from the eia in 2011 estimated that in 2016 solar will have a levelized cost of electricity almost twice that of nuclear  21kwh for solar 11.39kwh for nuclear and wind somewhat less  9.7kwh 320 however the us eia has also cautioned that levelized costs of intermittent sources such as wind and solar are not directly comparable to costs of dispatchable sources those that can be adjusted to meet demand as intermittent sources need costly large-scale back-up power supplies for when the weather changes 321 a 2010 study by the global subsidies initiative compared global relative energy subsidies or government financial aid to different energy sources with this aid not solely funnelled into research and development but into bribing or incentivizing utilities to pursue renewable energy systems over other options results show that fossil fuels receive about 1 us cents per kwh of energy they produce nuclear energy receives 1.7 cents  kwh renewable energy excluding hydroelectricity receives 5.0 cents  kwh and biofuels receive 5.1 cents  kwh in subsidies 322 323 there is however no small volume of intensely radioactive spent fuel that needs to be stored or reprocessed with conventional renewable energy sources 324 a nuclear plant needs to be disassembled and removed much of the disassembled nuclear plant needs to be stored as low level nuclear waste for a few decades 325 however from a safety stand point nuclear power in terms of lives lost per unit of electricity delivered is comparable to and in some cases lower than many renewable energy sources 21 23 326 nuclear decommissioning the financial costs of every nuclear power plant continues for some time after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity once no longer economically viable nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities are generally decommissioned returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses such as greenfield status after a cooling-off period that may last decades reactor core materials are dismantled and cut into small pieces to be packed in containers for interim storage or transmutation experiments the consensus on how to approach the task is one that is relatively inexpensive but it has the potential to be hazardous to the natural environment as it presents opportunities for human error accidents or sabotage 327 in the usa a nuclear waste policy act and nuclear decommissioning trust fund is legally required with utilities banking 0.1 to 0.2 centskwh during operations to fund future decommissioning they must report regularly to the nrc on the status of their decommissioning funds about 70 of the total estimated cost of decommissioning all us nuclear power reactors has already been collected on the basis of the average cost of $320 million per reactor-steam turbine unit 328 329 in the us in 2011 there are 13 reactors that had permanently shut down and are in some phase of decommissioning 327 with connecticut yankee nuclear power plant and yankee rowe nuclear power station having completed the process in 2006-2007 after ceasing commercial electricity production circa 1992 the majority of the 15 years was used to allow the station to naturally cool-down on its own which makes the manual disassembly process both safer and cheaperdecommissioning at nuclear sites which have experienced a serious accident are the most expensive and time-consuming working under an insurance framework that limits or structures accident liabilities in accordance with the paris convention on nuclear third-party liability the brussels supplementary convention and the vienna convention on civil liability for nuclear damage 330 and in the us the price-anderson act it is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity but the cost is small amounting to about 0.1 of the levelized cost of electricity according to a cbo study 331 these beyond-regular-insurance costs for worst-case scenarios are not unique to nuclear power as hydroelectric power plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the banqiao dam disaster where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died or large dam failures in general as private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios major disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the state 332 debate on nuclear power the nuclear power debate concerns the controversy 12 13 64 which has surrounded the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors to generate electricity from nuclear fuel for civilian purposes the debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s when it reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies in some countries 65 333pageneeded proponents of nuclear energy contend that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions and increases energy security by decreasing dependence on imported energy sources 14 proponents claim that nuclear power produces virtually no conventional air pollution such as greenhouse gases and smog in contrast to the chief viable alternative of fossil fuel 334 nuclear power can produce base-load power unlike many renewables which are intermittent energy sources lacking large-scale and cheap ways of storing energy 335 m king hubbert saw oil as a resource that would run out and proposed nuclear energy as a replacement energy source 336 proponents claim that the risks of storing waste are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors and the operational safety record in the western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants 337 opponents believe that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment 15 16 17 these threats include the problems of processing transport and storage of radioactive nuclear waste the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorism as well as health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining 338 339 they also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong and there have been serious nuclear accidents 340 341 critics do not believe that the risks of using nuclear fission as a power source can be fully offset through the development of new technology they also argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning nuclear power is neither a low-carbon nor an economical electricity source 342 343 344 arguments of economics and safety are used by both sides of the debate use in space both fission and fusion appear promising for space propulsion applications generating higher mission velocities with less reaction mass this is due to the much higher energy density of nuclear reactions some 7 orders of magnitude  10,000,000 times more energetic than the chemical reactions which power the current generation of rockets radioactive decay has been used on a relatively small scale few kw mostly to power space missions and experiments by using radioisotope thermoelectric generators such as those developed at idaho national laboratory research advanced concepts current fission reactors in operation around the world are second or third generation systems with most of the first-generation systems having been retired some time ago research into advanced generation iv reactor types was officially started by the generation iv international forum gif based on eight technology goals including to improve nuclear safety improve proliferation resistance minimize waste improve natural resource utilization the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity and decrease the cost to build and run such plants most of these reactors differ significantly from current operating light water reactors and are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030 345 the nuclear reactors to be built at vogtle are new ap1000 third generation reactors which are said to have safety improvements over older power reactors 112 however john ma a senior structural engineer at the nrc is concerned that some parts of the ap1000 steel skin are so brittle that the impact energy from a plane strike or storm driven projectile could shatter the wall 346 edwin lyman a senior staff scientist at the union of concerned scientists is concerned about the strength of the steel containment vessel and the concrete shield building around the ap1000 346 347 the union of concerned scientists has referred to the epr nuclear reactor currently under construction in china finland and france as the only new reactor design under consideration in the united states that appears to have the potential to be significantly safer and more secure against attack than todays reactors 348 one disadvantage of any new reactor technology is that safety risks may be greater initially as reactor operators have little experience with the new design nuclear engineer david lochbaum has explained that almost all serious nuclear accidents have occurred with what was at the time the most recent technology he argues that the problem with new reactors and accidents is twofold scenarios arise that are impossible to plan for in simulations and humans make mistakes 349 as one director of a us research laboratory put it fabrication construction operation and maintenance of new reactors will face a steep learning curve advanced technologies will have a heightened risk of accidents and mistakes the technology may be proven but people are not 349 hybrid nuclear fusion-fission hybrid nuclear power is a proposed means of generating power by use of a combination of nuclear fusion and fission processes the concept dates to the 1950s and was briefly advocated by hans bethe during the 1970s but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009 due to delays in the realization of pure fusion when a sustained nuclear fusion power plant is built it has the potential to be capable of extracting all the fission energy that remains in spent fission fuel reducing the volume of nuclear waste by orders of magnitude and more importantly eliminating all actinides present in the spent fuel substances which cause security concerns 350 nuclear fusion nuclear fusion reactions have the potential to be safer and generate less radioactive waste than fission 351 352 these reactions appear potentially viable though technically quite difficult and have yet to be created on a scale that could be used in a functional power plant fusion power has been under theoretical and experimental investigation since the 1950s construction of the iter facility began in 2007 but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns the facility is now not expected to begin operations until the year 2027  11 years after initially anticipated 353 a follow on commercial nuclear fusion power station demo has been proposed 137 354 there are also suggestions for a power plant based upon a different fusion approach that of an inertial fusion power plant fusion powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable as fission-electric power had been however the extreme requirements for continuous reactions and plasma containment led to projections being extended by several decades in 2010 more than 60 years after the first attempts commercial power production was still believed to be unlikely before 2050 137 see also nuclear technology portal energy portal alsos digital library for nuclear issues
