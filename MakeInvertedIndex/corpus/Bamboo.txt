bamboo arundinarieae bambuseae olyreae olyroideae pilg  1956 parianoideae butzin  1965 the bamboos ibæmˈbuː are a subfamily bambusoideae of flowering perennial evergreen plants in the grass family poaceae giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family in bamboo the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement the dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent the absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of monocots including the palms and large bamboos to be columnar rather than tapering 3 bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants in the world 4 due to a unique rhizome-dependent system certain species of bamboo can grow 91cm  3ft within a 24-hour period at a rate of almost 4cm  1.5in an hour a growth around 1mm every 90 seconds or one inch every 40 minutes 5 bamboos are of notable economic and cultural significance in south asia southeast asia and east asia being used for building materials as a food source and as a versatile raw product bamboo has a higher specific compressive strength than wood brick or concrete and a specific tensile strength that rivals steel 6 7 the word bamboo comes from the kannada term bambu which was introduced to english through indonesian and malay 8  contents 1 systematics and taxonomy 2

8.1 bamboo noble and useful 8.2 in mythology  systematics and taxonomyedit bambuseae tropical woody bamboos olyreae herbaceous bamboos arundinarieae temperate woody bamboos pooideae oryzoideae bamboos have long been considered the most primitive grasses mostly because of the presence of bracteate indeterminate inflorescences pseudospikelets and flowers with three lodicules six stamens and three stigmata 10 following more recent molecular phylogenetic research many tribes and genera of grasses formerly included in the bambusoideae are now classified in other subfamilies eg the anomochlooideae the puelioideae and the ehrhartoideae the subfamily in its current sense belongs to the bop clade of grasses where it is sister to the pooideae bluegrasses and relatives 9 the bamboos contains three clades classified as tribes and these strongly correspond with geographic divisions representing the new world herbaceous species olyreae tropical woody bamboos bambuseae and temperate woody bamboos arundinarieae the woody bamboos do not form a monophyletic group instead the tropical woody and herbaceous bamboos are sister to the temperate woody bamboos 1 9 altogether more than 1,400 species are

yushania distributionedit most bamboo are native to warm and moist tropical and warm temperate climates however many species are found in diverse climates from hot tropical regions to cool mountainous regions and highland cloud forests in the asia-pacific region they occur across east asia from 50n latitude in sakhalin 11 south to northern australia and west to india and the himalayas china japan korea india and australia all have several endemic populations  12 they also occur in small numbers in sub-saharan africa confined to tropical areas from southern senegal in the north to southern mozambique and madagascar in the south 13 in the americas bamboo has a native range from 47 s in southern argentina and the beech forests of central chile through the south american tropical rainforests to the andes in ecuador near 14,000 feet bamboo is also native through central america and mexico northward into the southeastern united states  14 canada russia and continental europe is not known to have any native species of bamboo 15 recently some attempts have been made to grow bamboo on a commercial basis in the great lakes region of east-central africa especially in rwanda 16 in the united states several companies are growing harvesting and distributing species such as phyllostachys nigra henon and phyllostachys edulis moso 17 ecologyedit bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants on earth with reported growth rates up to 91cm  36in in 24 hours 4 however the growth rate is dependent on local soil and climatic conditions as well as species and a more typical growth rate for many commonly cultivated bamboos in temperate climates is in the range of 3–10cm  1.2–3.9in per day during the growing period primarily growing in regions of warmer climates during the late cretaceous period vast fields existed in what is now asia some of the largest timber bamboo can grow over 30m  98ft tall and be as large as 25–30cm  9.8–11.8in in diameter however the size range for mature bamboo is species-dependent with the smallest bamboos reaching only several inches high at maturity a typical height range that would cover many of the common bamboos grown in the united states is 4.6–12m  15–39ft depending on species anji county of china known as the town of bamboo provides the optimal climate and soil conditions to grow harvest and process some of the most valued bamboo poles available worldwide unlike all trees individual bamboo culms emerge from the ground at their full diameter and grow to their full height in a single growing season of three to four months during this time each new shoot grows vertically into a culm with no branching out until the majority of the mature height is reached then the branches extend from the nodes and leafing out occurs in the next year the pulpy wall of each culm slowly hardens during the third year the culm hardens further the shoot is now a fully mature culm over the next 2–5 years depending on species fungus begins to form on the outside of the culm which eventually penetrates and overcomes the culmcitation needed around 5–8 years later species- and climate-dependent the fungal growths cause the culm to collapse and decay this brief life means culms are ready for harvest and suitable for use in construction within about three to seven years individual bamboo culms do not get any taller or larger in diameter in subsequent years than they do in their first year and they do not replace any growth lost from pruning or natural breakage bamboo has a wide range of hardiness depending on species and locale small or young specimens of an individual species produce small culms initially as the clump and its rhizome system mature taller and larger culms are produced each year until the plant approaches its particular species limits of height and diameter many tropical bamboo species die at or near freezing temperatures while some of the hardier temperate bamboos can survive temperatures as low as −29c −20f some of the hardiest bamboo species can be grown inusda plant hardiness zones 5 although they typically defoliate and may even lose all above-ground growth yet the rhizomes survive and send up shoots again the next spring in milder climates such as usda zone 7 and above most bamboo remain fully leafed out and green year-round mass floweringedit most bamboo species flower infrequently in fact many only flower at intervals as long as 65 or 120 years these taxa exhibit mass flowering or gregarious flowering with all plants in a particular cohort flowering over a several-year period any plant derived through clonal propagation from this cohort will also flower regardless of whether it has been planted in a different location the longest mass flowering interval known is 130 years and it is for the species phyllostachys bambusoides sieb  zucc in this species all plants of the same stock flower at the same time regardless of differences in geographic locations or climatic conditions and then the bamboo dies the lack of environmental impact on the time of flowering indicates the presence of some sort of alarm clock in each cell of the plant which signals the diversion of all energy to flower production and the cessation of vegetative growth 18 this mechanism as well as the evolutionary cause behind it is still largely a mystery one hypothesis to explain the evolution of this semelparous mass flowering is the predator satiation hypothesis which argues that by fruiting at the same time a population increases the survival rate of its seeds by flooding the area with fruit so even if predators eat their fill seeds will still be left over by having a flowering cycle longer than the lifespan of the rodent predators bamboos can regulate animal populations by causing starvation during the period between flowering events thus the death of the adult clone is due to resource exhaustion as it would be more effective for parent plants to devote all resources to creating a large seed crop than to hold back energy for their own regeneration 19 another the fire cycle hypothesis states that periodic flowering followed by death of the adult plants has evolved as a mechanism to create disturbance in the habitat thus providing the seedlings with a gap in which to grow this argues that the dead culms create a large fuel load and also a large target for lightning strikes increasing the likelihood of wildfire 20 because bamboos can be aggressive as early successional plants the seedlings would be able to outstrip other plants and take over the space left by their parents however both have been disputed for different reasons the predator satiation hypothesis does not explain why the flowering cycle is 10 times longer than the lifespan of the local rodents something not predicted the bamboo fire cycle hypothesis is considered by a few scientists to be unreasonable they argue 21 that fires only result from humans and there is no natural fire in india this notion is considered wrong based on distribution of lightning strike data during the dry season throughout india however another argument against this is the lack of precedent for any living organism to harness something as unpredictable as lightning strikes to increase its chance of survival as part of natural evolutionary progress 22 more recently a mathematical explanation for the extreme length of the flowering cycles has been offered involving both the stabilizing selection implied by the predator satiation hypothesis and others and the fact that plants that flower at longer intervals tend to release more seeds 23 24 the hypothesis claims that bamboo flowering intervals grew by integer multiplication a mutant bamboo plant flowering at a noninteger multiple of its populations flowering interval would release its seeds alone and would not enjoy the benefits of collective flowering such as protection from predators however a mutant bamboo plant flowering at an integer multiple of its populations flowering interval would release its seeds only during collective flowering events and would release more seeds than the average plant in the population it could therefore take over the population establishing a flowering interval that is an integer multiple of the previous flowering interval the hypothesis predicts that observed bamboo flowering intervals should factorize into small prime numbers the mass fruiting also has direct economic and ecological consequences however the huge increase in available fruit in the forests often causes a boom in rodent populations leading to increases in disease and famine in nearby human populations for example devastating consequences occur when the melocanna bambusoides population flowers and fruits once every 30–35 years 25 around the bay of bengal the death of the bamboo plants following their fruiting means the local people lose their building material and the large increase in bamboo fruit leads to a rapid increase in rodent populations as the number of rodents increases they consume all available food including grain fields and stored food sometimes leading to famine these rats can also carry dangerous diseases such as typhus typhoid and bubonic plague which can reach epidemic proportions as the rodents increase in number 18 19 the relationship between rat populations and bamboo flowering was examined in a 2009 nova documentary rat attack in any case flowering produces masses of seeds typically suspended from the ends of the branches these seeds give rise to a new generation of plants that may be identical in appearance to those that preceded the flowering or they may produce new cultivars with different characteristics such as the presence or absence of striping or other changes in coloration of the culms several bamboo species are never known to set seed even when sporadically flowering has been reported bambusa vulgaris bambusa balcooa and dendrocalamus stocksii are common examples of such bamboo 26 animal dietedit soft bamboo shoots stems and leaves are the major food source of the giant panda of china the red panda of nepal and the bamboo lemurs of madagascar rats eat the fruits as described above mountain gorillas of africa also feed on bamboo and have been documented consuming bamboo sap which was fermented and alcoholic 13 chimpanzees and elephants of the region also eat the stalks the larvae of the bamboo borer the moth omphisa fuscidentalis of laos myanmar thailand and yunnan province china feeds off the pulp of live bamboo in turn these caterpillars are considered a local delicacy cultivationedit commercial timberedit timber is harvested from both cultivated and wild stands and some of the larger bamboos particularly species in the genus phyllostachys are known as timber bamboos harvestingedit bamboo used for construction purposes must be harvested when the culms reach their greatest strength and when sugar levels in the sap are at their lowest as high sugar content increases the ease and rate of pest infestation harvesting of bamboo is typically undertaken according to these cycles 1 lifecycle of the culm as each individual culm goes through a 5 to 7-year lifecycle culms are ideally allowed to reach this level of maturity prior to full capacity harvesting the clearing out or thinning of culms particularly older decaying culms helps to ensure adequate light and resources for new growth well-maintained clumps may have a productivity three to four times that of an unharvested wild clump consistent with the lifecycle described above bamboo is harvested from two to three years through to five to seven years depending on the species 2 annual cycle as all growth of new bamboo occurs during the wet season disturbing the clump during this phase will potentially damage the upcoming crop also during this high-rainfall period sap levels are at their highest and then diminish towards the dry season picking immediately prior to the wetgrowth season may also damage new shoots hence harvesting is best a few months prior to the start of the wet season 3 daily cycle during the height of the day photosynthesis is at its peak producing the highest levels of sugar in sap making this the least ideal time of day to harvest many traditional practitioners believe the best time to harvest is at dawn or dusk on a waning moon leachingedit leaching is the removal of sap after harvest in many areas of the world the sap levels in harvested bamboo are reduced either through leaching or postharvest photosynthesis examples of this practice include in the process of water leaching the bamboo is dried slowly and evenly in the shade to avoid cracking in the outer skin of the bamboo thereby reducing opportunities for pest infestation durability of bamboo in construction is directly related to how well it is handled from the moment of planting through harvesting transportation storage design construction and maintenance bamboo harvested at the correct time of year and then exposed to ground contact or rain will break down just as quickly as incorrectly harvested material 27 ornamental bamboosedit the two general patterns for the growth of bamboo are clumping sympodial and running monopodial clumping bamboo species tend to spread slowly as the growth pattern of the rhizomes is to simply expand the root mass gradually similar to ornamental grasses running bamboos though need to be controlled during cultivation because of their potential for aggressive behavior they spread mainly through their roots andor rhizomes which can spread widely underground and send up new culms to break through the surface running bamboo species are highly variable in their tendency to spread this is related to both the species and the soil and climate conditions some can send out runners of several metres a year while others can stay in the same general area for long periods if neglected over time they can cause problems by moving into adjacent areas bamboos seldom and unpredictably flower and the frequency of flowering varies greatly from species to species once flowering takes place a plant declines and often dies entirely although a few species of bamboo are always in flower at any given time collectors desiring to grow specific bamboo typically obtain their plants as divisions of already-growing plants rather than waiting for seeds to be produced regular observations indicate major growth directions and locations once the rhizomes are cut they are typically removed however rhizomes take a number of months to mature and an immature severed rhizome usually ceases growing if left in-ground if any bamboo shoots come up outside of the bamboo area afterwards their presence indicates the precise location of the removed rhizome the fibrous roots that radiate from the rhizomes do not produce more bamboo bamboo growth is also controlled by surrounding the plant or grove with a physical barrier typically concrete and specially rolled hdpe plastic are the materials used to create the barrier which is placed in a 60 to 90-cm-deep ditch around the planting and angled out at the top to direct the rhizomes to the surface this is only possible if the barrier is installed in a straight line if the containment area is small this method can be detrimental to ornamental bamboo as the bamboo within can become rootbound and start to display the signs of any unhealthy containerized plant in addition rhizomes can escape over the top or beneath the barrier if it is not deep enough strong rhizomes and tools can penetrate plastic barriers so care must be taken in small areas regular maintenance may be the best method for controlling the running bamboos barriers and edging are unnecessary for clump-forming bamboos although these may eventually need to have portions removed if they become too large the ornamental plant sold in containers and marketed as lucky bamboo is actually an entirely unrelated plant dracaena sanderiana it is a resilient member of the lily family that grows in the dark tropical rainforests of southeast asia and africa lucky bamboo has long been associated with the eastern practice of feng shui and images of the plant widely available on the web are often used to depict bamboo on a similar note japanese knotweed is also sometimes mistaken for a bamboo but it grows wild and is considered an invasive species phyllostachys species of bamboo are also considered invasive and illegal to sell or propagate in some areas of the us 28 usesedit culinaryedit although the shoots new culms that come out of the ground of bamboo contain a toxin taxiphyllin a cyanogenic glycoside that produces cyanide in the gut proper processing renders them edible they are used in numerous asian dishes and broths and are available in supermarkets in various sliced forms in both fresh and canned versions the golden bamboo lemur ingests many times the quantity of the taxiphyllin-containing bamboo that would kill a human the bamboo shoot in its fermented state forms an important ingredient in cuisines across the himalayas in assam india for example it is called khorisa in nepal a delicacy popular across ethnic boundaries consists of bamboo shoots fermented with turmeric and oil and cooked with potatoes into a dish that usually accompanies rice alu tama आल तम in nepali in indonesia they are sliced thin and then boiled with santan thick coconut milk and spices to make a dish called gulai rebung other recipes using bamboo shoots are sayur lodeh mixed vegetables in coconut milk and lun pia sometimes written lumpia fried wrapped bamboo shoots with vegetables the shoots of some species contain toxins that need to be leached or boiled out before they can be eaten safely pickled bamboo used as a condiment may also be made from the pith of the young shoots the sap of young stalks tapped during the rainy season may be fermented to make ulanzi a sweet wine or simply made into a soft drink bamboo leaves are also used as wrappers for steamed dumplings which usually contains glutinous rice and other ingredients pickled bamboo shoots nepali तम tama are cooked with black-eyed beans as a delicacy food in nepal many nepalese restaurant around the world serve this dish as aloo bodi tama fresh bamboo shoots are sliced and pickled with mustard seeds and turmeric and kept in glass jar in direct sunlight for the best taste it is used alongside many dried beans in cooking during winters baby shoots nepali tusa of a very different variety of bamboo nepali नगल nigalo native to nepal is cooked as a curry in hilly regions in sambalpur india the tender shoots are grated into juliennes and fermented to prepare kardi the name is derived from the sanskrit word for bamboo shoot karira this fermented bamboo shoot is used in various culinary preparations notably amil a sour vegetable soup it is also made into pancakes using rice flour as a binding agent the shoots that have turned a little fibrous are fermented dried and ground to sand-sized particles to prepare a garnish known as hendua it is also cooked with tender pumpkin leaves to make sag green leaves in konkani cuisine the tender shoots kirlu are grated and cooked with crushed jackfruit seeds to prepare kirla sukke the empty hollow in the stalks of larger bamboo is often used to cook food in many asian cultures soups are boiled and rice is cooked in the hollows of fresh stalks of bamboo directly over a flame similarly steamed tea is sometimes rammed into bamboo hollows to produce compressed forms of pu-erh tea cooking food in bamboo is said to give the food a subtle but distinctive taste in addition bamboo is frequently used for cooking utensils within many cultures and is used in the manufacture of chopsticks in modern times some see bamboo tools as an ecofriendly alternative to other manufactured utensils medicineedit bamboo is used in traditional chinese medicine for treating infections and healing 29 in northern indian state of assam the fermented bamboo paste known as khorisa is known locally as a folk remedy for the treatment of impotence infertility and menstrual pains constructionedit bamboo like true wood is a natural composite material with a high strength-to-weight ratio useful for structures 30 in its natural form bamboo as a construction material is traditionally associated with the cultures of south asia east asia and the south pacific to some extent in central and south america and by extension in the aesthetic of tiki culture in china and india bamboo was used to hold up simple suspension bridges either by making cables of split bamboo or twisting whole culms of sufficiently pliable bamboo together one such bridge in the area of qian-xian is referenced in writings dating back to 960 ad and may have stood since as far back as the third century bc due largely to continuous maintenance bamboo has also long been used as scaffolding the practice has been banned in china for buildings over six stories but is still in continuous use for skyscrapers in hong kong 31 in the philippines the nipa hut is a fairly typical example of the most basic sort of housing where bamboo is used the walls are split and woven bamboo and bamboo slats and poles may be used as its support in japanese architecture bamboo is used primarily as a supplemental andor decorative element in buildings such as fencing fountains grates and gutters largely due to the ready abundance of quality timber 32 various structural shapes may be made by training the bamboo to assume them as it grows squared sections of bamboo are created by compressing the growing stalk within a square form arches may similarly be created by forcing the bamboos growth into the desired form costing much less than it would to obtain the same shape with regular wood timber more traditional forming methods such as the application of heat and pressure may also be used to curve or flatten the cut stalks 33 bamboo can be cut and laminated into sheets and planks this process involves cutting stalks into thin strips planing them flat and boiling and drying the strips they are then glued pressed and finished 34 long used in china and japan entrepreneurs started developing and selling laminated bamboo flooring in the west during the mid-1990s 34 products made from bamboo laminate including flooring cabinetry furniture and even decorations are currently surging in popularity transitioning from the boutique market to mainstream providers such as home depot the bamboo goods industry which also includes small goods fabric etc is expected to be worth $25 billion by 2012 35 the quality of bamboo laminate varies among manufacturers and varies according to the maturity of the plant from which it was harvested six years being considered the optimum the sturdiest products fulfill their claims of being up to three times harder than oak hardwood while others may be softer than standard hardwood 34 bamboo intended for use in construction should be treated to resist insects and rot the most common solution for this purpose is a mixture of borax and boric acid another process involves boiling cut bamboo to remove the starches that attract insects 34 bamboo has been used as reinforcement for concrete in those areas where it is plentiful though dispute exists over its effectiveness in the various studies done on the subject bamboo does have the necessary strength to fulfil this function but untreated bamboo will swell with water absorbed from the concrete causing it to crack several procedures must be followed to overcome this shortcoming 36 several institutes businesses and universities are researching the use of bamboo as an ecological construction material in the united states and france it is possible to get houses made entirely of bamboocitation needed which are earthquake- and cyclone-resistant and internationally certified three iso standards are given for bamboo as a construction material in parts of india bamboo is used for drying clothes indoors both as a rod high up near the ceiling to hang clothes on and as a stick wielded with acquired expert skill to hoist spread and to take down the clothes when dry it is also commonly used to make ladders which apart from their normal function are also used for carrying bodies in funerals in maharashtra the bamboo groves and forests are called veluvana the name velu for bamboo is most likely from sanskrit while vana means forest furthermore bamboo is also used to create flagpoles for saffron-coloured hindu religious flags which can be seen fluttering across india especially in bihar and uttar pradesh as well as in guyana and suriname in south america bamboo was used for the structural members of the india pavilion at expo 2010 in shanghai the pavilion is the worlds largest bamboo dome about 34m  112ft in diameter with bamboo beamsmembers overlaid with a ferro-concrete slab waterproofing copper plate solar pv panels a small windmill and live plants a total of 30km  19mi of bamboo was used the dome is supported on 18-m-long steel piles and a series of steel ring beams the bamboo was treated with borax and boric acid as a fire retardant and insecticide and bent in the required shape the bamboo sections were joined with reinforcement bars and concrete mortar to achieve the necessary lengths 37 textilesedit since the fibers of bamboo are very short less than 3mm  0.12in they are not usually transformed into yarn by a natural process the usual process by which textiles labeled as being made of bamboo are produced uses only rayon made from the fibers with heavy employment of chemicals to accomplish this the fibers are broken down with chemicals and extruded through mechanical spinnerets the chemicals include lye carbon disulfide and strong acids 34 retailers have sold both end products as bamboo fabric to cash in on bamboos current ecofriendly cachet however the canadian competition bureau 38 and the us federal trade commission 39 as of mid-2009 are cracking down on the practice of labeling bamboo rayon as natural bamboo fabric under the guidelines of both agencies these products must be labeled as rayon with the optional qualifier from bamboo 39 as a writing surfaceedit bamboo was in widespread use in early china as a medium for written documents the earliest surviving examples of such documents written in ink on string-bound bundles of bamboo strips or slips date from the fifth century bc during the warring states period however references in earlier texts surviving on other media make it clear that some precursor of these warring states period bamboo slips was in use as early as the late shang period from about 1250 bc bamboo or wooden strips were the standard writing material during the han dynasty and excavated examples have been found in abundance 40 subsequently paper began to displace bamboo and wooden strips from mainstream uses and by the fourth century ad bamboo slips had been largely abandoned as a medium for writing in china several paper industries are surviving on bamboo forests ballarpur chandrapur maharstra paper mills use bamboo for paper production bamboo fiber has been used to make paper in china since early times a high-quality handmade paper is still produced in small quantities coarse bamboo paper is still used to make spirit money in many chinese communities 41 bamboo pulps are mainly produced in china myanmar thailand and india and are used in printing and writing papers 42 the most common bamboo species used for paper are dendrocalamus asper and bambusa blumeana it is also possible to make dissolving pulp from bamboo the average fiber length is similar to hardwoods but the properties of bamboo pulp are closer to softwood pulps due to it having a very broad fiber length distribution 42 with the help of molecular tools it is now possible to distinguish the superior fiber-yielding speciesvarieties even at juvenile stages of their growth which can help in unadulterated merchandise production 43 weaponsedit bamboo has often been used to construct weapons and is still incorporated in several asian martial arts a bamboo staff sometimes with one end sharpened is used in the tamil martial art of silambam a word derived from a term meaning hill bamboo staves used in the indian martial art of gatka are commonly made from bamboo a material favoured for its light weight a bamboo sword called a shinai is used in the japanese martial art of kendo bamboo is used for crafting the bows called yumi and arrows used in the japanese martial art kyudo bamboo is sometimes used to craft the limbs of the longbow and recurve bow used in traditional archery and to make superior weapons for bowhunting and target archery the first gunpowder-based weapons such as the fire lance were made of bamboo bamboo was apparently used in east and south asia as a means of torture musical instrumentsedit other usesedit bamboo has traditionally been used to make a wide range of everyday utensils particularly in japan 44 where archaeological excavations have uncovered bamboo baskets dating to the late jomon period  2000–1000 bc 45 bamboo has a long history of use in asian furniture chinese bamboo furniture is a distinct style based on a millennia-long tradition several manufacturers offer bamboo bicycles surfboards snowboards and skateboards 46 47 due to its flexibility bamboo is also used to make fishing rods the split cane rod is especially prized for fly fishing bamboo has been traditionally used in malaysia as a firecracker called a meriam buluh or bamboo cannon four-foot-long sections of bamboo are cut and a mixture of water and calcium carbide are introduced the resulting acetylene gas is ignited with a stick producing a loud bang bamboo can be used in water desalination a bamboo filter is used to remove the salt from seawaterdubious  discuss 48 food is cooked in east timor in bamboo in fire this is called tukir many minority groups in remote areas that have water access in asia use bamboo that is 3–5 years old to make rafts they use 8 to 12 poles 6–7 m  20 to 24ft long laid together side by side to a width of about 1m  3.3ft once the poles are lined up together they cut a hole crosswise through the poles at each end and use a small bamboo pole pushed through that hole like a screw to hold all the long bamboo poles together floating houses use whole bamboo stalks tied together in a big bunch to support the house floating in the water bamboo is also used to make eating utensils such as chopsticks trays and tea scoops the song dynasty  960–1279 ad chinese scientist and polymath shen kuo  1031–1095 used the evidence of underground petrified bamboo found in the dry northern climate of yanan shanbei region shaanxi province to support his geological theory of gradual climate change 49 50 symbolism and cultureedit bamboos long life makes it a chinese symbol of uprightness while in india it is a symbol of friendship the rarity of its blossoming has led to the flowers being regarded as a sign of impending famine this may be due to rats feeding upon the profusion of flowers then multiplying and destroying a large part of the local food supply the most recent flowering began in may 2006 see mautam bamboo is said to bloom in this manner only about every 50 years see 28–60 year examples in fao gregarious species table in chinese culture the bamboo plum blossom orchid and chrysanthemum often known as méi lán zhú jú 梅兰竹菊 are collectively referred to as the four gentlemen these four plants also represent the four seasons and in confucian ideology four aspects of the junzi prince or noble one the pine sōng 松 the bamboo zhú 竹 and the plum blossom méi 梅 are also admired for their perseverance under harsh conditions and are together known as the three friends of winter 岁寒三友 suìhán sānyǒu in chinese culture the three friends of winter is traditionally used as a system of ranking in japan for example in sushi sets or accommodations at a traditional ryokan pine matsu 松 is of the first rank bamboo take 竹 is of second rank and plum ume 梅 is of the third the bozo ethnic group of west africa take their name from the bambara phrase bo-so which means bamboo house bamboo is also the national plant of st lucia bamboo noble and usefuledit bamboo one of the four gentlemen bamboo orchid plum blossom and chrysanthemum plays such an important role in traditional chinese culture that it is even regarded as a behavior model of the gentleman as bamboo has features such as uprightness tenacity and hollow heart people endow bamboo with integrity elegance and plainness though it is not physically strong countless poems praising bamboo written by ancient chinese poets are actually metaphorically about people who exhibited these characteristics according to laws an ancient poet bai juyi  772–846 thought that to be a gentleman a man does not need to be physically strong but he must be mentally strong upright and perseverant just as a bamboo is hollow-hearted he should open his heart to accept anything of benefit and never have arrogance or prejudice bamboo is not only a symbol of a gentleman but also plays an important role in buddhism which was introduced into china in the first century as canons of buddhism forbids cruelty to animals flesh and egg were not allowed in the diet the tender bamboo shoot sǔn筍 in chinese thus became a nutritious alternative preparation methods developed over thousands of years have come to be incorporated into asian cuisines especially for monks a buddhist monk zan ning wrote a manual of the bamboo shoot called sǔn pǔ筍譜 offering descriptions and recipes for many kinds of bamboo shoots 51 bamboo shoot has always been a traditional dish on the chinese dinner table especially in southern china in ancient times those who could afford a big house with a yard would plant bamboo in their garden in japan a bamboo forest sometimes surrounds a shinto shrine as
