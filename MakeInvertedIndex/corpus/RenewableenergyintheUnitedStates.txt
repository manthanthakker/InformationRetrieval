resources rationale for renewablesedit renewable energy technologies encompass a broad diverse array of technologies including solar photovoltaics solar thermal power plants and heatingcooling systems wind farms hydroelectricity geothermal power plants and ocean power systems and the use of biomass the report outlook on renewable energy in america explains that america needs renewable energy for many reasons america needs energy that is secure reliable improves public health protects the environment addresses climate change creates jobs and provides technological leadership america needs renewable energy if renewable energy is to be developed to its full potential america will need coordinated sustained federal and state policies that expand renewable energy markets promote and deploy new technology and provide appropriate opportunities to encourage renewable energy use in all critical energy market sectors wholesale and distributed electricity generation thermal energy applications and transportation 17 another benefit of some renewable energy technologies like wind and solar photovoltaics pv is that they require little or no water to generate electricity whereas thermoelectric fossil fuel based power plants require vast amounts of water for operation in 2009 president barack obama in the inaugural address called for the expanded use of renewable energy to meet the twin challenges of energy security and climate change those were the first references ever to the nations energy use to renewable resources and to climate change in an inauguration speech of a us president president obama looked to the near future saying that as a nation the united states will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories 18 the presidents new energy for america plan calls for a federal investment of $150 billion over the next decade to catalyze private efforts to build a clean energy future specifically the plan calls for renewable energy to supply 10 of the nations electricity by 2012 rising to 25 by 2025 18 in his joint address to congress in 2009 obama stated that we know the country that harnesses the power of clean renewable energy will lead the 21st centurythanks to our recovery plan we will double this nations supply of renewable energy in the next three years it is time for america to lead again 15 according to clean edge theres little doubt that the future of energy will be cleaner the transition from carbon-intensive energy sources like wood coal and oil to natural gas and renewables is well underway for much of the developed world and for developing nations the future looks increasingly like it will be built off of a mix of energy efficiency renewables the electrification of transport and lower carbon fuels like natural gas 19 a 2010 survey conducted by applied materials shows that two-thirds of americans believe solar technology should play a greater role in meeting the countrys energy needs in addition three-quarters of americans feel that increasing renewable energy and decreasing us dependence on foreign oil are the countrys top energy priorities according to the survey "67 percent of americans would be willing to pay more for their monthly utility bill if their utility company increased its use of renewable energy 20 in a 2010 chicago council on global affairs public opinion survey an overwhelming 91 percent believed investing in renewable energy is important for the united states to remain economically competitive with other countries with 62 percent considering this very important the same poll found strong support for tax incentives to encourage development of renewable energy sources specifically as a way to reduce foreign energy imports eight in ten  80 percent favored tax incentives 47 percent strongly and only 17 percent were opposed 21 as of 2011 new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain new epa initiatives targeting air toxics coal ash and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies the use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages events at the fukushima nuclear plant have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term further cost estimates for next generation nuclear units continue to climb and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees 22 current trendsedit renewable energy in the united states accounted for 13.44 percent of the domestically produced electricity in 2015 23 california is a leading state and around 29 percent of californias electricity comes from rps eligible renewable sources including hydropower 24 the united states has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world which have the potential to meet a rising and significant share of the nations energy demand a quarter of the us land area has winds strong enough to generate electricity at the same price as natural gas and coal 25 many of the new technologies that harness renewables  including wind solar geothermal and biofuels  are or soon will be economically competitive with the fossil fuels that meet 85 percent of us energy needs dynamic growth rates are driving down costs and spurring rapid advances in technologies 25 energy technologies also receive government subsidies in 2013 federal government energy-specific subsidies and supports for renewables fossil fuels and nuclear were $15.043 billion $3.431 billion and $1.66 billion respectively the subsidies and supports specific to electricity production amount to $11.678 billion $1.591 billion and $1.66 billion respectively 26 all but a few us states now have incentives in place to promote renewable energy while more than a dozen have enacted new renewable energy laws in recent years 25 renewable energy suffered a political setback in the united states in september 2011 with the bankruptcy of solyndra a company that had received a $535 million federal loan guarantee 27 28 the united states used about 4,000 billion kwhyear of electricity in 2012 and about 98 quadrillion btuyear  30,000 billion kwh efficiency improvements are expected to reduce usage to 15,000 billion kwh by 2050 the united states has the potential of installing 11 million mw of onshore wind power and 4 million mw of offshore wind power capable of generating over 47,000 billion kwh the us has the potential of installing 10 to 20 million mw of concentrated solar power in the southwest capable of generating over 10,000 billion kwh 30not in citation given will result in a total of 627.7 giga kilowatt hours g kwh of renewable electric energy in 2019 this would be up 89.4 g kwh +16.7 from 2014 hydroelectricityedit hydroelectric power is currently the largest producer of renewable power in the us it produced around 6.14 of the nations total electricity in 2015 which was 45.71 of the total renewable power in the us 34 the united states is the fourth largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world after china canada and brazil the grand coulee dam is the 5th largest hydroelectric power station in the world and another six us hydro plants are among the 50 largest in the world the amount of hydroelectric power generated is strongly affected by changes in precipitation and surface runoff hydroelectric plants exist in at least 34 us states hydroelectricity projects such as hoover dam grand coulee dam and the tennessee valley authority have become iconic large construction projects the contribution over the last eleven years of hydroelectric power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the hydroelectric power generation for 2015 this shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to resource availability and needs wind poweredit us wind power installed capacity now exceeds 72 gw 32 this capacity is exceeded only by china the 1,320mw alta wind energy center is the largest wind farm in the world shepherds flat wind farm in oregon is the second largest wind farm in the world completed in 2012 with the nameplate capacity of 845 mw 40 the us wind industry generates tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity 41 wind projects boost local tax bases and revitalize the economy of rural communities by providing a steady income stream to farmers with wind turbines on their land 39 ge energy is the largest domestic wind turbine manufacturer 39 in 2013 wind power received $5.936 billion in federal funding which is 37 of all federal funding for electrity generation 26 in 2012 there were 8,900 mw under construction in nearly 100 projects 42 the united states has the potential of installing 10 million mw of onshore wind power and 4 million mw of offshore wind 43 the us department of energys report 20 wind energy by 2030 envisioned that wind power could supply 20 of all us electricity which included a contribution of 4 from offshore wind power 41 additional transmission lines will need to be added to bring power from windy states to the rest of the country 44 in august 2011 a coalition of 24 governors asked the obama administration to provide a more favorable business climate for the development of wind power 45 these are the largest wind farms in the united states as of 2016 the contribution over the last eleven years of wind electric power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the wind electric power generation for 2015 this shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to wind availability solar poweredit solar power will be discussed in three distinct varieties  electric energy is generated by two different methods -thermal and photovoltaic application is either utility scale for electric grid power generation or much smaller distributed systems which may or may not be integrated into the electric grid utility grade systems have well documented generation but distributed systems contributions to user electric power needs are not measured or controlled therefore quantitative evaluation of distributive solar to the overall us electric power environment has been lacking recently the energy information administration 56 57 has begun estimating that contribution in 2015 utility scale solar 59 contributed 26.47 g kwh billion kwh to the grid with 23.233 g kwh from photovoltaics and 3.24 g kwh from thermal systems in 2014 and 2015 eia estimated that distributed solar 60 generated 9.536 g kwh and 12.141 g kwh respectively solar thermal power utility scaleedit prior to 2012 in six southwestern states arizona california colorado nevada new mexico and utah the us bureau of land management owned nearly 98 million acres an area larger than the state of montana that was open to proposals for solar power installations to streamline consideration of applications the blm produced a programmatic environmental impact statement peis by the subsequent record of decision in october 2012 the blm withdrew 78 percent of its land from possible solar development leaving 19 million acres still open to applications for solar installations an area nearly as large as south carolina of the area left open to solar proposals the blm has identified 285 thousand acres in 17 highly favorable areas it calls solar energy zones 64 65 66 67 solar energy generating systemsedit solar energy generating systems segs is the name given to nine solar power plants in the mojave desert segs i-vii are located at kramer junction and segs viii and ix are at harper lake and barstow respectively the segs power plants were commissioned between 1984 and 1991 11 the installation uses parabolic trough solar thermal technology along with natural gas to generate electricity the facility has a total of 400,000 mirrors and covers 1,000 acres  4km the plants have a total generating capacity of 354 mw 11 nevada solar oneedit nevada solar one generates 64mw of power and in boulder city nevada and was built by the us department of energy doe national renewable energy laboratory nrel and solargenix energy nevada solar one started producing electricity in june 2007 nevada solar one uses parabolic troughs as thermal solar concentrators heating tubes of liquid which act as solar receivers these solar receivers are specially coated tubes made of glass and steel about 19,300 of these 4 metre long tubes are used in the newly built power plant nevada solar one also uses a technology that collects extra heat by putting it into phase-changing molten salts this energy can then be drawn on at night 68 solar thermal power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in prosperous areas with significant cooling demands such as the south-western united states using thermal energy storage systems solar thermal operating periods can even be extended to meet base-load needs 69 ivanpah solar power facilityedit the ivanpah solar power facility is a 392 megawatt mw solar power facility which is located in south-eastern california 70 the facility formally opened on february 13 2014 71 othersedit the solana generating station is a 280 mw solar power plant which is near gila bend arizona about 70 miles  110km southwest of phoenix the 250mw mojave solar project is located near barstow california the crescent dunes solar energy project is a 110megawatt mw solar thermal power project near tonopah about 190 miles  310km northwest of las vegas 72 land use issuesedit a 2013 study by the us national renewable energy laboratory concluded that utility-scale solar power plants directly disturb an average of 2.7 to 2.9 acres per gigawatt-houryear and use from 3.5 to 3.8 acres per gw-hryear for the entire sites according to a 2009 study this intensity of land use is less than that of the average us power plant using surface-mined coal 73 some of the land in the eastern portion of the mojave desert is to be preserved but the solar industry is more interested in areas of the western desert where the sun burns hotter and there is easier access to transmission lines 74 generationedit the contribution to the us electric grid over the last eleven years of solar thermal electric power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the solar thermal power generation for 2014 and 2015 this shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to sunlight availability before 2008 most solar-generated electric energy was from thermal systems by 2011 photovoltaics had overtaken thermal solar photovoltaic power utility scaleedit at the end of 2014 the us had 18.3 gigawatts gw of installed photovoltaic capacity with an additional 1.7 gw of concentrated solar power 76 the us pioneered solar farms and many key developments in photovoltaics came out of us research the us has some of the largest solar farms in the world solar star is a 579 megawatt mwac farm near rosamond california completed in june 2015 it uses 1.7 million solar panels spread over 13 square kilometers  3,200 acres 77 78 79 the desert sunlight solar farm is a 550 mw solar power plant in riverside county california that uses thin-film solar photovoltaic modules made by first solar 12 the topaz solar farm is a 550 mw photovoltaic power plant in san luis obispo county california 13 the blythe solar power project is a 485 mw photovoltaic station planned for riverside county california many schools and businesses have building-integrated photovoltaic solar panels on their roof most of these are grid connected and use net metering laws to allow use of electricity in the evening that was generated during the daytime new jersey leads the nation with the least restrictive net metering law while california leads in total number of homes which have solar panels installed many were installed because of the million solar roof initiative 80 california decided that it is not moving forward fast enough on photovoltaic generation and in 2008 enacted a feed-in tariff washington state has a feed-in tariff of 15 kwh which increases to 54 kwh if components are manufactured in the state 81 by 2015 california hawaii arizona and some other states were lowering payments to distributed solar owners and instituting new fees for grid usage tesla and a handful of other companies were promoting household grid-tied batteries while some electric companies were investing in utility-scale grid energy storage including very large batteries the contribution to the us electric grid over the last ten years of solar photovoltaic electric power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the photovoltaic power generation for 2014 and 2015 this shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to sunlight availability before 2008 most solar-generated electric energy was from thermal systems by 2011 photovoltaics had overtaken thermal estimated distributed solar capacityedit beginning with the 2014 data year energy information administration will estimate distributed solar photovoltaic generation and distributed solar photovoltaic capacity 82 these non-utility scale estimates project that in 2014 the usa generated 83 a further 9.536 gwh and in 2015 an additional 12.141 gwh of solar electricity from such distributed pv systems state information follows geothermal poweredit the usa is the world leader in online capacity and the generation of electricity from geothermal energy 86 according to 2014 state energy data geothermal energy provided approximately 16 billion kilowatt hours kwh of electricity—0.31 of the electricity consumed in the us as of may 2007 geothermal electric power was generated in five us states alaska california hawaii nevada and utah according to the geothermal energy associations recent report there were 75 new geothermal power projects underway in 12 states as of may 2007  this is an increase of 14 projects in an additional three states compared to a survey completed in november 2006 86 the most significant catalyst behind new industry activity is the energy policy act of 2005 this act made new geothermal plants eligible for the full federal production tax credit previously available only to wind power projects it also authorized and directed increased funding for research by the department of energy and gave the bureau of land management new legal guidance and secure funding to address its backlog of geothermal leases and permits 86 installed geothermal capacity in megawatts mw by state as of february 2013 87 the contribution over the last eleven years of geothermal power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the geothermal power generation for 2014 solar water heatingedit the us department of energy stated in 2006 that more than 1.5 million homes and businesses were currently using solar water heating in the united states representing a capacity of over 1,000 megawatts mw of thermal energy generation it predicted that another 400 mw was likely to be installed over the next 3–5 years assuming that 40 percent of existing homes in the united states have adequate access to sunlight 29 million solar water heaters could be installed 88 solar water heaters can operate in any climate performance varies depending on how much solar energy is available at the site as well as how cold the water coming into the system is the colder the water the more efficiently the system operates 88 solar water heaters reduce the need for conventional water heating by about two-thirds and pay for their installation within 4 to 8 years with electricity or natural gas savings compared to those with electric water heaters florida homeowners with solar water heaters save 50 to 85 percent on their water heating bills according to the florida solar energy center 88 biomassedit in 2015 biomass generated 64.19 million megawatt-hours 1.57 of total us generated electricity it was the largest source of total renewable energy in the us and the third-largest renewable source of electrical power in the us after hydropower and wind 89 biomass is biological material derived from living or recently living organisms such as plants and trees and utilizes wastes or plant matter specifically grown to generate electricity or produce heat the main advantage of using grown fuels as opposed to fossil fuels such as coal natural gas and oil is that while they are growing they absorb the near-equivalent in carbon dioxide an important greenhouse gas to that which is later released in their burning although there is some debate over the net carbon neutrality and near term affects of using the biomass for energy a key difference is the relatively short carbon recycle period of grown biomass several years or decades as opposed to the millions of years it took to turn carbon into fossil fuels with proper conservation and growing techniques biomass can be an important renewable energy source biomass can be utilized for all three major energy needs electricity heatingcooling and transportation fuels however each usage is distinctly different from the others especially regarding efficiency - the percentage of energy utilized from the biomass source whereas pellets for heating can be up to 90 efficient bio-electricity plants are comparable to coal power plants with around 30 efficiency and biofuels from crops or algae even less biomass electric generation data combines two basic categories 1 wood and wood derived fuels including woodwood waste solids including paper pellets railroad ties utility poles wood chiips bark and wood waste solids wood waste liquids red liquor sludge wood spent sulfite liquor and other wood based liquids and black liquor and 2 other biomass fuels include municipal solid waste landfill gas sludge waste agricultural byproducts other biomass solids other biomass liquids and other biomass gases including digester gases methane and other biomass gases the contribution from these two categories over the last ten years of biomass electric power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the electric power generation for 2014 and 2015 this shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to fuel availability and needs  biofuelsedit most cars on the road today in the us can run on blends of up to 10 ethanol and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends ford daimlerchrysler and gm are among the automobile companies that sell flexible-fuel cars trucks and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85 ethanol e85 by mid-2006 there were approximately six million e85-compatible vehicles on us roads 91 the challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date 92 flex-fuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability the energy independence and security act of 2007 which calls for 15.2billion us gallons  58,000,000m3 of biofuels to be used annually by 2012 will also help to expand the market 91 the expanding ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction operations and maintenance mostly in rural communities according to the renewable fuels association the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 us jobs in 2005 alone boosting household income by $5.7 billion it also contributed about $3.5 billion in tax revenues at the local state and federal levels 91 on the other hand in 2010 the biofuel industry received $6644 million in federal government support 93 wave poweredit wave power in the united states is under development in several locations off the east  west coasts as well as hawaii it has moved beyond the research phase and is producing reliable energy its use to-date has been for situations where other forms of energy production are not economically viable and as such the power output is currently modest but major installations are planned to come on-line within the next few yearscitation needed renewable energy researchedit there are numerous organizations within the academic federal and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy this research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields 94 multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years two of the most prominent of these labs are sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory nrel both of which are funded by the united states department of energy and supported by various corporate partners 95 sandia has a total budget of $2.4 billion 96 while nrel has a budget of $375 million 97 both sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory nrel have heavily funded solar research programs british petroleum was also heavily invested in solar research programs until 2008 when the company began scaling back its solar operations the company finally shut down its forty-year-old solar business after executives decided solar power production is not economically competitive 98 the nrel solar program has a budget of around $75 million 99 and develops research projects in the areas of photovoltaic pv technology solar thermal energy and solar radiation 100 the budget for sandias solar division is unknown however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratorys $2.4 billion budget 101 several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years the solar energy research center serc at university of north carolina unc has the sole purpose of developing cost effective solar technology in 2008 researchers at massachusetts institute of technology mit developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water 102 such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining in february 2012 north carolina-based semprius inc a solar development company backed by german corporation siemens announced that they had developed the worlds most efficient solar panel the company claims that the prototype converts 33.9 of the sunlight that hits it to electricity more than double the previous high-end conversion rate 103 wind energy research dates back several decades to the 1970s when nasa developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds 104 today both sandia national laboratories and national renewable energy laboratory have programs dedicated to wind research sandias laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials aerodynamics and sensors 105 the nrel wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production reducing their capital costs and making wind energy more cost effective overall 106 the field laboratory for optimized wind energy flowe at caltech was established to research renewable approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost size and environmental impact of wind energy production 107 as the primary source of biofuels in north america many organizations are conducting research in the area of ethanol production on the federal level the usda conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the united states much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets 108 the national renewable energy laboratory has conducted various ethanol research projects mainly in the area of cellulosic ethanol 109 cellulosic ethanol has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol it does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood grasses or non-edible parts of plants 110 moreover some studies have shown cellulosic ethanol to be more cost effective and economically sustainable than corn-based ethanol 111 sandia national laboratories conducts in-house cellulosic ethanol research 112 and is also a member of the joint bioenergy institute jbei a research institute founded by the united states department of energy with the goal of developing cellulosic biofuels 113 over $1 billion of federal money has been spent on the research and development of hydrogen fuel in the united states 114 both the national renewable energy laboratory 115 and sandia national laboratories 116 have departments dedicated to hydrogen research policy and promotionedit in his january 24 2012 state of the union address president barack obama restated his commitment to renewable energy stating that he will not walk away from the promise of clean energy obama called for a commitment by the defense department to purchase 1,000 mw of renewable energy he also mentioned the long-standing interior department commitment to permit 10,000 mw of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012 16 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 included more than $70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs this policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in us history for renewable energy advanced transportation and energy conservation initiatives these new initiatives were expected to encourage many more utilities to strengthen their clean energy programs 117 while the department of energy has come under criticism for providing loan guarantees to solyndra 118 its sunshot initiative has funded successful companies such as energysage 119 and zep solar 120 initiativesedit sunshotedit in february 2011 the us department of energy doe launched its sunshot initiative a collaborative national effort to cut the total cost of photovoltaic solar energy systems by 75 by 2020 121 reaching this goal would make unsubsidized solar energy cost-competitive with other forms of electricity and get grid parity  122 the sunshot initiative included a crowdsourced innovation program run in partnership with topcoder during which 17 different solar energy application solutions were developed in 60 days  123 wind powering americaedit wind powering america wpa is another doe initiative that seeks to increase the use of wind energy wpa collaborates with state and regional stakeholders including farmers ranchers native americans rural electric cooperatives consumer-owned utilities and schoolscitation needed wpa has focused on states with strong potential for wind energy generation but with few operational projects wpa provides information about the challenges benefits and impacts of wind technology implementation solar america initiativeedit the solar america initiative sai 124 is a part of the federal advanced energy initiative to accelerate the development of advanced photovoltaic materials with the goal of making it cost-competitive with other forms of renewable electricity by

million solar roofs program california set a goal to create 3,000 megawatts of new solar-produced electricity by 2017 with funding of $2.8 billion 125 the california solar initiative offers cash incentives on solar pv systems of up to $2.50 a watt these incentives combined with federal tax incentives can cover up to 50 of the total cost of a solar panel system 125 financial incentives to support renewable energy are available in some other us states 126 epa facilitiesedit environmental protection agency facilities in the united states use renewable energy for all or part of their supply at the following facilities ada oklahoma geothermal heat pump ann arbor michigan fuel cell chicago illinois regional office photovoltaic array corvallis oregon photovoltaic array edison new jersey solar water heating gulf breeze florida solar lighting golden colorado wind power and transpired solar collector manchester washington wind power research triangle park north carolina photovoltaic solar panels and street lights 127 green power partnershipedit the epa named the top 20 partners in its green power partnership that are generating their own renewable energy on-site combined they generate more than 736 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy on-site each year enough to power more than 61,000 average us homes 128 renewable portfolio standardsedit a renewable portfolio standard refers to legislation that creates a market in tradeable renewable or green electricity certificates electricity distributors or wholesaler purchasers of electricity are required to source a specified percentage of their electricity portfolio from renewable generation sources liable entities that fall short of their quota can purchase certificates from accredited suppliers who have generated renewable electricity and obtained and registered certificates to sell on that market sales to the gridedit the energy policy act of 2005 requires all public electric utilities to facilitate net metering 129 this allows homes and businesses performing distributed generation to pay only the net cost of electricity from the grid electricity used minus electricity produced locally and sent back into the grid for intermittent renewable energy sources this effectively uses the grid as a battery to smooth over lulls and fill in production gaps some jurisdictions go one step further and have instituted feed-in tariff which allows any power customer to actually make money by producing more renewable energy than is consumed locally distribution effectsedit from 2006-14 us households received more than $18 billion in federal income tax credits for weatherizing their homes installing solar panels buying hybrid and electric vehicles and other clean energy investments these tax expenditures went predominantly to higher-income americans the bottom three income quintiles received about 10 of all credits while the top quintile received about 60 the most extreme is the program aimed at electric vehicles where the top income quintile received about 90 of all credits market mechanisms have less skewed distributional effects 130 renewable energy organizationsedit the american council on renewable energy acore is a non-profit organization with headquarters in washington dc it was founded in 2001 as a unifying forum for bringing renewable energy into the mainstream of americans economy and lifestyle in 2010 acore had over 700 member organizations 131 in 2007 acore published outlook on renewable energy in america a two volume report about the future of renewable energy in the united states 132 it has been said that this report exposes a new reality for renewable energy in america 133 the environmental and energy study institute eesi is a non-profit organization which promotes environmentally sustainable societies founded in 1984 by a group of congressional members eesi seeks to be a catalyst that moves society away from environmentally damaging fossil fuels and toward a clean energy future eesi presents policy solutions that will result in decreased global warming and air pollution improvements in public health energy security and rural economic development opportunities increased use of renewable energy sources and improved energy efficiency an important part of the mission of the national renewable energy laboratory nrel is the transfer of nrel-developed technologies to renewable energy markets nrels technology transfer office supports laboratory scientists and engineers in the successful and practical application of their expertise and the technologies they develop rd staff and facilities are recognized and valued by industry as demonstrated through many collaborative research projects and licensed technologies with
