wealth wealth is the abundance of valuable resources or valuable material possessions this includes the core meaning as held in the originating old english word weal which is from an indo-european word stem 1 an individual community region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources to the benefit of the common good is known as wealthy the modern concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of economics and clearly so for growth economics and development economics yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent at the most general level economists may define wealth as anything of value that captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different contexts 2 defining wealth can be a normative process with various ethical implications since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own 3 4 the united nations definition of inclusive wealth is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural human and physical assets 5 6 natural capital includes land

wealthedit adam smith in his seminal work the wealth of nations described wealth as the annual produce of the land and labour of the society this produce is at its simplest that which satisfies human needs and wants of utility in popular usage wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic value or the state of controlling or possessing such items usually in the form of money real estate and personal property an individual who is considered wealthy affluent or rich is someone who has accumulated substantial wealth relative to others in their society or reference group in economics net worth refers to the value of assets owned minus the value of liabilities owed at a point in timecitation needed wealth can be categorized into three principal categories personal property including homes or automobiles monetary savings such as the accumulation of past income and the capital wealth of income producing assets including real estate stocks bonds and businessescitation needed all these delineations make wealth an especially important part of social stratification wealth provides a type of individual safety net of protection against an unforeseen decline in ones living standard in the event of job loss or other emergency and can be transformed into home ownership business ownership or even a college educationcitation needed wealth refers to some accumulation of resources net asset value whether abundant or not richness refers to an abundance of such resources income or flow a wealthy individual community or nation thus has more accumulated resources capital than a poor one the opposite of wealth is destitution the opposite of richness is poverty the term implies a social contract on establishing and maintaining ownership in relation to such items which can be invoked with little or no effort and expense on the part of the owner the concept of wealth is relative and not only varies between societies but varies between different sections or regions in the same society a personal net worth of us $10,000 in most parts of the united states would certainly not place a person among the wealthiest citizens of that locale however such an amount would constitute an extraordinary amount of wealth in impoverished developing countries concepts of wealth also vary across time modern labor-saving inventions and the development of the sciences have vastly improved the standard of living in modern societies for even the poorest of people this comparative wealth across time is also applicable to the future given this trendcitation needed of human advancement it is possible that the standard of living that the wealthiest enjoy today will be considered impoverished by future generations industrialization emphasized the role of technology many jobs were automated machines replaced some workers while other workers became more specialized labour specialization became critical to economic success however physical capital as it came to be known consisting of both the natural capital and the infrastructural capital became the focus of the analysis of wealthcitation needed adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials labour land and technology in such a way as to capture a profit excess above the cost of production 8 the theories of david ricardo john locke john stuart mill in the 18th century and 19th century built on these views of wealth that we now call classical economics marxian economics see labor theory of value distinguishes in the grundrisse between material wealth and human wealth defining human wealth as wealth in human relations land and labour were the source of all material wealth the german cultural historian silvio vietta links wealthpoverty to rationality having a leading position in the development of rational sciences in new technologies and in economic production leads to wealth while the opposite can be correlated with poverty 9 10 amount of wealth in the worldedit the wealth of households amounts to usd 241 trillion  2013 and is estimated to increase by 40 in five years the us net worth of $100 trillion and switzerlands usd 0.51 millioninhabitant are the highest numbers in the world 11 the credit suisse wealth report mid-2013 estimated that once debts had been subtracted an adult required just usd 4,000 in assets to be within the wealthiest 50 of world citizens however at least usd 75,000 was needed to reach the top 10 and usd 753,000 to belong to the most wealthy 1 12 tim harford has asserted that a small child has greater wealth than the 2 billion poorest people in the world combined since a small child has no debt 13 philosophical analysisedit in western civilization wealth is connected with a quantitative type of thought invented in the ancient greek revolution of rationality involving for instance the quantitative analysis of nature the rationalization of warfare and measurement in economics 9 10 the invention of coined money and banking was particularly important aristotle describes the basic function of money as a universal instrument of quantitative measurement  for it measures all things  making things alike and comparable due to a social agreement of acceptance 14 in that way money also enables a new type of economic society and the definition of wealth in measurable quantities in the roman empire just as in modern colonialism the main force behind the conquest of countries was the exploitation and accumulation of wealth in quantitative values like gold and money modern philosophers like nietzsche criticized the fixation on measurable wealth unsere reichen  das sind die ärmsten der eigentliche zweck alles reichtums ist vergessen our rich people  those are the poorest the real purpose of all wealth has been forgotten 15 economic analysisedit in economics wealth in a commonly applied accounting sense sometimes savings is the net worth of a person household or nation that is the value of all assets owned net of all liabilities owed at a point in time for national wealth as measured in the national accounts the net liabilities are those owed to the rest of the world 16 the term may also be used more broadly as referring to the productive capacity of a society or as a contrast to poverty 17 analytical emphasis may be on its determinants or distribution 18 economic terminology distinguishes between wealth and income wealth or savings is a stock variable that is measurable at a date in time for example the value of an orchard on december 31 minus debt owed on the orchard for a given amount of wealth say at the beginning of the year income from that wealth as measurable over say a year is a flow variable what marks the income as a flow is its measurement per unit of time such as the value of apples yielded from the orchard per year in macroeconomic theory the wealth effect may refer to the increase in aggregate consumption from an increase in national wealth one measure of it is the wealth elasticity of demand it is the percentage change in the amount demanded of consumption for each one-percent change in wealth wealth may be measured in nominal or real values that is in money value as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes the assets include those that are tangible land and capital and financial money bonds etc measurable wealth typically excludes intangible or nonmarketable assets such as human capital and social capital in economics wealth corresponds to the accounting term net worth but analysis may adapt typical accounting conventions for economic purposes in social accounting such as in national accounts an example of the latter is generational accounting of social security systems to include the present value projected future outlays considered to be liabilities 19 macroeconomic questions include whether the issuance of government bonds affects investment and consumption through the wealth effect 20 environmental assets are not usually counted in measuring wealth in part due to the difficulty of valuation for a non-market good environmental or green accounting is a method of social accounting for formulating and deriving such measures on the argument that an educated valuation is superior to a value of zero as the implied valuation of environmental assets 21 sociological treatmentsedit wealth and social classedit social class is not identical to wealth but the two concepts are related particularly in marxist theory leading to the combined concept of socioeconomic status wealth refers to value of everything a person or family owns this includes tangible items such as jewelry housing cars and other personal property financial assets such as stocks and bonds which can be traded for cash also contribute to wealth wealth is measured as net assets minus how much debt one owes wealth is a restrictive agent for people of different classes because some hobbies can only be participated in by the affluent such as world travel partly as a result of different economic conditions of life members of different social classes often have different value systems and view the world in different ways as such there exist different conceptions of social reality different aspirations and hopes and fears different conceptions of the desirable 22 the way the various social classes in society view wealth vary and these diverse characteristics are a fundamental dividing line among the classes according to richard h ropers the concentration of wealth in the united states is inequitably distributed 23 in 1996 the united states federal government reported that the net worth of the top 1 percent of people in the united states was approximately equal to that of the bottom 90 percent cross-nationally the united states has greater wealth inequality than other developed nationscitation needed the upper classedit upper class encompasses the top end of the income spectrum relative members of society as a whole since they have more wealth and privacy the upper class has more personal autonomy than the rest of the population upper class values include higher education and the wealthiest people the accumulation and maintenance of wealth the maintenance of social networks and the power that accompanies such networks children of the upper class are typically schooled on how to manage this power and channel this privilege in different forms it is in large part by accessing various edifices of informationclarification needed associates procedures and auspices that the upper class are able to maintain their wealth and pass it to future generations 24 usually people of the upper class participate as partisans in elections and have more political power than those of lower classes due to their abundance of resources and influence the middle classedit middle class encompasses the individuals who fall in between the upper and lower class relative to their financial situation generally the population of america associates themselves as middle class lifestyle is a means for which individuals or families decide what to consume with their money and their way of living the middle class places a greater emphasis on income unlike the upper class the middle class measures success and potential in the form of money relative pennies rather than influence and power the middle class views wealth as something for emergencies and it is seen as more of a cushion this class comprises people that were raised with families that typically owned their own home planned ahead and stressed the importance of education and achievement they earn a significant amount of income and also have significant amounts of consumption however there is very limited savings deferred consumption or investments besides retirement pensions and home ownership they have been socialized to accumulate wealth through structured institutionalized arrangements without this set structure asset accumulation would likely not occur 24 the lower classedit those with the least amount of wealth are the poor most of the institutions that the poor encounter discourage any accumulation of assets 24 lower class members feel more restrictive in their options due to their lack of wealth this could lead to complications in solving their personal dilemmas as predicted by the class structure hypothesis there are many societal standards and designs intentional sabotage and shortcomings to explain the persistent state of yearning and want the lower classes generally experience with their lower quality and quantity of assets typical causes are persistent unethicalharmful mentalities and criminal tendencies misguidedly similar to the upper class in some cases distributionedit although precise data are not available the total household wealth in the world excluding human capital has been estimated at $125 trillion usd 125×1012 in year 2000 25 including human capital the united nations estimated it in 2008 to be $118 trillion in the united states alone 5 6 according to the kuznets hypothesis inequality of wealth and income increases during the early phases of economic development stabilizes and then becomes more equitable about 90 of global wealth is distributed in north america europe and rich asia-pacific countries not including india 26 and in 2008 1 of adults were estimated to hold 40 of world wealth a number which falls to 32 when adjusted for purchasing power parity 27 in 2013 1 of adults were estimated to hold 46 of world wealth 28 and around $18.5 trillion was estimated to be stored in tax havens worldwide 29 wealth in the form of landedit in the western tradition the concepts of owning land and accumulating wealth in the form of land were engendered in the rise of the first state for a primary service and power of government was and is to this day the awarding and adjudication of land use rightscitation needed land ownership was also justified according to john locke he claimed that because we mixclarification needed our labour with the land we thereby deserve the right to control the use of the land and benefit from the product of that land but subject to his lockean proviso of at least where there is enough and as good left in common for others additionally in developed countries post-agrarian society industrial society this argument has many critics including those influenced by georgist and geolibertarian ideas who argue that since land by definition is not a product of human labor any claim of private property in it is a form of theft as david lloyd george observed to prove a legal title to land one must trace it back to the man who stole it many older ideas have resurfaced in the modern notions of ecological stewardship bioregionalism natural capital and ecological economics anthropological viewsedit anthropology characterizes societies in part based on a societys concept of wealth and the institutional structures and power used to protect this wealthcitation needed several types are defined below they can be viewed as an evolutionary progression many young adolescents have become wealthy from the inheritance of their families the interpersonal conceptedit early hominids seem to have started with incipient ideas of wealthcitation needed similar to that of the great apes but as tools clothing and other mobile infrastructural capital became important to survival especially in hostile biomes ideas such as the inheritance of wealth political positions leadership and ability to control group movements to perhaps reinforce such power emerged neandertal societies had pooled funerary rites and cave painting which implies at least a notion of shared assets that could be spent for social purposes or preserved for social purposes wealth may have been collective accumulation of non-necessitiesedit humans back to and including the cro-magnons seem to have had clearly defined rulers and status hierarchiescitation needed digs in russia at the sungir archaeological site have revealed elaborate funeral clothing on a man and a pair of children buried there approximately 28,000 years agocitation needed this indicates a considerable accumulation of wealth by some individuals or families the high artisan skill also suggest the capacity to direct specialized labor to tasks that are not of any obvious utility to the groups survivalcitation needed control of arable landedit the rise of irrigation and urbanization especially in ancient sumer and later egypt unified the ideas of wealth and control of land and agriculture to feed a large stable population it was possible and necessary to achieve universal cultivation and city-state protection the notion of the state and the notion of war are said to have emerged at this time tribal cultures were formalized into what we would call feudal systems and many rights and obligations were assumed by the monarchy and related aristocracy protection of infrastructural capital built up over generations became critical city walls irrigation systems sewage systems aqueducts buildings all impossible to replace within a single generation and thus a matter of social survival to maintain the social capital of entire societies was often defined in terms of its relation to infrastructural capital eg castles or forts or an allied monastery cathedral or temple and natural capital ie the land that supplied locally grown food agricultural economics continues these traditions in the analyses of modern agricultural policy and related ideas of wealth eg the ark of taste model of agricultural wealth the role of technologyedit industrialization emphasized the role of technology many jobs were automated machines replaced some workers while other workers became more specialized labour specialization became critical to economic success however physical capital as it came to be known consisting of both the natural capital raw materials from nature and the infrastructural capital facilitating technology became the focus of the analysis of wealth adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials labour land and technology in such a way as to capture a profit excess above the cost of production 8 see alsoedit national wealth economics gross national happiness happiness economics productivity
