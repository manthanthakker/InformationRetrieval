waste management waste management is all the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal 1 this includes amongst other things collection transport treatment and disposal of waste together with monitoring and regulation it also encompasses the legal and regulatory framework that relates to waste management encompassing guidance on recycling etc the term normally relates to all kinds of waste whether generated during the extraction of raw materials the processing of raw materials into intermediate and final products the consumption of final products or other human activities 1 including municipal residential institutional commercial agricultural and social health care household hazardous wastes sewage sludge 2 waste management is intended to reduce adverse effects of waste on health the environment or aesthetics waste management practices are not uniform among countries developed and developing nations regions urban and rural

waste managementedit there are a number of concepts about waste management which vary in their usage between countries or regions some of the most general widely used concepts include waste hierarchyedit the waste hierarchy refers to the "3 rs reduce reuse and recycle which classify waste management strategies according to their desirability in terms of waste minimisation the waste hierarchy remains the cornerstone of most waste minimisation strategies the aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of waste see resource recoverythe waste hierarchy is represented as a pyramid because the basic premise is for policy to take action first and prevent the generation of waste the next step or preferred action is to reduce the generation of waste ie by re-use the next is recycling which would include composting following this step is material recovery and waste-to-energy energy can be recovered from processes ie landfill and combustion at this level of the hierarchy the final action is disposal in landfills or through incineration without energy recovery this last step is the final resort for waste which has not been prevented diverted or recovered 4 the waste hierarchy represents the progression of a product or material through the sequential stages of the pyramid of waste management the hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product 4 life-cycle of a productedit the life-cycle begins with design then proceeds through manufacture distribution use and then follows through the waste hierarchys stages of reduce reuse and recycle each of the above stages of the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention to rethink the need for the product to redesign to minimize waste potential to extend its use 4 the key behind the life-cycle of a product is to optimize the use of the worlds limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste resource efficiencyedit resource efficiency reflects the understanding that current global economic growth and development can not be sustained with the current production and consumption patterns globally we are extracting more resources to produce goods than the planet can replenish 4 resource efficiency is the reduction of the environmental impact from the production and consumption of these goods from final raw material extraction to last use and disposal this process of resource efficiency can address sustainability polluter pays principleedit the polluter pays principle is a principle where the polluting party pays for the impact caused to the environment with respect to waste management this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal of the unrecoverable material historyedit throughout most of history the amount of waste generated by humans was insignificant due to low population density and low societal levels of the exploitation of natural resources common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human biodegradable waste and these were released back into the ground locally with minimum environmental impact tools made out of wood or metal were generally reused or passed down through the generations however some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others in particular the maya of central america had a fixed monthly ritual in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps 5 modern eraedit following the onset of industrialisation and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in england the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of sanitation and the general quality of urban life the streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance regulations 6 calls for the establishment of a municipal authority with waste removal powers occurred as early as 1751 when corbyn morris in london proposed that as the preservation of the health of the people is of great importance it is proposed that the cleaning of this city should be put under one uniform public management and all the filth beconveyed by the thames to proper distance in the country 7 however it was not until the mid-19th century spurred by increasingly devastating cholera outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first legislation on the issue emerged highly influential in this new focus was the report the sanitary condition of the labouring population in 1842 8 of the social reformer edwin chadwick in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the citys population in the uk the nuisance removal and disease prevention act of 1846 began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste management in london the metropolitan board of works was the first city-wide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the public health act 1875 made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in moveable receptacles for disposalthe first concept for a dust-bin 9 the dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first incineration plants or as they were then called destructors in 1874 the first incinerator was built in nottingham by manlove alliott  co ltd to the design of albert fryer 7 however these were met with opposition on account of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the neighbouring areas 10 similar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the 20th century in other large cities of europe and north america in 1895 new york city became the first us city with public-sector garbage management 9 early garbage removal trucks were simply open bodied dump trucks pulled by a team of horses they became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first close body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in britain 11 these were soon equipped with hopper mechanisms where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck the garwood load packer was the first truck in 1938 to incorporate a hydraulic compactor waste handling and transportedit waste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste some areas especially those in less developed countries do not have formal waste-collection systems waste handling practicesedit curbside collection is the most common method of disposal in most european countries canada new zealand and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks this is often associated with curb-side waste segregation in rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility in some areas vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes systems are in use in europe and north america pyrolysis is used to dispose of some wastes including tires a process that can produce recovered fuels steel and heat in some cases tires can provide the feedstock for cement manufacture such systems are used in usa california australia greece mexico the united kingdom and in israel the resem pyrolysis plant that has been operational at texas usa since december 2011 and processes up to 60 tons per day 12 in some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste salvaging recyclables and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner in san francisco the local government established its mandatory recycling and composting ordinance in support of its goal of zero waste by 2020 requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill the three streams are collected with the curbside fantastic 3 bin system - blue for recyclables green for compostables and black for landfill-bound materials - provided to residents and businesses and serviced by san franciscos sole refuse hauler recology the citys pay-as-you-throw system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards the citys department of the environments zero waste program has led the city to achieve 80 diversion the highest diversion rate in north america 13 other businesses such as waste industries use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans financial modelsedit in most developed countries domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income or notional house value commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs this practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and recycling in some areas such as taipei the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce waste will only be collected by the city council if waste is disposed in government issued rubbish bags this policy has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling ratecitation needed disposal solutionsedit landfilledit incinerationedit incineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products this method is useful for disposal of residue of both solid waste management and solid residue from waste water management this process reduces the volumes of solid waste to 20 to 30 percent of the original volume incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as thermal treatment incinerators convert waste materials into heat gas steam and ash incineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry it is used to dispose of solid liquid and gaseous waste it is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain hazardous waste materials such as biological medical waste incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal due to issues such as emission of gaseous pollutants incineration is common in countries such as japan where land is more scarce as these facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills waste-to-energy wte or energy-from-waste efw are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat steam or electricity combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks particular concern has focused on some very persistent organic compounds such as dioxins furans and pahs which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences recyclingedit recycling is a resource recovery practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers the materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles a procedure called kerbside collection in some communities the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins eg for paper plastics metals prior to its collection in other communities all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection and the sorting is handled later at a central facility the latter method is known as single-stream recycling 14 15 the most common consumer products recycled include aluminium such as beverages cans copper such as wire steel from food and aerosol cans old steel furnishings or equipment rubber tyres polyethylene and pet bottles glass bottles and jars paperboard cartons newspapers magazines and light paper and corrugated fiberboard boxes pvc ldpe pp and ps see resin identification code are also recyclable these items are usually composed of a single type of material making them relatively easy to recycle into new products the recycling of complex products such as computers and electronic equipment is more difficult due to the additional dismantling and separation required the type of material accepted for recycling varies by city and country each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials however certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed re-useedit biological reprocessingedit recoverable materials that are organic in nature such as plant material food scraps and paper products can be recovered through composting and digestion processes to decompose the organic matter the resulting organic material is then recycled as mulch or compost for agricultural or landscaping purposes in addition waste gas from the process such as methane can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat chpcogeneration maximising efficiencies the intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter see resource recovery energy recoveryedit energy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat electricity or fuel through a variety of processes including combustion gasification pyrolyzation anaerobic digestion and landfill gas recovery 16 this process is often called waste-to-energy energy recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills 16 globally waste-to-energy accounts for 16 of waste management 17 the energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel see above to fuel for boilers to generate steam and electricity in a turbine pyrolysis and gasification are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited oxygen availability the process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high pressure pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid liquid and gas products the liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products chemical refinery the solid residue char can be further refined into products such as activated carbon gasification and advanced plasma arc gasification are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas syngas composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen the gas is then burnt to produce electricity and steam an alternative to pyrolysis is high temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition hydrothermal monophasic oxidation pyrolysisedit pyrolysis is a process of thermo-chemical decomposition of organic materials by heat in the absence of oxygen which produces various hydrocarbon gases 18 during pyrolysis the molecules of object are subjected to very high temperatures leading to very high vibrations therefore every molecule in the object is stretched and shaken to an extent that molecules starts breaking down the rate of pyrolysis increases with temperature in industrial applications temperatures are above 430c  800f 19 fast pyrolysis produces liquid fuel for feedstocks like wood slow pyrolysis produces gases and solid charcoal 20 pyrolysis hold promise for conversion of waste biomass into useful liquid fuel pyrolysis of waste plastics can produce millions of litres of fuel solid products of this process contain metals glass sand and pyrolysis coke which cannot be converted to gas in the process resource recoveryedit resource recovery is the systematic diversion of waste which was intended for disposal for a specific next use 21 it is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources or convert to energy 22 these activities are performed at a resource recovery facility 22 resource recovery is not only environmentally important but it is also cost effective 23 it decreases the amount of waste for disposal saves space in landfills and conserves natural resources 23 resource recovery as opposed to waste management uses lca life cycle analysis attempts to offer alternatives to waste management for mixed msw municipal solid waste a number of broad studies have indicated that administration source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the non-organic fraction and energy and compostfertilizer production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured path as an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial many of the items thrown away contain precious metals which can be recycled to create a profit such as the components in circuit boards other industries can also benefit from resource recycling with the wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials being passed onto sectors such as the horticultural profession in this instance workers can use the recycled chips to create paths walkways or arena surfaces sustainabilityedit the management of waste is a key component in a business ability to maintaining iso14001 accreditation companies are encouraged to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through resource recovery practices which are sustainability-related activities one way to do this is by shifting away from waste management to resource recovery practices like recycling materials such as glass food scraps paper and cardboard plastic bottles and metal a lot of conferences will discuss this topic as the international conference on green urabnism which will be held in italy from 12–14 october 2016 avoidance and reduction methodsedit an important method of waste management is the prevention of waste material being created also known as waste reduction methods of avoidance include reuse of second-hand products repairing broken items instead of buying new designing products to be refillable or reusable such as cotton instead of plastic shopping bags encouraging consumers to avoid using disposable products such as disposable cutlery removing any foodliquid remains from cans and packaging 24 and designing products that use less material to achieve the same purpose for example lightweighting of beverage cans 25 international waste movementedit while waste transport within a given country falls under national regulations trans-boundary movement of waste is often subject to international treaties a major concern to many countries in the world has been hazardous waste the basel convention ratified by 172 countries deprecates movement of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries the provisions of the basel convention have been integrated into the eu waste shipment regulation nuclear waste although considered hazardous does not fall under the jurisdiction of the basel convention benefitsedit waste is not something that should be discarded or disposed of with no regard for future use it can be a valuable resource if addressed correctly through policy and practice with rational and consistent waste management practices there is an opportunity to reap a range of benefits those benefits include challenges in developing countriesedit waste management in cities with developing economies and economies in transition experience exhausted waste collection services inadequately managed and uncontrolled dumpsites and the problems are worsening 4 problems with governance also complicate the situation waste management in these countries and cities is an ongoing challenge and many struggle due to weak institutions chronic under-resourcing and rapid urbanization 4 all of these challenges along with the lack of understanding of different factors that contribute to the hierarchy of waste management affect the treatment of waste 26 technologiesedit traditionally the waste management industry has been a late adopter of new technologies such as rfid radio frequency identification tags gps and integrated software packages which enable better quality data to be collected without the use of estimation or manual data entry 27 scientific journalsedit related scientific journals in this area include environmental and resource economics environmental monitoring
