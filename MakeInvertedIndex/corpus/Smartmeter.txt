smart meter a smart meter is an electronic device that records consumption of electric energy in intervals of an hour or less and communicates that information at least daily back to the utility for monitoring and billing 7 smart meters enable two-way communication between the meter and the central system unlike home energy monitors smart meters can gather data for remote reporting such an advanced metering infrastructure ami differs from traditional automatic meter reading amr in that it enables two-way communications with the meter  contents 1 overview 2 brief history 3 purpose 4

smart meter often refers to an electricity meter but it also may mean a device measuring natural gas or water consumption similar meters usually referred to as interval or time-of-use meters have existed for years but smart meters usually involve real-time or near real-time sensors power outage notification and power quality monitoring these additional features are more than simple automated meter reading amr they are similar in many respects to advanced metering infrastructure ami meters interval and time-of-use meters historically have been installed to measure commercial and industrial customers but may not have automatic reading research by which the uk consumer group showed that as many as one in three confuse smart meters with energy monitors also known as in-home display monitors 8 the roll-out of smart meters is one strategy for energy savings while energy suppliers in the uk could save around £300 million a year from their introduction consumer benefits will depend on people actively changing their energy use for example time of use tariffs offering lower rates at off-peak times and selling electricity back to the grid with net metering may also benefit consumers the installed base of smart meters in europe at the end of 2008 was about 39 million units according to analyst firm berg insight 9 globally pike research found that smart meter shipments were 17.4 million units for the first quarter of 2011 10 visiongain has determined that the value of the global smart meter market will reach $7bn in 2012 11 smart meters may be part of a smart grid but alone they do not constitute a smart grid 12 brief historyedit in 1972 theodore george ted paraskevakos while working with boeing in huntsville alabama developed a sensor monitoring system that used digital transmission for security fire and medical alarm systems as well as meter reading capabilities for all utilities this technology was a spin-off of the automatic telephone line identification system now known as caller id in 1974 mr paraskevakos was awarded a us patent for this technology 13 in 1977 he launched metretek inc 7 which developed and produced the first fully automated commercially available remote meter reading and load management system since this system was developed pre-internet metretek utilized the ibm series 1 mini-computer for this approach mr paraskevakos and metretek were awarded multiple patents 14 purposeedit since the inception of electricity deregulation and market-driven pricing throughout the world utilities have been looking for a means to match consumption with generation traditional electrical and gas meters only measure total consumption and so provide no information of when the energy was consumed at each metered site 15 smart meters provide a way of measuring this site-specific information allowing utility companies to introduce different prices for consumption based on the time of day and the season 16 utility companies propose that from a consumer perspective smart metering offers potential benefits to householders these include a an end to estimated bills which are a major source of complaints for many customers b a tool to help consumers better manage their energy purchases - stating that smart meters with a display outside their homes could provide up-to-date information on gas and electricity consumption and in doing so help people to manage their energy use and reduce their energy bills electricity pricing usually peaks at certain predictable times of the day and the season in particular if generation is constrained prices can rise if power from other jurisdictions or more costly generation is brought online proponents assert that billing customers at a higher rate for peak times will encourage consumers to adjust their consumption habits to be more responsive to market prices and assert further that regulatory and market design agencies hope these price signals could delay the construction of additional generation or at least the purchase of energy from higher priced sources thereby controlling the steady and rapid increase of electricity pricescitation needed there are some concerns however that low income and vulnerable consumers may not benefit from intraday time-of-use tariffs an academic study based on existing trials showed that homeowners electricity consumption on average is reduced by approximately 3-5 17 the ability to connectdisconnect service and read meter consumption remotely are major labor savings for the utility and can result in large layoffs of meter readers 18 implementation examplesedit the american council for an energy-efficient economy reviewed more than 36 different residential smart metering and feedback programmes internationally this is the most extensive study of its kind as of january 2011 their conclusion was to realise potential feedback-induced savings advanced meters smart meters must be used in conjunction with in-home or on-line displays and well-designed programmes that successfully inform engage empower and motivate people 19 there are near universal calls from both the energy industry and consumer groups for a national social marketing campaign to help raise awareness of smart metering and give customers the information and support they need to become more energy efficient and what changes they must make to realize the potential of proposed smart meters australiaedit in 2004 the essential services commission of victoria australia esc released its changes to the electricity customer metering code and procedure to implement its decision to mandate interval meters for 2.6 million victorian electricity customers the escs final paper titled mandatory rollout of interval meters for electricity customers foreshadowed the changes to be implemented and contained the rollout timetable requiring interval meters to be installed for all small businesses and residences the rollout commenced in mid-2009 and was completed at the end of 2013 20 the commonwealth issued a joint communiqué at the council of australian governments meeting in canberra on 10 february 2006 committing all governments to the progressive rollout of smart metering technology from 2007 21 in 2009 the victorian auditor general undertook a review of the program and found that there were significant inadequacies in advice to government and that project governance has not been appropriate 22 meters installed in victoria have been deployed with limited smart functionality that is being increased over time 30-minute interval data is available remote cut-off and start-up energization is available and the home area network will be available for households in 2012 in may 2010 it was reported that the program was expected to cost $500 million more than originally estimated by proponents with a total cost of $1.6 billion 23 in november 2010 the victorian labor party was voted out of state government the incoming coalition stated that the meter program would be reviewed and the auditor generals recommendations implemented specifically commenting on program governance customer data protection and cost recovery 24 in january 2011 the energy minister michael obrien said he was not ruling out a suspension of the program 25 this review delivered in december 2012 endorsed the continuation of the roll out with minor changes 26 the victorian government after initially halting the planned implementation of time-of-use tariffs 27 for general consumers has now allowed their introduction from mid-2013 28 as shown in the chart below victorian metering charges increased by approximately $60 per meter per year after the introduction of ami cost recovery from customers in 2010 and a projected increase to 125.73 by 2016-2017 29 by mid-july 2013 the first smart meter in-home displays were being made available to victorian consumers 30 at the beginning of 2014 there were three approved smart meter in-home displays directly available to consumers 31 annual meter charge increases with smart meter costs in 2010 and projections to 2017  canadaedit the ontario energy board in ontario canada has worked to define the technology  32 and develop the regulatory framework for its implementation the government of ontario set a target of deploying smart meters to 800,000 homes and small businesses ie small general service customers under 50kw demand by the end of 2007 which was surpassed and throughout the province by the end of 2010 33 bc hydro in british columbia canada has implemented itron smart meters to most of its customers by the end of 2012 34 smart meter installations have been associated with several fires in canada but these were probably caused by preexisting problems unrelated to the meters 35 bc hydro maintains that the risk of a smart meter installation causing an electrical problem is extremely low and will assist homeowners if repairs are necessary for a safe installation in november 2011 the union of british columbia municipalities voted in favour of a moratorium to temporarily suspend smart meter installations 36 the provincial government insists that installations will proceed based on global standards 36 as of may 2012 39 municipalities in british columbia have passed motions opposing the installation of smart meters the utility company bc hydro is not legally obliged to abide by these city decisions 37 in september 2013 bc hydro announced the meter choices program which allows customers to keep their old meter or have a smart meter with the radio off both options have an additional monthly negative option fee of $30.00 per month 38 italyedit the worlds largest smart meter deployment was undertaken by enel spa the dominant utility in italy with more than 30 million customers between 2000 and 2005 enel deployed smart meters to its entire customer base these meters are fully electronic and smart with integrated bi-directional communications advanced power measurement and management capabilities an integrated software-controllable disconnect switch and an all solid-state design they communicate over low voltage power line using standards-based power line technology from echelon corporation to echelon data concentrators at which point they communicate via ip to enels enterprise servers demonstrating that with power line communication smart meters dont require wifi radios 39 the system provides a wide range of advanced features including the ability to remotely turn power on or off to a customer read usage information from a meter detect a service outage change the maximum amount of electricity that a customer may demand at any time detect unauthorized use of electricity and remotely shut it off and remotely change the meters billing plan from credit to prepay as well as from flat-rate to multi-tariff japanedit the energy conservation center  40 in japan promotes energy efficiency including smart metering public utilities have started to test metering with integrated communication devices private entities have already implemented efficient energy systems with integrated feedback methods such as alerts or triggers netherlandsedit the company oxxio introduced the first smart meter for both electricity and gas in the netherlands in 2005 in 2007 the dutch government proposed that all seven million households of the country should have a smart meter by 2013 as part of a national energy reduction plan in august 2008 the roll out of these seven million meters was delayed for several reasons main reasons for the delay were that there was limited possibility foreseen to register small scale local energy production eg by solar panels and that there was uncertainty in the parliament on future developments in smart meters on april 7 2009 the dutch government had to back down after consumer groups raised privacy concerns instead of a mandatory roll-out smart meters will be voluntary 41 new zealandedit in november 2005 energy supplier meridian energy introduced the usage of smart meters in the central hawkes bay area with more than 1000 households participating by late 2006 over 6,300 smart meters had been installed as part of the initial trial on june 28 2007 the first roll-out began for households in christchurch  42 and there are plans to install more than 112,000 smart meters by january 2009 43 these smart meters are made by a christchurch-based company arc innovations which is a wholly owned subsidiary of meridian energy in june 2009 the parliamentary commissioner for the environment released a report 44 which was critical of the lack of smartness in the 150,000 smart meters installed in new zealand thus far dr jan wright called for government leadership for this infrastructure of national importance dr wright emphasised that the meters were capable of being smart but that the failure to include the han chips at the initial installation meant that currently only the power retailers benefited not consumers nor the environment in 2015 the new zealand office of the privacy commissioner raised concerns that smart meters recorded personal information including the time that homeowners were home or not the office said the smart meter readings undoubtedly contained private information and power companies needed to be more upfront about their handling of the torrent of personal information gathered by smart meters 45 nordic countriesedit northern europe became the hotspot for amm advanced metering management in europe in 2003 when sweden announced the decision to require monthly readings of all electricity meters by 2009 soon activities spread to the other nordic countries vattenfall fortum and eon decided to deploy amm in finland as well as in sweden as the leading industry players in both countries at the time developments in denmark took off in 2004 with several ambitious projects being announced by the countrys largest utilities norway has taken a more cautious stance but in june 2007 the norwegian energy authority nve declared that it would recommend new legislation requiring smart meters to take effect in 2013 as of august 2007 almost all of the dsos in sweden had signed contracts for amm solutions norway was lagging behind with just 6 percent altogether contracts for nearly 8 million smart meters are still open in the nordic region spainedit information gathered from smartregions program 46 summary of the european smartmettering deployment 47  48 spain is a country with 46 million

spain related to implementation of smart meters rd 1634/2006 order to the regulator comisión nacional de energía cne about a substitution plan including the substitution plan for all spanish residential meters criteria for the substitution and number of meters to install every year percentage of the total equipment orden itc/3860/2007 publication of the criteria for the substitution plan including that every distributor has to present its own plan and amm system design based on the royal decrees a meter substitution plan was established with an obligation to install smart meters for all consumers under 15kw by 2018 by 31 december 2010 30 of the contracts from each distribution company below 15kw should have the smart meter installed distribution companies are responsible for the installation of the meters the smart metering obligations were established in december 2007 with the national meter substitution plan for end-users up to 15kw the aim is to support remote energy management systems the plan is managed by the ministry of industry with a deadline for the completion of the plan by 31 december 2018 all dsos had to submit their substitution plans to the regional governments a binding target of 30 of all customers was set for 2010 this initial target could not be reached by any of the dsos however due to a late approval of the substitution plan in may 2009 technological uncertainties in terms of system communication alleged supply problems of certified meters that were available only in june 2010 and ongoing negotiations with the regulators about the level of cost acceptance united kingdomedit in august 2007 the uk government consulted on smart meter roll-out the consultation attached the necessary draft regulations and proposed that from 2008 domestic customers provide comparative historical consumption data and electricity suppliers provide a real-time display unit within time limits and for business gas and electricity suppliers install smart meters in those parts of the sme sector where it has been shown to be cost-effective to do so and where such a meter is not already installed 49 in december 2009 the united kingdoms department of energy and climate change announced its intention to have smart meters in all homes in great britain by 2020 50 the model is a competitive-supplier-led rollout with a central communications body called the data and communications company dcc which was established in september 2013 as well as the dcc the government established smart energy gb to lead the nationwide publicity for the rollout programme 51 the united kingdom rollout is considered to be the largest programme ever undertaken  involving visits to 30 million homes and 2 million small businesses to replace meters for both gas and electricity most households will have smart meters installed by their energy company between 2015 and 2020 although some energy companies are starting to install smart meters already 52 at the end of 2013 there were 295,700 smart meters installed in domestic properties in great britain 53 in order to decide whether or not to mandate the rollout of smart meters impact assessments by government help establish if there is a positive business case for britain to roll out smart metering these look at the potential costs and benefits of rolling out smart meters to suppliers network operators customers and britain as a whole deccs impact assessment updated in january 2014 concludes that there is a positive business case overall of a smart meter rollout of £6.2 billion of net benefits 54 in may 2013 the government reviewed the programme timetable the government tested the time needed for the design build and test phases of industrys programmes the consistent message was that more time was needed if the roll-out of smart meters were to get off to the best possible start and if customers were to be sure of a quality service the government therefore now expects that the smart meter roll-outs will be completed by the end of 2020 55 consumer groups such as consumer focus  56 and the consumers association whichcitation needed have raised concerns about the extent to which consumer interests will be protected during the roll-out for example there has been concern that consumers may experience pressure selling while energy representatives are in their homes fitting meters 57 the government has now banned sales activities during meter installation visits  55 and put in place a number of consumer protection measures including ensuring that consumers will have choice and control over how their energy consumption data is used apart from where it is required for billing purposes 58 in march 2016 figures released by the department for energy and climate change 59 showed that only 2.3 million smart meters had been installed in uk homes this was well behind schedule to hit the governments target to have 50 million in place by 2020 the han is implemented using zigbee united statesedit californiaedit some areas of california have smart meters 60 although as of january 2012 there is a moratorium in santa cruz 61 the two main reasons are health and privacy on july 20 2006 californias energy regulators approved a program to roll out conventional meters retrofit with communications co-processor electronics to 9 million gas and electric household customers in the northern california territory of pacific gas and electric pge these meters report electricity consumption on an hourly basis this enables pge to set pricing that varies by season and time-of-the day rewarding customers who shift energy use to off-peak periods the peak pricing program will start out on a voluntary basis and the full rollout is expected to take five years 62 the smart grid currently allows pge to give customers timing and pricing options for upload to the grid the largest municipal utility in the us the los angeles department of water and power ladwp has chosen to expand its advanced metering infrastructure ami serving its commercial and industrial ci customers ladwp has already purchased 9,000 the utilities commercial and industrial customers may tailor their daily energy consumption around the data provided by the smart meters thus creating potential for reducing their monthly electricity bill and at a broader level contributing to global energy conservation marylandedit in spring 2012 baltimore gas and electric bge of maryland began installing or upgrading approximately two million electric and gas meters in every home and small business in their service

germanyedit on 8 july 2016 the new digitisation of the energy turnaround act cleared the final legislative hurdle in the german federal council bundesrat of germany the new law initiates the roll-out of smart meters and connected infrastructures in germany and defines roles and tasks for market participants the new act is based on the third energy package introduced by the eu in 2009 the directives of this package require eu member states to equip at least 80 of consumers with intelligent metering systems by 2020 subject to a positive national commercial assessment of the roll-out the key objective of the new law is to facilitate the implementation of smart meter and smart meter gateway devices in that respect germany implements the eu directives 2009/72eg and 2009/73eg into german law the act introduces specific and detailed requirements for the design of the smart meter devices and for the transmission of data the goal is to open up the energy market to digitalisation while ensuring a high standard of data protection and ict security the smart meters operation act messstellenbetriebsgesetz sets out in 77 sections rules on the marketing and use of smart meters and smart meter gateways the act introduced new regulated market roles particularly the role of the meter operator responsible the implementation operation and maintenance of smart meters with specific legal obligations in that role the responsibility connected with the roll out of the meter operator rests on the energy supply grid operator versorgungsnetzbetreiber using a special public procurement procedure they can transfer this position to a third party service provider another role is smart meter gateway administrator responsible for the correct allocation and security of the data collected and delivered by the smart meter gateway the act defines technical requirements particularly the reliability and security of energy measurement and the transmission of data compliance with the new rules is controlled and supervised by both the federal office for information security bundesamt für sicherheit in der informationstechnik and the federal network agency bundesnetzagentur the act determines a roll-out plan regarding the installation of smart meters the roll-out will begin in 2017 and continue until 2032 the process comprises different roll-out periods for different types of end consumers and plant operators depending on the amount of energy consumption that they use and respectively input feed in for some types of consumers and operators the roll-out must be completed before the end of 2024 the act requires operators to equip consumers with more than 6,000 kwh yearly consumption and plant operators with an installed capacity of more than 7kw with smart meters below these consumption levels equipment is optional manufacturers must supply the devices according to certification by the federal office for information security the federal office for information security provides an overview of its current technical requirements on its website irelandedit upon getting into the coalition government in 2007 eamon ryan the green party minister for communications energy and natural resources pledged to introduce smart meters for every home in the republic of ireland within a five-year period in an interview the minister said he envisages a situation where smart meters would use plug-in hybrid cars as storage for micro-generated renewable energy by intelligently diverting the energy into the car 78 a leading energy expert has expressed concerns that whatever system of smart metering arises in ireland must give homeowners the possibility of automatically responding to fluctuating electricity prices by for instance buying electricity when at its cheapest and selling micro-generated electricity from wind turbines or solar photovoltaic panels into the grid when the best price is available 79 italyedit as stated above italy has already deployed smart electrical meters legislation has recently been released forcing gas utilities to deploy smart gas meters from large industrial consumers down to almost every residential customer by the end of 2016 80 it is expected and desired that remote reading and management of smart gas meters will be fully independent of the existing system of smart electrical meters the technology intended to be used mainly will be radio-based more information can be found on the webpage published by the authority 81 iranedit in iran like many other developed countries smart grid implementation is regarded as a unique way for encountering many serious environmental and economic challenges that mankind is faced today faham is the national smart metering program in iran the functional technical security economic and general requirements of this project was published as a document after a longtime workgroup of various stakeholders including representative of grid operators meter manufactures communication providers business layer software providers domestic and international consultants the procedure of producing this document was base on epri methodology iec 62559 in these technical documents all of the business and functional use cases the conceptual architecture mandatory international standards for electric water and gas metering systemsfor all types of consumerstelecommunication requirements system interfaces and security mandates are defined the ministry of energy decided to perform a pilot project called faham-phase1 inorder to experiment the technical and executional challenges for implementing smart metering for all of the consumers about thirty million consumers maltaedit malta is in the process of implementing smart meters in all commercial and private households enemalta a governmental company responsible for electricity is responsible for the introduction of the smart meters this will occur in phases and it is projected that every meter in malta will be smart by 2012 this will cost approximately 40 million euros being paid by the ministry of infrastructure technology and communication the smart meters being used in malta are manufactured by ibm a pilot project is currently underway and more than 5,000 are being installed 82 the cost of the installation will be totally absorbed by the government ie the taxpayers technologyedit of all smart meter technologies one critical technological problem is communication each meter must be able to reliably and securely communicate the information collected to some central location considering the varying environments and locations where meters are found that problem can be daunting among the solutions proposed are the use of cell and pager networks satellite licensed radio combination licensed and unlicensed radio and power line communication not only the medium used for communication purposes but also the type of network used is critical as such one would find fixed wireless mesh network or a combination of the two there are several other potential network configurations possible including the use of wi-fi and other internet related networks to date no one solution seems to be optimal for all applications rural utilities have very different communication problems from urban utilities or utilities located in difficult locations such as mountainous regions or areas ill-served by wireless and internet companies in addition to communication with the head-end network smart meters may need to be part of a home area network which can include an in-premises display and a hub to interface one or more meters with the head end technologies for this network will vary from country to country but include power line communication and zigbee protocolsedit ansi c12.18 is an ansi standard that describes a protocol used for two-way communications with a meter mostly used in north american markets the c12.18 standard is written specifically for meter communications via an ansi type 2 optical port and specifies lower-level protocol details ansi c12.19 specifies the data tables that will be used ansi c12.21 is an extension of c12.18 written for modem instead of optical communications so it is better suited to automatic meter reading iec 61107 is a communication protocol for smart meters published by the iec that is widely used for utility meters in the european union it is superseded by iec 62056 but remains in wide use because it is simple and well-accepted it sends ascii data using a serial port the physical media are either modulated light sent with an led and received with a photodiode or a pair of wires usually modulated by eia-485 the protocol is half-duplex iec 61107 is related to and sometimes wrongly confused with the flag protocol ferranti and landisgyr were early proponents of an interface standard that eventually became a sub-set of iec1107 the open smart grid protocol osgp is a family of specifications published by the european telecommunications standards institute etsi used in conjunction with the isoiec 14908 control networking standard for smart metering and smart grid applications millions of smart meters based on osgp are deployed worldwide 83 numerous major security flaws in the osgp protocol have been identified 84 85 there is a growing trend toward the use of tcpip technology as a common communication platform for smart meter applications so that utilities can deploy multiple communication systems while using ip technology as a common management platform 86 87 a universal metering interface would allow for development and mass production of smart meters and smart grid devices prior to the communication standards being set and then for the relevant communication modules to be easily added or switched when they are this would lower the risk of investing in the wrong standard as well as permit a single product to be used globally even if regional communication standards vary 88 some smart meters may use a test ir led to transmit non-encrypted usage data that bypasses meter security by transmitting lower level data in real time  89 data managementedit the other critical technology for smart meter systems is the information technology at the utility that integrates the smart meter networks with the utility applications such as billing and cis this includes the meter data management system it also is important for smart grid implementations that power line communication plc technologies used within the home over a home area network han are standardized and compatible the han allows hvac systems and other household appliances to communicate with the smart meter and from there to the utility currently there are several broadband or narrowband standards in place or being developed that are not yet compatible in order to address this issue the national institute for standards and technology nist established the pap15 group which will study and recommend coexistence mechanisms with a focus on the harmonization of plc standards for the han the objective of the group is to ensure that all plc technologies selected for the han will coexist as a minimum the two main broadband plc technologies selected are the homeplug av  ieee 1901 and itu-t ghn technologies 90 technical working groups within these organizations are working to develop appropriate coexistence mechanisms the homeplug powerline alliance has developed a new standard for smart grid han communications called the homeplug green phy specification it is interoperable and coexistent with the widely deployed homeplug av technology and with the new ieee 1901 global standard and is based on broadband ofdm technology itu-t commissioned in 2010 a new project called ghnem to address the home networking aspects of energy management built upon existing low frequency narrowband ofdm technologies googleorgs powermeter until its demise in 2011 was able to use a smart meter for tracking electricity usage 91 as can emeters energy engage as in for example the powercentsdctm demand response programcitation needed google powermeter was retired in september 2011 92 securityedit implementing security protocols that will protect these devices from malicious attacks and new exploits has been a problematic task due to their limited computational resources and long operational life spans 93 the current version of iec 62056 includes the possibility to encrypt mac or sign the meter data one proposed smart meter data verification method involves analyzing the network traffic in real time to detect anomalies using an intrusion detection system ids by identifying exploits as they are being leveraged by attackers an intrusion detection system ids will mitigate the suppliers risks of energy theft by consumers and denial-of-service attacks by hackers 94 energy utilities will have to choose between a centralized ids embedded ids or dedicated ids depending on the individual needs of the utility researchers have found that for a typical advanced metering infrastructure the centralized ids architecture is superior in terms of cost efficiency and security gains 93 in the united kingdom the data communication company which transports the commands from the supplier to the smart meter performs an additional anomality check on commands issued and signed by the energy supplier advanced metering infrastructureedit advanced metering infrastructure ami are systems that measure collect and analyze energy usage and communicate with metering devices such as electricity meters gas meters heat meters and water meters either on request or on a schedule these systems include hardware software communications consumer energy displays and controllers customer associated systems meter data management mdm software and supplier business systems government agencies and utilities are turning toward advanced metering infrastructure ami systems as part of larger smart grid initiatives ami extends current advanced meter reading amr technology by providing two way meter communications allowing commands to be sent toward the home for multiple purposes including time-of-use pricing information demand-response actions or remote service disconnects wireless technologies are critical elements of the neighborhood area network nan aggregating a mesh configuration of up to thousands of meters for back haul to the utilitys it headquarters the network between the measurement devices and business systems allows collection and distribution of information to customers suppliers utility companies and service providers this enables these businesses to participate in demand response services consumers can use information provided by the system to change their normal consumption patterns to take advantage of lower prices pricing can be used to curb growth of peak consumption ami differs from traditional automatic meter reading amr in that it enables two-way communications with the meter systems only capable of meter readings do not qualify as ami systems 95 opposition and concernsedit some groups have expressed concerns regarding the cost health fire risk 35 security and privacy effects of smart meters and the remote controllable kill switch that is included with most of them many of these concerns regard wireless-only smart meters with no home energy monitoring or control or safety features metering-only solutions while popular with utilities because they fit existing business models and have cheap up-front capital costs often result in such backlash often the entire smart grid and smart building concept is discredited in part by confusion about the difference between home control and home area network technology and ami the attorneys general of both illinois and connecticut have stated that they do not believe smart meters provide any financial benefit to consumers 96 however the cost of the installation of the new system will be absorbed by those customers health and safetyedit most health concerns about the meters arise from the pulsed radiofrequency rf radiation emitted by wireless smart meters 97 members of the california state assembly asked the california council on science and technology ccst to study the issue of potential health impacts from smart meters the ccst report in april 2011 found no health impacts based both on lack of scientific evidence of harmful effects from radio frequency rf waves and that the rf exposure of people in their homes to smart meters is likely to be minuscule compared to rf exposure to cell phones and microwave ovens 98 issues surrounding smart meters causing fires have also been reported particularly involving the manufacturer sensus in 2012 peco energy company replaced the sensus meters it had deployed in the philadelphia region after reports that a number of the units had overheated and caused fires in july 2014 saskpower the province-run utility company of the canadian province of saskatchewan halted its roll-out of sensus meters after similar isolated incidents were discovered shortly afterward portland general electric announced that it would replace 70,000 smart meters that had been deployed in the state of oregon after similar reports the company noted that it had been aware of the issues since at least 2013 and that they were limited to certain models it had installed between 2010 and 2012 99 on july 30 2014 after a total of 8 recent incidents involving the meters saskpower was ordered by the government of saskatchewan to immediately end its smart meter program and remove the 105,000 smart meters it had installed 100 privacy concernsedit one technical reason for privacy concerns is that these meters send detailed information about how much electricity is being used each time more frequent reports provide more detailed information infrequent reports may be of little benefit for the provider as it doesnt allow as good demand management in the response of changing needs for electricity on the other hand very frequent reports would allow the utility company to infer behavioral patterns for the occupants of a house such as when the members of the household are probably asleep or absent current trends are to increase the frequency of reports a solution which benefits both the provider and the users privacy would be to adapt the interval dynamically 101 another solution involves an energy storage installed at the household used to reshape the energy consumption profile 102 103 in bc canada the electric utility is government owned and as such must comply with privacy laws that prevent the sale of data collected by smart meters many parts of the world are serviced by private companies that are able to sell their data 104 in australia debt collectors can make use of the data to know when people are at home 105 used as evidence in a court case in austin texas police agencies secretly collected smart meter power usage data from thousands of residences to determine which ones were using more power than typical in order to find targets to pursue in marijuana growing operations 106 smart meter power data usage patterns can reveal much more than how much power is being used research has been done which has demonstrated that smart meters sampling power levels at two-second intervals can reliably identify when different electrical devices are in use and even what channel or program is being viewed on a television based on the electrical consumption patterns of these devices and the electrical noises that they emit 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 opt-out optionsedit reviews of smart meter programs moratoriums delays and opt-out programs are some responses to the concerns of customers and government officials in response to residents who did not want a smart meter in june 2012 a utility in hawaii changed their smart meter program to opt out 115 the utility said that once the smart grid installation project is nearing completion kiuc may convert the deferral policy to an opt-out policy or program and may charge a fee to those members to cover the costs of servicing the traditional meters any fee would require approval from the hawaii public utilities commission after receiving numerous complaints about health hacking and privacy concerns with the wireless digital devices the public utility commission of the us state of maine voted to allow customers to opt out of the meter change at a cost of $12 a month 116 in connecticut another us state to consider smart metering recently regulators declined a request by the states largest utility connecticut light  power to install 1.2 million of the devices arguing that the potential savings in electric bills do not justify the cost clp already offers its customers time-based rates the states attorney general george jepsen was quoted as saying the proposal would cause customers to spend upwards of $500 million on meters and get few benefits in return a claim that connecticut light  power disputed 117 lack of savings in resultsedit there are questions whether electricity is or should be primarily a when you need it service where the inconveniencecost-benefit ratio of time shifting of loads is poor in the chicago area commonwealth edison ran a test installing smart meters on 8,000 randomly selected households together with variable rates and rebates to encourage cutting back during peak usage 118 in the crains chicago business article smart grid test underwhelms in pilot few power down to save money it was reported that fewer than 9 exhibited any amount of peak usage reduction and that the overall amount of reduction was statistically insignificant 118 this was from a report by the electric power research institute a utility industry think tank who conducted the study and prepared the report susan satter senior assistant illinois attorney general for public utilities said its devastating to their planthe report shows zero statistically different result compared to business as usual  118 by 2016 the 7 million smart meters in texas had failed to produce results 119 in the mediaedit in 2013 take back your power an independent canadian documentary directed by josh del sol was released describing dirty electricity and the aforementioned issues with smart meters 120 the film explores the various contexts of the health legal and economic concerns and features narration from mayor of peterborough ontario daryl bennett as well as american researcher
