nevada solar one nevada solar one is a concentrated solar power plant with a nominal capacity of 64mw and maximum steam turbine power output up to 72mw net  75mw gross spread over an area of 400 acres  160ha the projected co2 emissions avoided is equivalent to taking approximately 20,000 cars off the road annually the project required an investment of $266 million usd 1 and the project officially went to operation in june 2007 2 electricity production is estimated to be 134 million kilowatt hours per year 3 it is the second solar thermal energy ste power plant built in the united states in more than 16 years 4 and the largest ste plant built in the world since 1991 5 it is located in eldorado valley in the southwest fringe of boulder city nevada and was built in that citys energy resource zone which requires renewable generation as part of plant development permits nevada solar one was approved as part of duke energys larger el dorado energy project that built 1 gw of electrical generation capacity the solar trough generation was built by acciona solar power a partially owned subsidiary of spanish conglomerate acciona energy 6 lauren engineers  constructors abilene tx was the epc contractor for the project 7 acciona purchased a 55 percent stake in solargenix formerly duke solar and acciona owns 95 percent of the project 8 nevada solar one is unrelated to the

tucson arizona public services saguaro solar facility opened with 1 mwof electrical generation capacity 9 nevada solar one went online for commercial use on june 27 2007 it uses similar technology and was constructed over a period of 16 months the total project site is approximately 400 acres  0.6mi  1.6km while the solar collectors cover 300 acres  1.2km2 technologyedit nevada solar one uses proprietary technology to track the suns location and concentrate its rays during peak demand hours the plant uses 760 parabolic trough concentrators with more than 182,000 mirrors that concentrate the suns rays onto more than 18,240 receiver tubes placed at the focal axis of the troughs and containing a heat transfer fluid solar receivers fluid that heats up to 735f  391c flows through these tubes and is used to produce steam that drives a siemens sst-700 10 steam turbine adapted to the specific requirements of the csp technology 11 which is connected to a generator to produce electricity the mirrors are manufactured by flabeg ag in germany 12 in contrast to the power tower concentrator concept that californias original solar one project uses the specially coated tubes made of glass and steel were designed and produced by solel solar systems 13 as well as by schott glass in germany 14 motion control was supplied by parker hannifin from components by ansco machine company solar thermal power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands such as the southwestern united states using thermal energy storage systems solar thermal operating periods can be extended to meet base load needs 15 given nevadas land and sun resources the state has the theoretical ability to have more than 600gw of electrical generation capacity using solar thermal concentrators like those used by nevada solar one 16 it has been proposed that massive expansion of solar plants such as nevada solar one has the potential to provide sufficient electricity to power the entire united states 17 parabolic concentrator facilities have been successfully operating in californias mojave desert commercially since 1984 with a combined generating capacity of 354mw from the solar energy generating systems about 30 parabolic trough power plants are operating in spain see solar power in spain and more are in construction or proposed and two 110mw plants in israel 18 19 productionedit nevada solar ones production is as follows values in gwh 20 fossil backup is provided by natural gas and provides up to 2
