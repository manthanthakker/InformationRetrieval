gathered at columbia university for that purpose they proclaimed the mission of the new society to be to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics and in one way or another the aps has been at that task ever since in the early years virtually the sole activity of the aps was to hold scientific meetings initially four per year in 1913 the aps took over the operation of the physical review which had been founded in 1893 at cornell university and journal publication became its second major activity the physical review was followed by reviews of modern physics in 1929 and by physical review letters in 1958 over the years phys rev has subdivided into five separate sections as the fields of physics proliferated and the number of submissions grew in more recent years the activities of the society have broadened considerably stimulated by the increase in federal funding in the period after the second world war and even more by the increased public involvement of scientists in the 1960s the aps is active in public and governmental affairs and in the international physics community in addition the society conducts extensive programs in education science outreach specifically physics outreach and media relations aps has 14 divisions and 11 topical groups covering all areas of physics research there are 6 forums that reflect the interest of its 50,000 members 2 in broader issues and 9 sections organized by geographical region in 1999 aps physics celebrated its centennial with the biggest-ever physics meeting in atlanta in 2005 aps took the lead role in united states participation in the world year of physics initiating several programs to broadly publicize physics during the 100th anniversary of albert einsteins annus mirabilis einsteinhome one of the projects aps initiated during world year of physics is an ongoing and popular distributed computing project name change proposaledit during the summer of 2005 the society conducted an electronic poll in which the majority of aps members preferred the name american physics society the poll became the motivation for a proposal of a name change promised in the leadership election that year however because of legal issues the planned name change was eventually abandoned by the aps executive board 3 to promote public recognition of aps as a physics society while retaining the name american physical society the aps executive board adopted a new logo incorporating the phrase aps physics general use of aps physics to refer to aps or the american physical society is encouraged the new aps physics logo was designed by kerry g johnson marvin cohen lbnl faculty senior scientist university professor of physics university of california berkeley who was aps president in november 2005 when the logo was approved by the executive board said i like the logo at least now when you are in an elevator at an aps meeting and someone looks at your badge they wont ask you about sports 4 aps journalsedit the

of their careers such as the davisson-germer prize in atomic or surface physics rabi prize in amo physics outstanding doctoral thesis research in amo physics herbert p broida prize etc it also organizes annual damop meetings attended by many leading amo researchers both from the united states and abroad astrophysics dap biological physics dbiowith over 2,000 members 8 the division is the second largest learned society in the world devoted to biological physics following the biophysical society the objective of the division is the advancement and dissemination of knowledge on the broad interface of physics and biology this includes studying biological phenomena with physics tools and identifying new physics questions within biological contexts the division supports a program of over 500 presentations at the annual march meeting of the aps on topics ranging from protein biophysics to neuroscience and evolution it promotes research and development of biological physics enhanced the standing of the field and recognizes important contributions to the field such as by awarding the max delbruck prize in biological physics 9 chemical physics dcp computational physics dcomp the division has more than 2,000 members and the objective of the division is the advancement and dissemination of knowledge regarding the use of computers in physics research and education this includes among other areas their application to experiments theory and education as well as the application of physics to the development of computer technology this division provides to its members an opportunity for coordination and a forum for discussion and communication in addition the division promotes research and development in computational physics enhances prestige and professional standing of its members encourages scholarly publication and promotes international cooperation in these activities 10 condensed matter physics dcmp fluid dynamics dfd laser science dls materials
