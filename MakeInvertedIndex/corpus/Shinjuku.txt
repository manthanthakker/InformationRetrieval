present-day shinjuku the neighbourhood not the municipality parts of nishi-shinjuku and kabukichō was integrated into tokyo city shinjuku began to develop into its current form after the great kantō earthquake in 1923 since the seismically stable area largely escaped the devastation consequently west shinjuku is one of the few areas in tokyo with many skyscrapers the tokyo air raids from may to august 1945 destroyed almost 90 of the buildings in the area in and around shinjuku station 6 the pre-war form of shinjuku and the rest of tokyo for that matter was retained after the war because the roads and rails damaged as they were remained and these formed the heart of the shinjuku in the post-war construction only in kabuki-cho was a grand reconstruction plan put into action 7 the present
