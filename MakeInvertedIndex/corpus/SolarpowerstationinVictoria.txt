mildura solar concentrator power station the mildura solar concentrator power station is a proposed 100megawatt mw concentrated photovoltaic cpv solar pv system to be built at carwarp near mildura victoria australia 1 it was proposed by solar systems 2 which was acquired by silex systems in 2010 a 1.5mw demonstration plant was commissioned in april 2013 construction of the larger facility was expected to commence in 2014 and be completed in 2017 3 4 the expansion plan was abandoned in august 2014 due to a number of factors these included low wholesale electricity prices a lack of commitment to clean energy by the australian government and uncertainty surrounding the renewable energy target ret in australia 5 6  contents 1 history 2 technology 3 previous projects 4 see also 5 references  historyedit the project to build a 154mw solar plant was announced in 2006 and expected to be completed in 2013 7 8 it was delayed after solar systems went into administration as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis 4 the demonstration plant was completed in 2013 technologyedit the cs500 dish concentrator pv unit design has 112 curved reflecting mirrors which track the sun throughout the day the combination of mirror profile mounting framework and solar receiver will deliver concentrated solar energy to each pv module the tracking mechanism allows electricity to be produced during the day whenever the sun is more than 5 above the horizon direct current electricity from the receivers is passed through a solar inverter that produces grid-quality alternating current transformers step up the voltage to the requirement of the local network at the point of connection advantages claimed for this design include 9 the cs500 dish has a longer effective operating life than conventional photovoltaic arrays because the receiver is only a small area of pv a 35kw cs500 dish has a pv area of 0.23m whereas 35kw of traditional flat plate would use approximately 350m maintenance is simple quick and affordable the modules include a specially designed filter that removes harmful uv radiation that reduces the operating efficiency and life of traditional pv technology the modules are also cooled which increases their effective operating life and their efficiency the cs500 dish costs significantly less per installed watt than traditional pv technology this is despite the fact that the cs500 is new and still near the top of its cost curve advances in technology maturity and volume production will further increase the gap the cs500 produces more electricity per installed watt than fixed flatplate pv technology - by up to 30 this is because it tracks the sun and operates at lower temperatures 10 previous projectsedit the commercialisation of this technology has already seen four smaller solar power stations established in central australia with support from the australian greenhouse office 11 see alsoedit renewable energy portal australia portal solar power in australia energy policy of australia referencesedit v t e hazelwood loy yang yallourn bairnsdale jeeralang laverton north longford mortlake somerton newport valley power banimboola blue rock dartmouth eildon eildon pondage mckay creek kiewa scheme rubicon scheme william hovell yarrawonga weir challicum hills macarthur mount mercer portland waubra list of wind farms proposed mildura bendigo shepparton symex cogeneration project victoria harbour cogeneration project portland geothermal facility citipower powercor australia ausnet services jemena united energy agl energy alinta energy australian power and gas click energy country energy dodo power  gas energyaustralia lumo energy momentum energy neighbourhood energy origin energy powerdirect powershop red energy simply energy pacific hydro solar systems essential services commission australian energy market operator australian energy market commission australian energy regulator decommissioned power stations defunct utility companies state electricity commission gas and fuel corporation victorian power exchange nemmco vencorp
