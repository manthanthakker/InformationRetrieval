power-to-x power-to-x also p2x and p2y 1 has two meanings first power-to-x refers to a number of electricity conversion energy storage and reconversion pathways that utilize surplus electric power typically during periods where fluctuating renewable energy generation exceeds load 2 second power-to-x refers to conversion technologies that allow for the decoupling of power from the electricity sector for use in other sectors such as transport or chemicals possibly using power that has been provided by additional investments in generation 2 the term power-to-x is widely used in germany and may have originated there the x in the terminology can refer to one of the following power-to-ammonia power-to-chemicals power-to-fuel power-to-gas power-to-heat power-to-hydrogen power-to-liquid power-to-methane power-to-mobility power-to-power and power-to-syngas collectively power-to-x schemes which use surplus power fall under the heading of flexibility measures and are particularly useful in energy systems with high shares of renewable generation andor with strong decarbonization targets 1 2 a large number of pathways and technologies are encompassed by the term in 2016 the german government funded a â‚¬30million first-phase research project into power-to-x options 3  contents 1 electricity storage concepts 2 sector coupling concepts 3 see also 4 references  electricity storage conceptsedit surplus electric power can be converted to other forms of energy for storage and reconversion 4 5 6 7 direct current electrolysis can be used to produce hydrogen which can in turn be converted to methane ch4 via methanation these fuels can be stored and used to produce electricity again hours to months later reconversion technologies include gas turbines ccgt plant and fuel cells power-to-power refers to the round-trip reconversion efficiency 4 electrolysis is expensive and power-to-gas processes need substantial full-load hours say 30 to be economic 2 grid-dedicated battery storage is not normally considered a power-to-x concept sector coupling conceptsedit hydrogen and methane can also be used as downstream fuels feed into the natural gas grid or used to make or synthetic fuel 8 9 alternatively they can be used as a chemical feedstock as can ammonia nh3 power-to-heat involves contributing to the heat sector either by resistance heating or via a heat pump back-up immersion heating of both domestic hot water and district heating offers a cheap way of using surplus renewable energy and will often displace carbon-intensive fossil fuels for the task 2 power-to-mobility refers to the charging of battery electric vehicles ev given the expected uptake of evs dedicated dispatch will be required see alsoedit energy storage grid energy storage power-to-gas referencesedit  v t e smart grid smart meter nonintrusive load monitoring demand response demand management dynamic demand negawatts hvdc bulk transmission facts power line communication phasor measurement unit load following load control peak demand power-to-x renewable energy policy feed-in tariff net metering renewable energy certificates renewable energy payments soft energy path carbon capture and storage energy security climate change united states energy independence peak oil energy crisis renewable energy commercialization rural electrification v t e availability factor base load black start capacity factor demand factor demand management eroei fault grid storage intermittency load factor load following nameplate capacity peak demand power quality power-flow study repowering variability coal fossil-fuel power station natural gas petroleum nuclear oil shale biomass biofuel geothermal hydro marine current osmotic thermal tidal wave solar wind current osmotic thermal tidal wave ac power cogeneration combined cycle cooling tower induction generator micro chp microgeneration rankine cycle three-phase electric power virtual power plant blackout rolling blackout brownout demand response distributed generation dynamic demand electric power distribution electric power system electric power transmission electrical grid high-voltage direct current load management pumped hydro power station power storage smart grid substation super grid transformer transmission system operator tso transmission tower utility pole arc-faultcircuitinterrupter earth leakage circuit breaker residual-current device gfi power-system protection protective relay digital protective relay sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker carbon offset cost of electricity by source ecotax energy subsidies feed-in tariff fossil-fuel phase-out net metering pigovian tax renewable energy certificates renewable energy payments renewable energy policy spark spread
