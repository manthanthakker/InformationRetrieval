energy star energy star trademarked energy star is an international standard for energy efficient consumer products originated in the united states it was created in 1992 by the environmental protection agency and the department of energy 3 4 since then australia canada japan new zealand taiwan and the european union have adopted the program devices carrying the energy star service mark such as computer products and peripherals kitchen appliances buildings and other products generally use 20â€“30 less energy than required by federal standards 5 in the united states the energy star

it industry and implemented by cathy zoi and brian johnson 6 the program was intended to be part of a series of voluntary programs such as green lights and the methane programs that would demonstrate the potential for profit in reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gases by power plants 6 initiated as a voluntary labeling program designed to identify and promote energy efficient products energy star began with labels for computer and printer products in 1995 the program was significantly expanded introducing labels for residential heating and cooling systems and new homes 7 at this time newly formed energy efficiency programs administered by ratepayer funded entities such as utilities agreed through the consortium for energy efficiency to begin promoting their programs using the energy star brand in 2000 the consortium for energy efficiency was directed by members to begin an annual survey of energy star impact 8 as of 2006 more than 40,000 energy star products were available in a wide range of items including major appliances office equipment lighting home electronics and more in addition the label can also be found on new homes and commercial and industrial buildings in 2006 about 12 percent of new housing in the united states was labeled energy star 9 the epa estimates that it saved about $14 billion in energy costs in 2006 alone the energy star program has helped spread the use of led traffic lights efficient fluorescent lighting power management systems for office equipment and low standby energy use 10 in 2008 the epa announced the green power partnership program which was designed to help achieve its goal of encouraging the use of renewable power sources the renewable energy credits rec allow companies without direct access to renewable power the ability to achieve their goals however to avoid companies buying recs years in advance of any of the hypothetical power ever being produced recs are only accepted into the program when the actual equivalent renewable power will be produced 11 specificationsedit energy star specifications differ with each item and are set by either the environmental protection agency or the department of energy the following highlights product and specification information available on the energy star website computersedit energy star 4.0 specifications for computers became effective on july 20 2007 the requirements are more stringent than the previous specification and existing equipment designs can no longer use the service mark unless re-qualified they require the use of 80 plus bronze level or higher power supplies energy star 5.0 became effective on july 1 2009 12 13 serversedit the epa released version 1.0 of the computer server specifications on may 15 2009 it covers standalone servers with one to four processor sockets a second tier to the specification adding active state power and performance reporting for all qualified servers as well as blade and multi-node server idle state requirements is expected in 2013 14 appliancesedit as of early 2008 average refrigerators need 20 savings over the minimum standard dishwashers need at least 41 savings most appliances as well as heating and cooling systems have a yellow energyguide label showing the annual cost of operation compared to other models this label is created through the federal trade commission and often shows if an appliance is energy star 15 while an energy star label indicates that the appliance is more energy efficient than the minimum guidelines purchasing an energy star labeled product does not always mean one is getting the most energy efficient option available for example dehumidifiers that are rated under 25 us pints  12l per day of water extraction receive an energy star rating if they have an energy factor of 1.2 higher is better while those rated 25 us pints  12l to 35 us pints  17l per day receive an energy star rating for an energy factor of 1.4 or higher thus a higher-capacity but non-energy star rated dehumidifier may be a more energy efficient alternative than an energy star rated but lower-capacity model 16 the energy star programs savings calculator has also been criticized for unrealistic assumptions in its model that tend to magnify savings benefits to the average consumer 17 another factor yet to be considered by the epa and doe is the overall effect of energy-saving requirements on the durability and expected service life of a mass-market appliance built to a consumer-level cost standard for example a refrigerator may be made more efficient by the use of more insulative spacing and a smaller-capacity compressor using electronics to control operation and temperature however this may come at the cost of reduced interior storage or increased exterior mass or a reduced service life due to compressor or electronic failures in particular electronic controls used on new-generation appliances are subject to damage from shock vibration moisture or power spikes on the electrical circuit to which they are attached critics have pointed out that even if a new appliance is energy efficient any consumer appliance that does not provide customer satisfaction or must be replaced twice as often as its predecessor contributes to landfill pollution and waste of natural resources used to construct its replacement 18 heating and cooling systemsedit energy star qualified heat pumps boilers air conditioning systems and furnaces are available in addition cooling and heating bills can be significantly lowered with air sealing and duct sealing air sealing reduces the outdoor air that penetrates a building and duct sealing prevents attic or basement air from entering ducts and lessening the heatingcooling systems efficiency energy star qualified room air conditioners are at least 10 more energy efficient than the minimum us federal government standards 19 home electronicsedit energy star qualified televisions 20 use 30 less energy than average in november 2008 television specifications were improved to limit on-mode power use in addition to standby power which is limited by the current specifications a wider range of energy star qualified televisions will be available other qualified home electronics include cordless phones battery chargers vcrs and external power adapters most of which use 90 less energy imaging equipmentedit the energy star program requirements for imaging products are focused on product families such as electrophotographic ep printers inkjet printers eg thermal copiers facsimile machines and other imaging equipment including mfds multifunctional devices typical electrical consumption tec of a product family are measured and reported against an allowance set by the maximum throughput of the device operation modes om are measured and reported for devices such as inkjet products against an allowance set by the functions present in the eut equipment under test devices that included adders such as ethernet on-board memory wireless etc are mathematically added to increase the om allowance recently on february 1 2011 the epadoe added the requirement that all products registered under the energy star service mark must be tested by an ab accredited body or cb certification body laboratory lightingedit the energy star is awarded to only certain bulbs that meet strict efficiency quality and lifetime criteria energy star qualified fluorescent lighting uses 75 less energy and lasts up to ten times longer than normal incandescent lights energy star qualified light-emitting diode led lighting reduces energy costs uses at least 75 less energy than incandescent lighting saving on operating expenses reduces maintenance costs lasts 35 to 50 times longer than incandescent lighting and about 2 to 5 times longer than fluorescent lighting no bulb-replacements no ladders no ongoing disposal program reduces cooling costs leds produce very little heat to qualify for energy star certification led lighting products must pass a variety of tests to prove that the products will display the following characteristics brightness is equal to or greater than existing lighting technologies incandescent or fluorescent and light is well distributed over the area lighted by the fixture light output remains constant over time only decreasing towards the end of the rated lifetime at least 35,000 hours or 12 years based on use of 8 hours per day excellent color quality the shade of white light appears clear and consistent over time efficiency is as good as or better than fluorescent lighting light comes on instantly when turned on no flicker when dimmed no off-state power draw the fixture does not use power when it is turned off with the exception of external controls whose power should not exceed 0.5 watts in the off state new homesedit new homes that meet strict guidelines for energy efficiency can qualify for energy star certification an energy star qualified home uses at least 15 less energy than standard homes built to the 2003 international residential code irc they usually include properly installed insulation high performance windows tight construction and ducts energy efficient cooling and heating systems and energy star qualified appliances lighting and water heaters 21 energy performance ratingsedit the us epas energy star program has developed energy performance rating systems for several commercial and institutional building types and manufacturing facilities these ratings on a scale of 1 to 100 provide a means for benchmarking the energy efficiency of specific buildings and industrial plants against the energy performance of similar facilities the ratings are used by building and energy managers to evaluate the energy performance of existing buildings and industrial plants the rating systems are also used by epa to determine if a building or plant can qualify to earn energy star recognition 22 23 for many types of commercial buildings one can enter energy information into epas free online tool portfolio manager 24 and it will calculate a score for ones building on a scale of 1-100 buildings that score a 75 or greater may qualify for the energy star portfolio manager is an interactive energy management tool that allows one to track and assess energy and water consumption across ones entire portfolio of buildings in a secure online environment whether one owns manages or holds properties for investment portfolio manager can help one set investment priorities identify under-performing buildings verify efficiency improvements and receive epa recognition for superior energy performance 25 portfolio manager uses an automated benchmarking tool that can award energy star certification to buildings that have uploaded 12 months of consecutive energy usage data and received scores of 75 or above buildingsedit the number of space types that can receive the energy performance rating in portfolio manager is expanding and now includes housing 9 bankfinancial institutions courthouses hospitals acute care and childrens hotels and motels houses of worship k-12 schools medical offices offices residence hallsdormitories retail stores supermarkets warehouses refrigerated and non-refrigerated data centers senior care facilities and wastewater facilities 26 27 see the technical descriptions for models used in the rating system at 28 these documents provide detailed information on the methodologies used to create the energy performance ratings including details on rating objectives regression techniques and the steps applied to compute a rating a 1-100 rating can be generated for ratable space types by entering building attributes such as square footage and weekly operating hours and monthly energy consumption data into portfolio manager a free online tool provided by energy star this process is known as benchmarking and reveals how a buildings energy consumption compares to that of other similar buildings of the same space type based on a national average earning a rating of 75 or above is the first step towards achieving the energy star for a building energy star energy performance ratings have been incorporated into some green buildings standards such as leed for existing buildings energy conservation building code - india industrial facilitiesedit energy performance ratings have been released for the following industrial facilities 29 automobile assembly plants cement plants wet corn mills container glass manufacturing flat glass manufacturing frozen fried potato processing plants juice processing petroleum refineries and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants 27 other facilitiesedit small business awardedit the us environmental protection agency epa annually recognizes small businesses that demonstrate abilities to reduce waste conserve energy and recycle the businesses use resources and ideas outlined in the energy star program 30 the award was established in 1999 controversiesedit on december 17 2008 the epa office of the inspector general released its report on the energy star program the inspector generals audit found that the programs claims regarding greenhouse gas reductions were inaccurate and based on faulty data additionally the ig found that energy star programs reported energy savings were unreliable and that many of the touted benefits could not be verified deficiencies included the lack of a quality review of the data collected reliance on estimates forecasting and unverified third party reporting and the potential inclusion of exported items the report concluded 31 additionally the american council for an energy-efficient economy consumer reports and the trade website applianceadvisorcom 32 have released statements claiming that energy star test procedures contained loopholes that allow many inefficient products to receive energy star labels specific claims include us department of energy regulations allowed the manufacturers to test the refrigerators with their ice-makers turned off which is not how they are normally used in the home however the energy star requirements usually exclude refrigerators that include an ice maker because of the penetration of the ice dispenser some designs get around this by dispensing the ice into a tray located in the freezer 33 using outdated testing rules and loose standards to award energy star ratings the program allows manufacturers to test their own products and only selectively spot-checks the test results they submit there are so many individually rated refrigerator categories that even inefficient product categories such as side-by-sides are certified before the complaints were raised in 2008 2006 federal court had required the doe to update and tighten misleading energy star ratings given to products in almost two dozen categories including dishwashers air conditioners heaters furnaces and clothes dryers the updates were to settle complaints by 14 states however categories such as room air conditioners and clothes dryers would not be completed until june 2011 34 the us environmental protection agency had released reports in 2007 and 2008 claiming energy star labels were misleading inspector general issued a report that said energy stars savings claims were not accurate or verifiable the report also found that shipment data for energy star products were not being adequately reviewed and in some cases were based on estimates instead of actual shipping totals 35 martin hellman revealed that energy star standby mode requirement can be compromised when an electronic device uses download acquisition mode dam feature to update tv guide listing during standby mode hellman first found the feature on sony kdl-37xbr6 36 in march 2010 a report by the government accountability office stated that the energy star program had accepted 15 out of 20 bogus products submitted for approval the energy star program had also qualified four businesses as energy star partners failing to catch the fact that information on the companies products and staff were all fictitious 37 in 2011 epa has tried to remedy this problem by requiring third-party verification of all products epa now requires products destined for the us market to be tested for qualification in an epa-recognized laboratory and certified as meeting the energy star requirements by a third-party certification program  38 adoption in building codesedit the current and projected status of energy
