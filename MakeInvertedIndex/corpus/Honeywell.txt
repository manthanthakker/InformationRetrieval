honeywells heating specialty company wouldnt be founded until 1906 todays honeywell traces its roots back to 1885 when the swiss-born albert butz invented the damper-flapper a thermostat for coal furnaces to automatically regulate heating systems 8 the following year he founded the butz thermo-electric regulator company in 1888 after a falling out with his investors butz left the company and transferred the patents to the legal firm paul sanford and merwin who renamed the company the consolidated temperature controlling company 8 as the years passed ctcc struggled with growing debts and they underwent several name changes in an attempt to keep the business afloat after the company was renamed to the electric heat regulator company in 1893 wr sweatt a stockholder in the company was sold an extensive list of patents and named secretary-treasurer 9:22 on february 23 1898 he bought out the remaining shares of the company from the other stockholders in 1906 mark honeywell founded the honeywell heating specialty company in wabash indiana to manufacture and market his invention the mercury seal generator as honeywells company grew thanks in part to the acquisition of jewell manufacturing company in 1922 to better automate his heating system it began to clash with the renamed minneapolis heat regulator company this led to the merging of the two companies into the publicly held minneapolis-honeywell regulator company in 1927 honeywell named its first president wr sweatt as its first chairman 10 international expansion and acquisition 1927–1985edit wr sweatt and his son harold provided 75 years of uninterrupted leadership for the company wr sweatt survived rough spots and turned an innovative idea  thermostatic heating control  into a thriving business harold who took over in 1934 led honeywell through a period of growth and global expansion that set the stage for honeywell to become a global technology leader the merger into the minneapolis-honeywell regulator company proved to be a saving grace for the corporation the combined assets were valued at over $3.5 million with less than $1 million in liabilities just months before black monday 9:49 in 1931 minneapolis-honeywell began a period of expansion and acquisition when they purchased time-o-stat controls company giving the company access to a greater number of patents to be used in their controls systems 1934 marked minneapolis-honeywells first foray into the international market when they acquired the brown instrument company and inherited their relationship with the yamatake company of tokyo a japan-based distributor 9:51 later that same year minneapolis-honeywell would also start distributorships across canada as well as one in the netherlands their first european office this expansion into international markets continued in 1936 with their first distributorship in london as well as their first foreign assembly facility being established in canada by 1937 ten years after the merger minneapolis-honeywell had over 3,000 employees with $16 million in annual revenue 8 having survived the depression minneapolis-honeywell was approached by the us military for engineering and manufacturing projects in 1941 minneapolis-honeywell developed a superior tank periscope and camera stabilizers as well as the c-1 autopilot the c-1 revolutionized precision bombing in the war effort and was used on the two b-29 bombers that dropped atomic bombs on japan in 1945 the success of these projects led minneapolis-honeywell to open an aero division in chicago on october 5 1942 9:73 this division was responsible for the development of the formation stick to control autopilots more accurate gas gauges for planes and the turbo supercharger 9:79 in 1950 minneapolis-honeywells aero division was contracted for the controls on the first us nuclear submarine uss nautilus 9:88 the following year the company acquired intervox company for their sonar ultrasonics and telemetry technologies honeywell also helped develop and manufacture the rur-5 asroc for the us navy in 1953 in cooperation with the usaf wright-air development center honeywell developed an automated control unit that could control an aircraft through various stages of a flight from taxiing to takeoff to the point where the aircraft neared its destination and the pilot took over for landing called the automatic master sequence selector the onboard control operated similarly to a player piano to relay instructions to the aircrafts autopilot at certain way points during the flight significantly reducing the pilots workload 11 technologically this effort had parallels to contemporary efforts in missile guidance and numerical control honeywell also developed the wagtail missile with the usaf from the 1950s until the mid-1970s honeywell was the united states importer of pentax cameras and photographic equipment 9:153 these products were labeled honeywell pentax in the us in 1953 honeywell introduced their most famous product the t-86 round thermostat 8 9:110 on april 12 1955 minneapolis-honeywell started a joint venture with raytheon called datamatic to enter the computer market and compete with ibm 9:118 two years later in 1957 their first computer the d-1000 was sold and installed in 1960 just five years after embarking on this venture with raytheon minneapolis-honeywell bought out raytheons interest in datamatic and turned it into the electronic data processing division now honeywell information systems of minneapolis-honeywell 9:118 honeywell also purchased minicomputer pioneer computer control corporation  3cs renaming it as honeywells computer control division through most of the 1960s honeywell was one of the snow white and the seven dwarfs of computing ibm was snow white while the dwarfs were the seven significantly smaller computer companies burroughs control data corporation general electric honeywell ncr rca and univac later when their number had been reduced to five 12 they were known as the bunch after their initials burroughs univac ncr control data corporation and honeywell in 1961 james h binger became honeywells president and in 1965 its chairman on becoming chairman of honeywell binger revamped the company sales approach placing emphasis on profits rather than on volume he also stepped up the companys international expansion  it had six plants producing 12 of the companys revenue he also officially changed the companys corporate name from minneapolis-honeywell regulator co to honeywell to better represent their colloquial name throughout the 1960s honeywell continued to acquire other businesses including security burglar alarm company in 1969 9:130 the beginning of the 1970s saw honeywell focus on process controls with the company merging their computer operations with ges information systems in 1970 and later acquiring ges process control business 9:122 with the acquisition honeywell took over responsibility for ges ongoing multics operating system project the design and features of multics greatly influenced the unix operating system multics also influenced many of the features of honeywellges gecos and gcos8 general comprehensive operating system operating systems honeywell groupe bull and control data corporation formed a joint venture in magnetic peripherals inc which became a major player in the hard disk drive market it was the worldwide leader in 14-inch disk drive technology in the oem marketplace in the 1970s and early 1980s especially with its smd storage module drive and cmd cartridge module drive in the second half of the 1970s honeywell started to look to international markets again acquiring the french compagnie internationale pour linformatique in 1976 9:124 eight years later honeywell formed honeywell high tech trading to lease their foreign marketing and distribution to other companies abroad in order to establish a better position in those markets 9:147 under bingers stewardship from 1961 to 1978 he expanded the company into such fields as defense aerospace and computing during and after the vietnam era honeywells defense division produced a number of products including cluster bombs missile guidance systems napalm and land mines minnesota-honeywell corporation completed flight tests on an inertia guidance sub-system for the x-20 project at eglin air force base florida utilizing an nf-101b voodoo by august 1963 the x-20 project was canceled in december 1963 13 the honeywell project founded in 1968 organized protests against the company to persuade it to abandon weapons production 14 in 1980 honeywell bought incoterm corporation to compete in both the airline reservations system networks and bank teller markets in the 1980s honeywell developed the first digital process communications protocol for its smart transmitters used in process measurement since then smart communication protocols have evolved into various standardized types such as the hart protocol and de protocol integration aerospace and home  building controls 1986–1999edit aerospaceedit 1986 marked a new direction for honeywell beginning with the acquisition of sperry aerospace 8 the same year they conceded control of the computer market to ibm and discontinued their computer business in 1990 honeywell spun off their defense and marine systems business into alliant techsystems as well as their test instruments division and signal analysis center to streamline the companys focus 9:177 honeywell continues to supply aerospace products including electronic guidance systems cockpit instrumentation lighting and primary propulsion and secondary power turbine engines in 1996 honeywell acquired duracraft and began marketing its products in the home comfort sector today kaz incorporated licenses and sells both duracraft and honeywells home comfort lines honeywell is in the consortium that runs the pantex plant that assembles all of the nuclear bombs in the united states arsenal honeywell federal manufacturing  technologies successor to the defense products of alliedsignal operates the kansas city plant which produces and assembles 85 percent of the non-nuclear components of the bombs 15 home  building controlsedit honeywell also began the smarthouse project to combine heating cooling security lighting and appliances into one easily controlled system they continued the trend in 1987 by releasing new security systems and fire and radon detectors five years later in another streamlining effort honeywell combined their residential controls commercial systems and protections services divisions into home and building control which then acquired the enviracare air cleaner business 9:183 by 1995 honeywell had condensed into three divisions space and aviation control home and building control and industrial control corporate takeovers 1999–2002edit alliedsignal and pittwayedit on june 7 1999 honeywell was acquired by alliedsignal who elected to retain the honeywell name for its brand recognition 8 the former honeywell moved their headquarters of 114 years to alliedsignals in morristown nj while technically the deal looks more like an acquisition than a mergerfrom a strategic standpoint it is a merger of equals 16 alliedsignals 1998 revenue was reported at $15.1 billion to honeywells $8.4 billion but together the companies share huge business interests in aerospace chemical products automotive parts and building controls in 2000 the new honeywell acquired pittway for $2.2 billion to gain a greater share of the fire-protection and security systems market and merged it into their home and building control division 17 taking on pittways $167 million in debt analyst david jarrett commented that while honeywell offered a hefty premium its still getting pittway for a bargain at $45.50 per share despite closing at $29 the week before 18 pittways ademco products complemented honeywells existing unified controls systems general electric companyedit in october 2000 honeywell then valued at over $21 billion accepted a takeover bid from then-ceo jack welch of general electric 19 the american department of justice cleared the merger while ge teams swooped down on honeywell and ge executives took over budget planning and employee reviews however on july 3 2001 the european commissions competition commissioner mario monti blocked the move 20 this decision was taken on the grounds that with ges dominance of the large jet engine market led by the general electric cf34 turbofan engine its leasing services gecas and honeywells portfolio of regional jet engines and avionics the new company would be able to bundle products and stifle competition through the creation of a horizontal monopoly us regulators disagreed finding that the merger would improve competition and reduce prices united states assistant attorney general charles james called the eus decision antithetical to the goals of antitrust law enforcement 21 22 this led to a drop in morale and general tumult throughout honeywell and in turn the then-ceo michael bonsignore was fired as honeywell looked to turn their business around recent historyedit the current honeywell international inc is the product of a merger between alliedsignal and honeywell inc although alliedsignal was twice the size of honeywell the combined company chose the name honeywell because of its superior brand recognition however the corporate headquarters were consolidated to alliedsignals headquarters in morristown new jersey rather than honeywells former headquarters in minneapolis minnesota when honeywell closed its corporate headquarters in minneapolis over one thousand employees lost their jobs a few moved to morristown or other company locations but the majority were forced to find new jobs or retire soon after the merger the companys stock fell significantly and did not return to its pre-merger level until 2007 in january 2002 knorr-bremse who had been operating in a joint venture with honeywell international inc assumed full ownership of its ventures in europe brazil and the usa bendix commercial vehicle systems became a subsidiary of knorr-bremse ag although declining in influence honeywell maintains a presence in emerging industries such as northern albertas oil sands honeywells plant integrator is currently deployed in some of the most important plant-sites in the oil sands syncrude suncor and others in february 2002 honeywells board appointed their current ceo and chairman david m cote cote has been instrumental in uniting the company cultures of honeywell alliedsignal and pittway since 2002 honeywell has made more than 80 acquisitions and 60 divestures while adding $12 billion in new sales 23 and increasing its labor
