condenser heat transfer in systems involving heat transfer a condenser is a device or unit used to condense a substance from its gaseous to its liquid state by cooling it in so doing the latent heat is given up by the substance and will transfer to the condenser coolant condensers are typically heat exchangers which have various designs and come in many sizes ranging from rather small hand-held to very large industrial-scale units used in plant processes for example a refrigerator uses a condenser to get rid of heat extracted from the interior of the unit to the outside air condensers are used in air conditioning industrial chemical processes such as distillation steam power plants and other heat-exchange systems use of cooling water or surrounding air as the coolant is common in many condensers 1 contents 1 examples of condensers 2 equation 3 see also 4 references  examples of condensersedit a surface condenser is an example of such a heat-exchange system it is a shell and tube heat exchanger installed at the outlet of every steam turbine in thermal power stations commonly the cooling water flows through the tube side and the steam enters the shell side where the condensation occurs on the outside of the heat transfer tubes the condensate drips down and collects at the bottom often in a built-in pan called a hotwell the shell side often operates at a vacuum or partial vacuum produced by the difference in specific volume between the steam and condensate conversely the vapor can be fed through the tubes with the coolant water or air flowing around the outside in chemistry a condenser is the apparatus which cools hot vapors causing them to condense into a liquid see condenser laboratory for laboratory-scale condensers as opposed to industrial-scale condensers examples include the liebig condenser graham condenser and allihn condenser this is not to be confused with a condensation reaction which links two fragments into a single molecule by an addition reaction and an elimination reaction larger condensers are also used in industrial-scale distillation processes to cool distilled vapor into liquid distillate commonly the coolant flows through the tube side and distilled vapor through the shell side with distillate collecting at or flowing out the bottom a condenser unit used in central air conditioning systems typically has a heat exchanger section to cool down and condense incoming refrigerant vapor into liquid a compressor to raise the pressure of the refrigerant and move it along and a fan for blowing outside air through the heat exchanger section to cool the refrigerant inside a typical configuration of such a condenser unit is as follows the heat exchanger section wraps around the sides of the unit with the compressor inside in this heat exchanger section the refrigerant goes through multiple tube passes which are surrounded by heat transfer fins through which cooling air can move from outside to inside the unit there is a motorized fan inside the condenser unit near the top which is covered by some grating to keep any objects from accidentally falling inside on the fan the fan is used to blow the outside cooling air in through the heat exchange section at the sides and out the top through the grating these condenser units are located on the outside of the building they are trying to cool with tubing between the unit and building one for vapor refrigerant entering and another for liquid refrigerant leaving the unit of course an electric power supply is needed for the compressor and fan inside the unit direct contact condenser other types of condensers in the world of heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac condensers happen to be a topic of great importance instead of confusing information the goal is to provide some basic information on the different types of condensers and their applications there are three other condensers used in hvac systems water-cooled air-cooled evaporative applications air cooled  if the condenser is located on the outside of the unit the air cooled condenser can provide the easiest arrangement these types of condensers eject heat to the outdoors and are simple to install most common uses for this condenser are domestic refrigerators upright freezers and in residential packaged air conditioning units a great feature of the air cooled condenser is they are very easy to clean since dirt can cause serious issues with the condensers performance it is highly recommended that these be kept clear of dirt water cooled  although a little more pricey to install these condensers are the more efficient type commonly used for swimming pools and condensers piped for city water flow these condensers require regular service and maintenance  they also require a cooling tower to conserve water to prevent corrosion and the forming of algae water cooled condensers require a constant supply of makeup water along with water treatment  depending on the application you can choose from tube in tube shell and coil or shell and tube condensers all are essentially made to produce the same outcome but each in a different way evaporative  while these remain the least popular choice evaporative condensers can be used inside or outside of a building and under typical conditions operate at a low condensing temperature  typically these are used in large commercial air-conditioning units although effective they are not necessarily the most efficient  prior to beginning your install make sure you choose a condenser that will provide you with the most efficient use equationedit for an ideal single-pass condenser whose coolant has constant density constant heat capacity linear enthalpy over the temperature range perfect cross-sectional
