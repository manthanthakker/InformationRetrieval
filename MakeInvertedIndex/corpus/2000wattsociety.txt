eth zurich which pictures the average first world citizen reducing their overall average primary energy usage to no more than 2,000 watts  48 kilowatt-hours per day by the year 2050  and without lowering their standard of living the concept addresses not only personal or household energy use but the total for the whole society including embodied energy divided by the population two thousand watts is approximately the current world average rate of total primary energy use this compares to averages of around 6,000 watts in western europe 12,000 watts in the united states 1 1,500 watts in china 1,000 watts in india 500 watts in south africa and only 300 watts in bangladesh 2 switzerland itself currently using an average of around 5,000 watts was last a 2000-watt society in the 1960s it is further envisaged that the use of carbon based fuels would be ultimately cut to no more than 500 watts per person within 50 to 100 years the vision was developed in response to concerns about climate change energy security and the future availability of energy supplies it is supported by the swiss federal office of energy 3 the association of swiss architects and engineers and other bodies

swiss person as of july 2008 1500 watts for living and office space this includes heat and hot water 1100 watts for food and consumer discretionary including transportation of these to the point of sale 600 watts for electricity 500 watts for automobile travel 250 watts for air travel 150 watts for public transportation 900 watts for public infrastructure implicationsedit researchers in switzerland believe that this vision is achievable despite a projected 65 increase in economic growth by 2050 by using new low-carbon technologies and techniques 6 it is envisaged that achieving the aim of a 2000-watt society will require amongst other measures a complete reinvestment in the countrys capital assets refurbishment of the nations building stock to bring it up to low energy building standards significant improvements in the efficiency of road transport aviation and energy-intensive material use the possible introduction of high-speed maglev trains the use of renewable energy sources district heating microgeneration and related technologies and a refocusing of research into new priority areas as a result of the intensified research and development effort required it is hoped that switzerland will become a leader in the technologies involved indeed the idea has a great deal of government backing due to fears about climate change the basel pilot regionedit launched in 2001 and located in the metropolitan area of basel pilot region basel aims to develop and commercialise some of the technologies involved the pilot is a partnership between industry universities research institutes and the authorities coordinated by novatlantiscitation needed participation is not restricted to locally based organisations the city of zurich joined the project in 2005 and the canton of geneva declared its interest in 2008 within the pilot region the projects in progress include demonstration buildings constructed to minergie or passivhaus standards electricity generation from renewable energy sources and vehicles using natural gas hydrogen and biogas the aim is to put research into practice seek continuous improvements and to communicate progress to all interested
