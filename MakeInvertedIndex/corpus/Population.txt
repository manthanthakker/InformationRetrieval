population a population is the number of all the organisms of the same group or species which live in a particular geographical area and have the capability of interbreeding 1 2 in ecology the population of a certain species in a certain area is estimated using the lincoln index the area that is used to define a sexual population is defined as the area where inter-breeding is potentially possible between any pair within the area the probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability of cross-breeding with individuals from other areas under normal conditions breeding is substantially more common within the area than across the border 3 in sociology population refers to a collection of humans demography is a social science which entails the statistical study of human populations this article refers mainly to human population  contents 1 population genetics ecology 2 world human population 2.1 predicted growth and decline 2.2 control 3 see also 4 references 5

together this means that they can regularly exchange gametes to produce normally-fertile offspring and such a breeding group is also known therefore as a gamodeme this also implies that all members belong to the same of species such as humans 4 if the gamodeme is very large theoretically approaching infinity and all gene alleles are uniformly distributed by the gametes within it the gamodeme is said to be panmictic under this state allele gamete frequencies can be converted to genotype zygote frequencies by expanding an appropriate quadratic equation as shown by sir ronald fisher in his establishment of quantitative genetics 5 this seldom occurs in nature localisation of gamete exchange  through dispersal limitations or preferential mating or cataclysm or other cause  may lead to small actual gamodemes which exchange gametes reasonably uniformly within themselves but are virtually separated from their neighbouring gamodemes however there may be low frequencies of exchange with these neighbours this may be viewed as the breaking up of a large sexual population panmictic into smaller overlapping sexual populations this failure of panmixia leads to two important changes in overall population structure  1 the component gamodemes vary through gamete sampling in their allele frequencies when compared with each other and with the theoretical panmictic original this is known as dispersion and its details can be estimated using expansion of an appropriate binomial equation and  2 the level of homozygosity rises in the entire collection of gamodemes the overall rise in homozygosity is quantified by the inbreeding coefficient f or φ note that all homozygotes are increased in frequency  both the deleterious and the desirable the mean phenotype of the gamodemes collection is lower than that of the panmictic original  which is known as inbreeding depression it is most important to note however that some dispersion lines will be superior to the panmictic original while some will be about the same and some will be inferior the probabilities of each can be estimated from those binomial equations in plant and animal breeding procedures have been developed which deliberately utilise the effects of dispersion such as line breeding pure-line breeding back-crossing it can be shown that dispersion-assisted selection leads to the greatest genetic advance δg  change in the phenotypic mean and is much more powerful than selection acting without attendant dispersion this is so for both allogamous random fertilization 6 and autogamous self-fertilization gamodemes 7 world human populationedit as of todays date the world population is estimated by the united states census bureau to be 7.462 billion 8 the us census bureau estimates the 7 billion number was surpassed on 12 march 2012 according to a separate estimate by the united nations earths population exceeded seven billion in october 2011 a milestone that offers unprecedented challenges and opportunities to all of humanity according to unfpa the united nations population fund 9 according to papers published by the united states census bureau the world population hit 6.5 billion on 24 february 2006 the united nations population fund designated 12 october 1999 as the approximate day on which world population reached 6 billion this was about 12 years after world population reached 5 billion in 1987 and 6 years after world population reached 5.5 billion in 1993 the population of countries such as nigeria is not even known to the nearest million 10 so there is a considerable margin of error in such estimates 11 researcher carl haub calculated that a total of over 100 billion people have probably been born in the last 2000 years 12 predicted growth and declineedit population growth increased significantly as the industrial revolution gathered pace from 1700 onwards 13 the last 50 years have seen a yet more rapid increase in the rate of population growth 13 due to medical advances and substantial increases in agricultural productivity particularly beginning in the 1960s 14 made by the green revolution 15 in 2007 the united nations population division projected that the worlds population will likely surpass 10 billion in 2055 16 in the future the worlds population is expected to peak 17 after which it will decline due to economic reasons health concerns land exhaustion and environmental hazards according to one report it is very likely that the worlds population will stop growing before the end of the 21st century further there is some likelihood that population will actually decline before 2100 18 19 population has already declined in the last decade or two in eastern europe the baltics and in the commonwealth of independent states 20 the population pattern of less-developed regions of the world in recent years has been marked by gradually declining birth rates these followed an earlier sharp reduction in death rates 21 this transition from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates is often referred to as the demographic transition 21 controledit human population control is the practice of altering the rate of growth of a human population historically human population control has been implemented with the goal of increasing the rate of population growth in the period from the 1950s to the 1980s concerns about global population growth and its effects on poverty environmental degradation and political stability led to efforts to reduce population growth rates while population control can involve measures that improve peoples lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction a few programmes most notably the chinese governments one-child per family policy have resorted to coercive measures in the 1970s tension grew between population control advocates and womens health activists who advanced womens reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach 22 growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant change in population control policies in the early 1980s 23 see alsoedit community ecology list of countries
