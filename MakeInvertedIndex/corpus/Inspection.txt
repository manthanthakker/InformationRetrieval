inspection an inspection is most generally an organized examination or formal evaluation exercise in engineering activities inspection involves the measurements tests and gauges applied to certain characteristics in regard to an object or activity the results are usually compared to specified requirements and standards for determining whether the item or activity is in line with these targets often with a standard inspection procedure in place to ensure consistent checking inspections are usually non-destructive inspections may be a visual inspection or involve sensing technologies such as ultrasonic testing accomplished with a direct physical presence or remotely such as a remote visual inspection and manually or automatically such as an automated optical inspection non-contact optical measurement and photogrammetry have become common ndt methods for inspection of manufactured components and design optimisation a 2007 scottish government review of scrutiny of public services the crear review 2007 1 1 defined inspection of public services as  periodic targeted scrutiny of specific services to check whether they are meeting national and local performance standards legislative and professional requirements and the needs of service users a surprise inspection tends to have different results than an announced inspection leaders wanting to know how others in their organization perform can drop in without warning to see directly what happens if an inspection is made known in advance it can give people a chance to cover up or to fix mistakes this could lead to distorted and inaccurate findings a surprise inspection therefore gives inspectors a better picture of the typical state of the inspected object or process than an announced inspection it also enhances external confidence in the inspection process see section 4.12 of the crear report 1  contents 1 specific inspection 1.1 manufacturing 1.2 fire equipment 1.3 business 1.4 government 1.5 road vehicles 1.6

inspectionverification is an essential part of quality control in manufacturing inspection in manufacturing includes measuring examining testing or gauging one or more characteristics of a product or process and comparing the results with specified requirements to determine whether is the requirements are met for each characteristic 3 4 common examples of inspection by measurement or gauging include using a caliper or micrometer to determine if a machined dimension of a manufactured part is within the dimensional tolerance specified in a drawing for that part and is thus acceptable for use design for inspection dfi is a concept that should complement and work in collaboration with design for manufacturability dfm and design for assembly dma to reduce product manufacturing cost and increase manufacturing practicality photogrammetry is a modern way of visual inspection delivering high accuracy and traceability for various industries the portable 3d system is a versatile optical coordinate measuring machine cmm with a wide range of capabilities highly accurate point measurements can be taken with inspection carried out directly to cad models geometry or drawings 5dfi fire equipmentedit most fire equipment needs to be inspected to make sure in the event of a fire every effort has been taken to make sure it doesnt get out of control extinguishers are to be inspected every month by law and inspected by a servicing company at least once a year businessedit in international trade several destination countries require pre-shipment inspection the importer instructs the shipper which inspection company should be used the inspector makes pictures and a report to certify that the goods that are being shipped and produced are in accordance with the accompanying documents commodity inspection is other term that is used between buyers and sellers the scope of work for commodity inspection depends to the buyers some buyers hire the inspection agencies only for pre-shipment inspections ie visual quality quantity packing marking and loading inspections and some others request for higher level inspections and ask inspection agencies to attend in the vendor shops and inspect commodities during manufacturing processes normally inspection is done based on an agreed inspection and test plan itp 6 governmentedit in government and politics an inspection is the act of a monitoring authority administering an official review of various criteria such as documents facilities records and any other assets that are deemed by the authority to be related to the inspection inspections are used for the purpose of determining if a body is complying with regulations the inspector examines the criteria and talks with involved individuals a report and evaluation

eg an annual inspection is a necessary inspection required on vehicles to conform with laws regarding safety emissions or both it consists of an examination of a vehicles components usually done by a certified mechanic vehicles pass a pre-warranty inspection if and only if a mechanic provide evidence for the proper working condition of the vehicle systems specified in the type of inspection engineering mechanicsedit a mechanical inspection is usually undertaken to ensure the safety or reliability of structures or machinery 7 in europe bodies involved in engineering inspection may be assessed by accreditation bodies according to iso 17020 general criteria for the operation of various types of bodies performing inspection this standard defines inspection as examination of a product process service or installation or their design and determination of its conformity with specific requirements or on the basis of professional judgment with general requirements 8 non-destructive examination nde or nondestructive testing ndt is a family of technologies used during inspection to analyze materials components and products for either inherent defects such as fractures or cracks or service induced defects damage from use some common methods are visual industrial computed tomography scanning microscopy dye penetrant inspection magnetic-particle inspection x-ray or radiographic testing ultrasonic testing eddy-current testing acoustic emission testing and thermographic inspection in addition many non-destructive inspections can be performed by a precision scale or when in motion a checkweigher stereo microscopes are often used for examining small products like circuit boards for product defects inspection and technical assistance during turnarounds helps to decrease costly downtime as well as ensures restart of operations quickly and safely  9  2 medicaledit a medical inspection is the thorough and unhurried visualization of a patient this requires the use of the
