island or te ika-a-māui and the south island or te waipounamuand numerous smaller islands new zealand is situated some 1,500 kilometres  900mi east of australia across the tasman sea and roughly 1,000 kilometres  600mi south of the pacific island areas of new caledonia fiji and tonga because of its remoteness it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans during its long period of isolation new zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of animal fungal and plant life the countrys varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks such as the southern alps owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions new zealands capital city is wellington while its most populous city is auckland sometime between 1250 and 1300 ce polynesians settled in the islands that would later become new zealand and developed a distinctive māori culture in 1642 abel tasman a dutch explorer became the first european to sight new zealand 11 in 1840 representatives of the british crown and māori chiefs signed the treaty of waitangi making new zealand a british colony today the majority of new zealands population of 4.7 million is of european descent the indigenous māori are the largest minority followed by asians and pacific islanders reflecting this new zealands culture is mainly derived from māori and early british settlers with recent broadening arising from increased immigration the official languages are english māori and new zealand sign language with english predominant new zealand is a developed country with a market economy new zealand is a high-income economy and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance such as health education economic freedom and quality of life nationally legislative authority is vested in an elected unicameral parliament while executive political power is exercised by the cabinet led by the prime minister who is currently john key queen elizabeth ii is the countrys head of state and is represented by a governor-general in addition new zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes the realm of new zealand also includes tokelau a dependent territory the cook islands and niue self-governing states in free association with new zealand and the ross dependency which is new zealands territorial claim in antarctica new zealand is a member of

9.1 footnotes 9.2 citations etymology dutch explorer abel tasman sighted new zealand in 1642 and called it staten landt supposing it was connected to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of south america 12 in 1645 dutch cartographers renamed the land nova zeelandia after the dutch province of zeeland 13 14 british explorer james cook subsequently anglicised the name to new zealandn 7 aotearoa often translated as land of the long white cloud 15 is the current māori name for new zealand it is unknown whether māori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of europeans with aotearoa originally referring to just the north island 16 māori had several traditional names for the two main islands including te ika-a-māui the fish of māui for the north island and te waipounamu the waters of greenstone or te waka o aoraki the canoe of aoraki for the south island 17 early european maps labelled the islands north north island middle south island and south stewart island  rakiura 18 in 1830 maps began to use north and south to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907 this was the accepted norm 19 the new zealand geographic board discovered in 2009 that the names of the north island and south island had never been formalised and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013 this set the names as north island or te ika-a-māui and south island or te waipounamu 20 note that for each island either its english or māori name can be used or both can be used together history new zealand was one of the last major landmasses settled by humans radiocarbon dating evidence of deforestation 22 and mitochondrial dna variability within māori populations 23 suggest new zealand was first settled by eastern polynesians between 1250 and 1300 17 24 concluding a long series of voyages through the southern pacific islands 25 over the centuries that followed these settlers developed a distinct culture now known as māori the population was divided into iwi tribes and hapū subtribes who would sometimes cooperate sometimes compete and sometimes fight against each other at some point a group of māori migrated to the chatham islands which they named rēkohu where they developed their distinct moriori culture 26 27 the moriori population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862 largely because of taranaki māori invasion and enslavement in the 1830s although european diseases also contributed in 1862 only 101 survived and the last known full-blooded moriori died in 1933 28 the first europeans known to have reached new zealand were dutch explorer abel tasman and his crew in 1642 29 in a hostile encounter four crew members were killed and at least one māori was hit by canister shot 30 europeans did not revisit new zealand until 1769 when british explorer james cook mapped almost the entire coastline 29 following cook new zealand was visited by numerous european and north american whaling sealing and trading ships they traded european food metal tools weapons and other goods for timber māori food artifacts and water 31 the introduction of the potato and the musket transformed māori agriculture and warfare potatoes provided a reliable food surplus which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns 32 the resulting intertribal musket wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840 killing 30,000–40,000 māori 33 from the early 19th century christian missionaries began to settle new zealand eventually converting most of the māori population 34 the māori population declined to around 40 of its pre-contact level during the 19th century introduced diseases were the major factor 35 in 1788 captain arthur phillip assumed the position of governor of the new british colony of new south wales which according to his commission included new zealand 36 the british government appointed james busby as british resident to new zealand in 1832 following a petition from northern māori 37 in 1835 following an announcement of impending french settlement by charles de thierry the nebulous united tribes of new zealand sent a declaration of the independence to king william iv of the united kingdom asking for protection 37 ongoing unrest the proposed settlement of new zealand by the new zealand company which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from māori and the dubious legal standing of the declaration of independence prompted the colonial office to send captain william hobson to claim sovereignty for great britain and negotiate a treaty with the māori 38 the treaty of waitangi was first signed in the bay of islands on 6 february 1840 39 in response to the new zealand companys attempts to establish an independent settlement in wellington 40 and french settlers purchasing land in akaroa 41 hobson declared british sovereignty over all of new zealand on 21 may 1840 even though copies of the treaty were still circulating throughout the country for māori to sign 42 with the signing of the treaty and declaration of sovereignty the number of immigrants particularly from the united kingdom began to increase 43 new zealand still part of the colony of new south wales became a separate colony of new zealand on 1 july 1841 44 the colony gained a representative government in 1852 and the first parliament met in 1854 45 in 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing gaining responsibility over all domestic matters other than native policy 45 control over native policy was granted in the mid-1860s 45 following concerns that the south island might form a separate colony premier alfred domett moved a resolution to transfer the capital from auckland to a locality near the cook strait 46 wellington was chosen for its harbour and central location with parliament officially sitting there for the first time in 1865 as immigrant numbers increased conflicts over land led to the new zealand wars of the 1860s and 1870s resulting in the loss and confiscation of much māori land 47 in 1891 the liberal party led by john ballance came to power as the first organised political party the liberal government later led by richard seddon passed many important social and economic measures in 1893 new zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all women the right to vote 48 and in 1894 pioneered the adoption of compulsory arbitration between employers and unions 49 in 1898 seddons government passed the old-age pensions act of 1898 the first general pensions scheme in the british empire in 1907 at the request of the new zealand parliament king edward vii proclaimed new zealand a dominion within the british empire reflecting its self-governing status accordingly the title dominion of new zealand dates from 1907 50 51 in 1947 the country adopted the statute of westminster confirming that the british parliament could no longer legislate for new zealand without the consent of new zealand 45 early in the 20th century new zealand was involved in world affairs fighting in the first and second world wars 52 and suffering through the great depression 53 the depression led to the election of the first labour government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy 54 new zealand experienced increasing prosperity following world war ii 55 and māori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work 56 a māori protest movement developed which criticised eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of māori culture and the treaty of waitangi 57 in 1975 a waitangi tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the treaty and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985 39 the government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi although māori claims to the foreshore and seabed have proved controversial in the 2000s politics government new zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy 58 although its constitution is not codified 59 elizabeth ii is the queen of new zealand and the head of state 60 the queen is represented by the governor-general whom she appoints on the advice of the prime minister 61 62 the governor-general can exercise the crowns prerogative powers such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers ambassadors and other key public officials 63 and in rare situations the reserve powers eg the power to dissolve parliament or refuse the royal assent of a bill into law 64 the powers of the queen and the governor-general are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of cabinet 64 65 the new zealand parliament holds legislative power and consists of the queen and the house of representatives 65 it also included an upper house the legislative council until this was abolished in 1950 65 the supremacy of parliament over the crown and other government institutions was established in england by the bill of rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in new zealand 65 the house of representatives is democratically elected and a government is formed from the party or coalition with the majority of seats 65 if no majority is formed a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured the governor-general appoints ministers under advice from the prime minister 66 who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition cabinet formed by ministers and led by the prime minister currently john key is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions 67 by convention members of cabinet are bound by collective responsibility to decisions made by cabinet 68 almost all parliamentary general elections between 1853 and 1993 were held under the first-past-the-post voting system 69 the elections since 1930 have been dominated by two political parties national and labour 69 since the 1996 election a form of proportional representation called mixed member proportional mmp has been used 59 under the mmp system each person has two votes one is for electoral seats including some reserved for māori 70 and the other is for a party since the 2014 election there have been 71 electorate seats which includes 7 māori electorates and the remaining 49 seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote although a party has to win one electoral seat or 5 of the total party vote before it is eligible for these seats 71 between march 2005 and august 2006 new zealand became the only country in the world in which all the highest offices in the landhead of state governor-general prime minister speaker and chief justicewere occupied simultaneously by women 72 judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain constitutional independence from the government 59 this theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by parliament without other influences on their decisions 73 the privy council in london was the countrys final court of appeal until 2004 when it was replaced with the newly established supreme court of new zealand the judiciary headed by the chief justice 74 includes the court of appeal the high court and subordinate courts 59 new zealand is identified as one of the worlds most stable and well-governed nations 75 as of 2011update the country was ranked fifth in the strength of its democratic institutions 76 and first in government transparency and lack of corruption 77 new zealand has a high level of civic participation with 79 voter turnout during the most recent elections compared to an oecd average of 72 furthermore 67 of new zealanders say they trust their political institutions far higher than the oecd average of 56 78 foreign relations and the military early colonial new zealand allowed the british government to determine external trade and be responsible for foreign policy 79 the 1923 and 1926 imperial conferences decided that new zealand should be allowed to negotiate their own political treaties and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with japan on 3 september 1939 new zealand allied itself with britain and declared war on germany with prime minister michael savage proclaiming where she goes we go where she stands we stand 80 in 1951 the united kingdom became increasingly focused on its european interests 81 while new zealand joined australia and the united states in the anzus security treaty 82 the influence of the united states on new zealand weakened following protests over the vietnam war 83 the refusal of the united states to admonish france after the sinking of the rainbow warrior 84 disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues and new zealands nuclear-free policy 85 86 despite the uss suspension of anzus obligations the treaty remained in effect between new zealand and australia whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend 87 close political contact is maintained between the two countries with free trade agreements and travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit live and work in both countries without restrictions 88 in 2013 there are about 650,000 new zealand citizens living in australia which is about 15 of the population of new zealand 89 65,000 australians live in new zealand 88 new zealand has a strong presence among the pacific island countries a large proportion of new zealands aid goes to these countries and many pacific people migrate to new zealand for employment 90 permanent migration is regulated under the 1970 samoan quota scheme and the 2002 pacific access category which allow up to 1,100 samoan nationals and up to 750 other pacific islanders respectively to become permanent new zealand residents each year a seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was introduced in 2007 and in 2009 about 8,000 pacific islanders were employed under it 91 new zealand is involved in the pacific islands forum asia-pacific economic cooperation and the association of southeast asian nations regional forum including the east asia summit 88 new zealand is also a member of the united nations 92 the commonwealth of nations 93 the organisation for economic co-operation and development 94 and the five power defence arrangements 95 the new zealand defence force has three branches the royal new zealand navy the new zealand army and the royal new zealand air force 96 new zealands national defence needs are modest because of the unlikelihood of direct attack 97 although it does have a global presence the country fought in both world wars with notable campaigns in gallipoli crete 98 el alamein 99 and cassino 100 the gallipoli campaign played an important part in fostering new zealands national identity 101 102 and strengthened the anzac tradition it shares with australia 103 according to mary edmond-paul world war i had left scars on new zealand society with nearly 18,500 in total dying as a result of the war more than 41,000 wounded and others affected emotionally out of an overseas fighting force of about 103,000 and a population of just over a million 104 new zealand also played key parts in the naval battle of the river plate 105 and the battle of britain air campaign 106 107 during world war ii the united states had more than 400,000 american military personnel stationed in new zealand 108 in addition to vietnam and the two world wars new zealand fought in the korean war the second boer war 109 the malayan emergency 110 the gulf war and the afghanistan war it has contributed forces to several regional and global peacekeeping missions such as those in cyprus somalia bosnia and herzegovina the sinai angola cambodia the iraniraq border bougainville east timor and the solomon islands 111 new zealand also sent a unit of army engineers to help rebuild iraqi infrastructure for one year during the iraq war new zealand ranks 8th in the center for global developments 2012 commitment to development index which ranks the worlds most developed countries on their dedication to policies that benefit poorer nations 112 new zealand is considered the fourth most peaceful country in the world according to the 2016 global peace index 113 local government and external territories the early european settlers divided new zealand into provinces which had a degree of autonomy 114 because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways education land sales and other policies government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876 115 as a result new zealand now has no separately represented subnational entities the provinces are remembered in regional public holidays 116 and sporting rivalries 117 since 1876 various councils have administered local areas under legislation determined by the central government 114 118 in 1989 the government reorganised local government into the current two-tier structure of regional councils and territorial authorities 119 the 249 municipalities 119 that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 territorial authorities and 11 regional councils 120 the regional councils role is to regulate the natural environment with particular emphasis on resource management 119 while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage water local roads building consents and other local matters 121 122 five of the territorial councils are unitary authorities and also act as regional councils 122 the territorial authorities consist of 13 city councils 53 district councils and the chatham islands council while officially the chatham islands council is not a unitary authority it undertakes many functions of a regional council 123 new zealand is one of 16 realms within the commonwealth 124 125 the realm of new zealand is the territory over which the queen of new zealand is sovereign and comprises new zealand tokelau the ross dependency the cook islands and niue 125 the cook islands and niue are self-governing states in free association with new zealand 126 127 the new zealand parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence tokelau is a non-self-governing territory that uses the new zealand flag and anthem but is administered by a council of three elders one from each tokelauan atoll 128 129 the ross dependency is new zealands territorial claim in antarctica where it operates the scott base research facility 130 new zealand citizenship law treats all parts of the realm equally so most people born in new zealand the cook islands niue tokelau and the ross dependency before 2006 are new zealand citizens further conditions apply for those born from 2006 onwards 131 v t e environment geography new zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made up of two main islands and a number of smaller islands the two main islands the north island or te ika-a-māui and the south island or te waipounamu are separated by the cook strait 22 kilometres  14mi wide at its narrowest point 132 besides the north and south islands the five largest inhabited islands are stewart island the chatham islands great barrier island in the hauraki gulf 133 durville island in the marlborough sounds 134 and waiheke island about 22km  14mi from central auckland 135 the countrys islands lie between latitudes 29 and 53s and longitudes 165 and 179e new zealand is long and narrow over 1,600 kilometres  990mi along its north-north-east axis with a maximum width of 400 kilometres  250mi 136 with about 15,000km  9,300mi of coastline 137 and a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres  103,500sqmi 138 because of its far-flung outlying islands and long coastline the country has extensive marine resources its exclusive economic zone is one of the largest in the world covering more than 15 times its land area 139 the south island is the largest landmass of new zealand and is divided along its length by the southern alps 140 there are 18 peaks over 3,000 metres  9,800ft the highest of which is aoraki  mount cook at 3,754 metres  12,316ft 141 fiordlands steep mountains and deep fiords record the extensive ice age glaciation of this south-western corner of the south island 142 the north island is less mountainous but is marked by volcanism 143 the highly active taupo volcanic zone has formed a large volcanic plateau punctuated by the north islands highest mountain mount ruapehu  2,797 metres  9,177ft the plateau also hosts the countrys largest lake lake taupo 144 nestled in the caldera of one of the worlds most active supervolcanoes 145 the country owes its varied topography and perhaps even its emergence above the waves to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the pacific and indo-australian plates 146 new zealand is part of zealandia a microcontinent nearly half the size of australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the gondwanan supercontinent 147 about 25 million years ago a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region this is now most evident in the southern alps formed by compression of the crust beside the alpine fault elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other producing the puysegur trench to the south the hikurangi trench east of the north island and the kermadec and tonga trenches 148 further north 146 new zealand and australia are both part of the wider regions known as australasia and oceania the term oceania is often used to denote the region encompassing the australian continent new zealand and various islands in the pacific ocean that are not included in the seven-continent model landscapes of new zealand rural scene near queenstown the emerald lakes mt tongariro lake gunn pencarrow head wellington rural scene near queenstown the emerald lakes mt

the north 149 historical maxima and minima are 42.4c  108.32f in rangiora canterbury and −25.6c −14.08f in ranfurly otago 150 conditions vary sharply across regions from extremely wet on the west coast of the south island to almost semi-arid in central otago and the mackenzie basin of inland canterbury and subtropical in northland 151 of the seven largest cities christchurch is the driest receiving on average only 640 millimetres  25in of rain per year and wellington the wettest receiving almost twice that amount 152 auckland wellington and christchurch all receive a yearly average of more than 2,000 hours of sunshine the southern and south-western parts of the south island have a cooler and cloudier climate with around 1,400–1,600 hours the northern and north-eastern parts of the south island are the sunniest areas of the country and receive about 2,400–2,500 hours 153 the general snow season is about early june until early october in the south island snowfall is less common on the north island although it does occur climates of new zealand autumn in wellington central plateau in winter scorching bay beach in summer autumn in wellington central plateau in winter scorching bay beach in summer the table below lists climate normals for the warmest and coldest month in the six largest cities of new zealand the north island cities are generally slightly warmer in february but the south island cities are warmest in january biodiversity new zealands geographic isolation for 80 million years 155 and island biogeography has influenced evolution of the countrys species of animals fungi and plants physical isolation has not caused biological isolation and this has resulted in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species 156 157 about 82 of new zealands indigenous vascular plants are endemic covering 1,944 species across 65 genera and includes a single endemic family 158 159 the number of fungi recorded from new zealand including lichen-forming species is not known nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in new zealand 158 and 40 of these are endemic 160 the two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps or by southern beech in cooler climates 161 the remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands the majority of which are tussock 162 before the arrival of humans an estimated 80 of the land was covered in forest with only high alpine wet infertile and volcanic areas without trees 163 massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived with around half the forest cover lost to fire after polynesian settlement 164 much of the remaining forest fell after european settlement being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral farming leaving forest occupying only 23 of the land 165 the forests were dominated by birds and the lack of mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi kakapo weka and takahē evolving flightlessness 166 the arrival of humans associated changes to habitat and the introduction of rats ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species including large birds like the moa and haasts eagle 167 168 other indigenous animals are represented by reptiles tuataras skinks and geckos 169 frogs spiders katipo insects weta and snails 170 171 some such as the wrens and tuatara are so unique that they have been called living fossils three species of bats one since extinct were the only sign of native land mammals in new zealand until the 2006 discovery of bones from a unique mouse-sized land mammal at least 16 million years old 172 173 marine mammals however are abundant with almost half the worlds cetaceans whales dolphins and porpoises and large numbers of fur seals reported in new zealand waters 174 many seabirds breed in new zealand a third of them unique to the country 175 more penguin species are found in new zealand than in any other country 176 since human arrival almost half of the countrys vertebrate species have become extinct including at least fifty-one birds three frogs three lizards one freshwater fish and one bat others are endangered or have had their range severely reduced 167 however new zealand conservationists have pioneered several methods to help threatened wildlife recover including island sanctuaries pest control wildlife translocation fostering and ecological restoration of islands and other selected areas 177 178 179 180 economy new zealand has a high-income advanced economy with a nominal gross domestic product gdp per capita of us$36,254 8 the currency is the new zealand dollar informally known as the kiwi dollar it also circulates in the cook islands see cook islands dollar niue tokelau and the pitcairn islands 181 new zealand was ranked sixth in the 2013 human development index 182 fourth in the heritage foundations 2012 index of economic freedom 183 and 13th in inseads 2012 global innovation index 184 historically extractive industries have contributed strongly to new zealands economy focussing at different times on sealing whaling flax gold kauri gum and native timber 185 with the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to britain a trade which provided the basis for strong economic growth in new zealand 186 high demand for agricultural products from the united kingdom and the united states helped new zealanders achieve higher living standards than both australia and western europe in the 1950s and 1960s 187 in 1973 new zealands export market was reduced when the united kingdom joined the european community 188 and other compounding factors such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis led to a severe economic depression 189 living standards in new zealand fell behind those of australia and western europe and by 1982 new zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the world bank 190 since 1984 successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring known first as rogernomics and then ruthanasia rapidly transforming new zealand from a highly protectionist economy to a liberalised free-trade economy 191 192 unemployment peaked above 10 in 1991 and 1992 194 following the 1987 share market crash but eventually fell to a record low of 3.4 in 2007 ranking fifth from twenty-seven comparable oecd nations 195 however the global financial crisis that followed had a major impact on new zealand with the gdp shrinking for five consecutive quarters the longest recession in over thirty years 196 197 and unemployment rising back to 7 in late 2009 198 at may 2012 the general unemployment rate was around 6.7 while the unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 21 was 13.6 199 in the september 2014 quarter unemployment was 5.4 200 new zealand has experienced a series of brain drains since the 1970s 201 that still continue today 202 nearly one quarter of highly skilled workers live overseas mostly in australia and britain which is the largest proportion from any developed nation 203 in recent years however a brain gain has brought in educated professionals from europe and less developed countries 204 205 trade new zealand is heavily dependent on international trade 206 particularly in agricultural products 207 exports account for 24 of its output 137 making new zealand vulnerable to international commodity prices and global economic slowdowns food products made up 55 of the value of all the countrys exports in 2014 wood was the second largest earner  7 208 its major export partners are australia united states japan china and the united kingdom 137 on 7 april 2008 new zealand and china signed the new zealandchina free trade agreement the first such agreement china has signed with a developed country 209 210 the service sector is the largest sector in the economy followed by manufacturing and construction and then farming and raw material extraction 137 tourism plays a significant role in new zealands economy contributing $15.0 billion to new zealands total gdp and supporting 9.6 of the total workforce in 2010 211 international visitors to new zealand increased by 3.1 in the year to october 2010 212 and are expected to increase at a rate of 2.5 annually up to 2015 211 in 1984 new zealand deregulated its agricultural economy by phasing out farm subsidies over a three-year period 213 214 wool was new zealands major agricultural export during the late 19th century 185 even as late as the 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues 185 but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities 215 and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers 216 in contrast dairy farming increased with the number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007 217 to become new zealands largest export earner 218 in the year to

younger 137 by 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5.3 million the median age to rise from 36 years to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18 to 29 239

all non-polynesian new zealanders 249 the māori were the first people to reach new zealand followed by the early european settlers following colonisation immigrants were predominantly from britain ireland and australia because of restrictive policies similar to the white australian policies 250 there was also significant dutch dalmatian 251 italian and german immigration together with indirect european immigration through australia north america south america and south africa 252 following the great depression policies were relaxed and migrant diversity increased in 2009–10 an annual target

education system as the 7th best in the world with students performing exceptionally well in reading mathematics and science 274 culture early māori adapted the tropically based east polynesian culture in line with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment eventually developing their own distinctive culture social organisation was largely communal with families whanau sub-tribes hapu and tribes iwi ruled by a chief rangatira whose position was subject to the communitys approval 275 the british and irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to new zealand and also influenced māori culture 276 277 particularly with the introduction of christianity 278 however māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity and māori kinship roles resemble those of other polynesian peoples 279 more recently american australian asian and other european cultures have exerted influence on new zealand non-māori polynesian cultures are also apparent with pasifika the worlds largest polynesian festival now an annual event in auckland the largely rural life in early new zealand led to the image of new zealanders being rugged industrious problem solvers 280 modesty was expected and enforced through the tall poppy syndrome where high achievers received harsh criticism 281 at the time new zealand was not known as an intellectual country 282 from the early 20th century until the late 1960s māori culture was suppressed by the attempted assimilation of māori into british new zealanders 259 in the 1960s as higher education became more available and cities expanded 283 urban culture began to dominate 284 even though the majority of the population now lives in cities much of new zealands art literature film and humour has rural themes from around the middle of the 20th century many cultural icons called kiwiana started to emerge that now help to define what it means to be a new zealander such as the silver fern and the paua shell art as part of the resurgence of māori culture the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and māori artists are increasing in number and influence 285 most māori carvings feature human figures generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking detailed head or a grotesque head 286 surface patterns consisting of spirals ridges notches and fish scales decorate most carvings 287 the pre-eminent māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses wharenui decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations these buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt changing and adapting to different whims or needs 288 māori decorated the white wood of buildings canoes and cenotaphs using red a mixture of red ochre and shark fat and black made from soot paint and painted pictures of birds reptiles and other designs on cave walls 289 māori tattoos moko consisting of coloured soot mixed with gum were cut into the flesh with a bone chisel 290 since european arrival paintings and photographs have been dominated by landscapes originally not as works of art but as factual portrayals of new zealand 291 portraits of māori were also common with early painters often portraying them as noble savages exotic beauties or friendly natives 291 the countrys isolation delayed the influence of european artistic trends allowing local artists to developed their own distinctive style of regionalism 292 during the 1960s and 70s many artists combined traditional māori and western techniques creating unique art forms 293 new zealand art and craft has gradually achieved an international audience with exhibitions in the venice biennale in 2001 and the paradise now exhibition in new york in 2004 285 294 māori cloaks are made of fine flax fibre and patterned with black red and white triangles diamonds and other geometric shapes 295 greenstone was fashioned into earrings and necklaces with the most well-known design being the hei-tiki a distorted human figure sitting cross-legged with its head tilted to the side 296 europeans brought english fashion etiquette to new zealand and until the 1950s most people dressed up for social occasions 297 standards have since relaxed and new zealand fashion has received a reputation for being casual practical and lacklustre 298 299 however the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000 doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels with some labels gaining international recognition 299 literature māori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas and many of their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form 300 most early english literature was obtained from britain and it was not until the 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that new zealand literature started to become widely known 301 although still largely influenced by global trends modernism and events the great depression writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in new zealand during this period literature changed from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit 302 participation in the world wars gave some new zealand writers a new perspective on new zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished 303 dunedin is a unesco city of literature 304 media and entertainment new zealand music has been influenced by blues jazz country rock and roll and hip hop with many of these genres given a unique new zealand interpretation 305 māori developed traditional chants and songs from their ancient south-east asian origins and after centuries of isolation created a unique monotonous and doleful sound 306 flutes and trumpets were used as musical instruments 307 or as signalling devices during war or special occasions 308 early settlers brought over their ethnic music with brass bands and choral music being popular and musicians began touring new zealand in the 1860s 309 310 pipe bands became widespread during the early 20th century 311 the new zealand recording industry began to develop from
