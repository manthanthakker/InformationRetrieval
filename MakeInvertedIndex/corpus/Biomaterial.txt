biomaterial a biomaterial is any substance that has been engineered to interact with biological systems for a medical purpose - either a therapeutic treat augment repair or replace a tissue function of the body or a diagnostic one as a science biomaterials is about fifty years old the study of biomaterials is called biomaterials science or biomaterials engineering it has experienced steady and strong growth over its history with many companies investing large amounts of money into the development of new products biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine biology chemistry tissue engineering and materials science note that a biomaterial is different from a biological material such as bone that is produced by a biological system additionally care should be exercised in defining a biomaterial as biocompatible since it is application-specific a biomaterial that is biocompatible or suitable for one application may not be biocompatible in another 1 material exploited in contact with living tissues organisms or microorganisms 2abc  contents 1 introduction 2 biomineralization 3 self-assembly 4 structural hierarchy 5 applications 5.1 heart valves 5.2 skin repair 6 compatibility

using a variety of chemical approaches utilizing metallic components polymers ceramics or composite materials they are often used andor adapted for a medical application and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs augments or replaces a natural function such functions may be benign like being used for a heart valve or may be bioactive with a more interactive functionality such as hydroxy-apatite coated hip implants biomaterials are also used every day in dental applications surgery and drug delivery for example a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body which permits the prolonged release of a drug over an extended period of time a biomaterial may also be an autograft allograft or xenograft used as a transplant material biomineralizationedit biomineralization is the process by which living organisms produce minerals 4 often to harden or stiffen existing tissues such tissues are called mineralized tissues it is an extremely widespread phenomenon all six taxonomic kingdoms contain members that are able to form minerals and over 60 different minerals have been identified in organisms 5 6 7 examples include silicates in algae and diatoms carbonates in invertebrates and calcium phosphates and carbonates in vertebrates these minerals often form structural features such as sea shells and the bone in mammals and birds organisms have been producing mineralised skeletons for the past 550 million years other examples include copper iron and gold deposits involving bacteria biologically-formed minerals often have special uses such as magnetic sensors in magnetotactic bacteria fe3o4 gravity sensing devices caco3 caso4 baso4 and iron storage and mobilization fe2o3h2o in the protein ferritin self-assemblyedit self-assembly is the most common term in use in the modern scientific community to describe the spontaneous aggregation of particles atoms molecules colloids micelles etc without the influence of any external forces large groups of such particles are known to assemble themselves into thermodynamically stable structurally well-defined arrays quite reminiscent of one of the 7 crystal systems found in metallurgy and mineralogy eg face-centered cubic body-centered cubic etc the fundamental difference in equilibrium structure is in the spatial scale of the unit cell or lattice parameter in each particular case molecular self-assembly is found widely in biological systems and provides the basis of a wide variety of complex biological structures this includes an emerging class of mechanically superior biomaterials based on microstructural features and designs found in nature thus self-assembly is also emerging as a new strategy in chemical synthesis and nanotechnology molecular crystals liquid crystals colloids micelles emulsions phase-separated polymers thin films and self-assembled monolayers all represent examples of the types of highly ordered structures which are obtained using these techniques the distinguishing feature of these methods is self-organization 8 9 10 structural hierarchyedit nearly all materials could be seen as hierarchically structured especially since the changes in spatial scale bring about different mechanisms of deformation and damage however in biological materials this hierarchical organization is inherent to the microstructure one of the first examples of this in the history of structural biology is the early x-ray scattering work on the hierarchical structure of hair and wool by astbury and woods 11 in bone for example collagen is the building block of the organic matrix  a triple helix with diameter of 1.5nm these tropocollagen molecules are intercalated with the mineral phase hydroxyapatite a calcium phosphate forming fibrils that curl into helicoids of alternating directions these osteons are the basic building blocks of bones with the volume fraction distribution between organic and mineral phase being about 60/40 in another level of complexity the hydroxyapatite crystals are mineral platelets that have a diameter of approximately 70–100nm and thickness of 1nm they originally nucleate at the gaps between collagen fibrils similarly the hierarchy of abalone shell begins at the nanolevel with an organic layer having a thickness of 20–30nm this layer proceeds with single crystals of aragonite a polymorph of caco3 consisting of bricks with dimensions of 0.5 and finishing with layers approximately 0.3mm mesostructure crabs are arthropods whose carapace is made of a mineralized hard component which exhibits brittle fracture and a softer organic component composed primarily of chitin the brittle component is arranged in a helical pattern each of these mineral rods  1 μm diameter contains chitinprotein fibrils with approximately 60nm diameter these fibrils are made of 3nm diameter canals which link the interior and exterior of the shell

staples for wound closure 12 13 pins and screws for fracture stabilisation 14 surgical mesh 15 16 biomaterials must be compatible with the body and there are often issues of biocompatibility which must be resolved before a product can be placed on the market and used in a clinical setting because of this biomaterials are usually subjected to the same requirements as those undergone by new drug therapies 17 18 all manufacturing companies are also required to ensure traceability of all of their products so that if a defective product is discovered others in the same batch may be traced heart valvesedit in the united states 45 of the 250,000 valve replacement procedures performed annually involve a mechanical valve implant the most widely used valve is a bileaflet disc heart valve or st jude valve the mechanics involve two semicircular discs moving back and forth with both allowing the flow of blood as well as the ability to form a seal against backflow the valve is coated with pyrolytic carbon and secured to the surrounding tissue with a mesh of woven fabric called dacrontm du ponts trade name for polyethylene terephthalate the mesh allows for the bodys tissue to grow while incorporating the valve 19 skin repairedit most of the time artificial tissue is grown from the patients own cells however when the damage is so extreme that it is impossible to use the patients own cells artificial tissue cells are grown the difficulty is in finding a scaffold that the cells can grow and organize on the characteristics of the scaffold must be that it is biocompatible cells can adhere to the scaffold mechanically strong and biodegradable one successful scaffold is a copolymer of lactic acid and glycolic acid 19 compatibilityedit biocompatibility is related to the behavior of biomaterials in various environments under various chemical and physical conditions the term may refer to specific properties of a material without specifying where or how the material is to be used for example a material may elicit little or no immune response in a given organism and may or may not able to integrate with a particular cell type or tissue the ambiguity of the term reflects the ongoing development of insights into how biomaterials interact with the human body and eventually how those interactions determine the clinical success of a medical device such as pacemaker or hip replacement modern medical devices and prostheses are often made of more than one materialso it might not always be sufficient to talk about the biocompatibility of a specific material  20 biopolymersedit biopolymers are polymers produced by living organisms cellulose and starch proteins and peptides and dna and rna are all examples of biopolymers in which the monomeric units respectively are sugars amino acids and nucleotides 21 cellulose is both the most common biopolymer and the most common organic compound on earth about 33 of all plant matter is cellulose 22 23 see
