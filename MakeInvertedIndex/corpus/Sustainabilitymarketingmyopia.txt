myopia theory was originally proposed in 1960 by american economist theodore levitt according to levitt marketers should not overlook the importance of company potential and product attributes at the expenses of market needs catering for market needs should receive first priority 2 a company besides being technically sound and product oriented also needs to be customer oriented in order to successfully cater for a market knowledge of customer needs and of innovations that can be implemented to maintain customer interest as well as of how to adapt to the changing business market is crucial marketing myopia has been highly influential in the formation of modern marketing theory and was heeded by marketers to such an extent that some authors now speak of a new marketing myopia stemming from too narrow a focus on customer to the exclusion of other stakeholders 3 green marketing myopiaedit green marketing is the marketing of products that are presumed to be environmentally safe 4 in order to be successful green marketing must fulfill two objectives improved environmental quality and customer satisfaction misjudging either or overemphasizing the former at the expense of the latter can be defined as green marketing myopia 5 the marketing discipline has long argued that innovation must consider an intimate understanding of the customer 2 and a close look at green marketing practices over time reveals that green products must be positioned on a consumer value sought by targeted consumers 5 as such successful green products are able to appeal to mainstream consumers or lucrative market niches and frequently command price premiums by offering non-green consumer value such as convenience and performance when consumers are convinced of the desirable non-green benefits of environmental products they are more inclined to adopt them aside from offering environmental benefits that do not meet consumer preferences green marketing myopia can also occur when green products fail to provide credible substantive environmental benefits 6 towards sustainabilityedit sustainability marketing myopiaedit sustainability marketing aims at marketing sustainable products and services which satisfy customer needs and significantly improve the social and environmental performance along the whole life cycle 7 while increasing customer value and achieving the companys objectives in turns sustainability marketing myopia is an exaggerated focus on the socio-ecological attributes of the product over the core consumer values a distortion of the marketing process which is likely to lead to the product failing on the market or remaining confined in a small alternative niche 8 just as an excessive focus on product attributes generates marketing myopia and just as a single-minded focus on customers results in new marketing myopia in both green and sustainability marketing an unbalanced strategy neglecting one aspect namely product attributes is detrimental to the effectiveness of the marketing process however it is important to note that sustainability marketing myopia differs from green marketing myopia in that the former follows a broader approach to the marketing myopia issue taking into account the social attributes of a product as well as the environmental ones at the same time sustainability marketing myopia encompasses sustainable services and product-related services 9 not products alone avoiding sustainability marketing myopiaedit generally sustainability marketing myopia can be avoided in two ways by identifying and stressing the inherent consumers values efficiency and cost-effectiveness health and safety convenience symbolism and status of the socio-ecological features of the product in other words companies should highlight the personal customer benefits stemming from the socio-ecological features of the product by aligning socio-ecological attributes with core benefits of the product to create motive alliances 10 core benefits of the product can comprise functionality performance design durability taste freshness uniqueness aesthetics fashion motive alliances are the connections of such core benefits with the relevant socio-ecological attributes embedded in the product an operation also known as bundling 11 ottman et al 12 provides examples of successful marketing communications based on the highlighting of inherent consumers values of the socio-ecological features of products and on bundling the only thing our washer will shrink is your water bill - asko did you know that between 80

fueled by innovative technology - lexus rx400h hybrid sports utility vehicle besides striking a right balance of focus between product attributes and consumers benefits sustainability marketers should also avoid employing unsubstantive claims about the socio-environmental benefits of their products 13 this particular form of marketing myopia is best avoided by building an image of credibility for the brand through effective sustainability communication so that consumers can easily associate their products with sound socio-environmental performances 14 case studiesedit myopia of sustainable servicesedit electrolux washing machinesedit according to the authors of natural capitalism product dematerialisation is one of the prerequisites for a more sustainable business model in order to become more sustainable the future economy will transform from sale of goods to the sale of services 15 belz and peattie also stress the role of services as a part of sustainable solution talking of product-related use-oriented and result-oriented services product-related services are offered additionally and they optimize the product use eg automobile companies offering courses on a more ecological and safe driving manner in the case of use-oriented services a service and not a product is sold to the consumer eg car-sharing as for result-oriented services consumers neither own nor operate a product e g public transportation with consumers only enjoying the outcome of the product the transportation services 16 product dematerialisation is too at risk of incurring in sustainability marketing myopia in 1999 electrolux piloted an use-oriented sustainable pay-per-wash service in sweden failing to succeed because of a myopic marketing approach new energy and water efficient washing machines were distributed by electrolux among consumers electrolux supplied customers with maintenance services through a central database via the internet and took care of the disposal and upgrading of the machines consumers did not pay for the machines themselves they were only charged with a small installation fee at the beginning and through a pay-per-wash charging system  10 swedish kronor about 1  per wash however an excessive emphasis on the green component in the marketing of this service achieved at the expenses of other consumer benefits and values failed to convince the consumers 17 according to a ottmann et al not only environmental but also other inherent consumer values should have been better marketed by electrolux convenience of pay-per-wash including easy trade-ins for upgrades free service and saved money of a new washing machine in addition the sustainable service might have been successful if pay-per-wash convenience would have been bundled with more desirable features 15 myopia of sustainable productsedit fairtrade coffeeedit the initial idea of introducing the fairtrade coffee certification was to abolish poverty among coffee farmers and their workers by supporting better working conditions and enabling growers to compete in the global market 18 for this reason fairtrade coffee started to be acquired directly from the farmers for a higher price than standard coffee a minimum price for coffee is guaranteed and if the market prices outreach the minimum growers receive a premium 19 in compliance with rising consumers demand for environmentally and social beneficial products the fairtrade certification appears to be an evident indicator products marked with the label have to meet standards ensuring that strict social and environmental measures are taken 18 the first generation of fairtrade coffee suffered from sustainability marketing myopia first due to the exaggerated focus on the socio-ecological aspects the quality and the taste of the coffee were put into the background most coffee farmers used to sell their coffee to both fairtrade and open markets as the price in the open market is entirely defined by quality farmers sold their better quality beans in that market and then squandered their poorer beans into the fairtrade market where they were nonetheless ensured a good price furthermore the certainty that fairtrade buyers would mix supplies together discouraged farmers to improve the quality of their own beans without having any financial reward for that 20 furthermore fairtrade coffee failed to guarantee the social and environmental benefits to the consumer as covenant 21 moreover fairtrade has been accused of misleading consumers about its ability to monitor production practices with particular regards to salary conditions of temporary workers 22 the first generation fairtrade coffee with a worse quality and bitter taste failed to satisfy all customers needs and supposedly to improve the social performance along the whole life cycle of the product green buildingsedit as well as electrolux and fairtrade coffee suppliers the producers of green buildings in western europe suffered from sustainability marketing myopia in the experimental stages of energy-efficient houses companies focussed on the energy-efficient attributes of the houses at the expenses of cost-effectiveness and affordability marketing their products on the basis of intergenerational equity ecology and energy-savings 23 in addition further inherent consumer values as comfort and design were also ignored at these early stages 24 nevertheless since the beginning of the twenty-first century marketers from construction companies have improved their strategies successful sustainability marketing concepts have been progressively adopted including motive alliances and the use of a new marketing mix based on so-called 4 cs consumer solution consumer cost communication and convenience 25 23 this new approach has fostered a rise in the market share of energy-efficient houses 24 81fÃ¼nf holzbau is an example of such a company applying successful marketing strategies it is a fast expanding german company which focuses on energy-efficient wooden houses conventional criteria as high-quality levels and comfort are aligned with sustainable components in the company marketing communication healthy indoor environment created by using natural woods energy savings and security from future oil price rises are among the arguments used 23 their interactive online toolkit energy comfort house allows to easily calculate the life cycle cost and savings compared to conventional houses and acts therefore as a credibility tool 23 in order to offer the broadest choice in terms of consumer solutions different house models are provided to various customer target groups according to their environmental consciousness and affordability notesedit referencesedit
