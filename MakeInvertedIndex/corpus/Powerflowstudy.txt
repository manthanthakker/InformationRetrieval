power-flow study in power engineering the power-flow study or load-flow study is a numerical analysis of the flow of electric power in an interconnected system a power-flow study usually uses simplified notation such as a one-line diagram and per-unit system and focuses on various aspects of ac power parameters such as voltages voltage angles real power and reactive power it analyzes the power systems in normal steady-state operation power-flow or load-flow studies are important for planning future expansion of power systems as well as in determining the best operation of existing systems the principal information obtained from the power-flow study is the magnitude and phase angle of the voltage at each bus and the real and reactive power flowing in each line commercial power systems are usually too complex to allow for hand solution of the power flow special purpose network analyzers were built between 1929 and the early 1960s to provide laboratory-scale physical models of power systems large-scale digital computers replaced the analog methods with numerical solutions in addition to a power-flow study computer programs perform related calculations such as short-circuit fault analysis stability studies transient  steady-state unit commitment and economic dispatch 1 in particular some programs use linear programming to find the optimal power flow the conditions which give the lowest cost per kilowatt hour delivered a load flow study is especially valuable for a system with multiple load centers such as a refinery complex the power flow study is an analysis of the systems capability to adequately supply the connected load the total system losses as well as individual line losses also are tabulated transformer tap positions are selected to ensure the correct voltage at critical locations such as motor control centers performing a load flow study on an existing system provides insight and recommendations as to the system operation and optimization of control settings to obtain maximum capacity while minimizing the operating costs the results of such an analysis are in terms of active power reactive power magnitude and phase angle furthermore power-flow computations are crucial for optimal operations of groups of generating units the open energy modelling initiative promotes open source load-flow models and other types of energy system models  contents 1 model 2 power-flow problem formulation 3 newtonraphson solution method 4 other power-flow methods 5 references  modeledit an alternating current power-flow model is a model used in electrical engineering to analyze power grids it provides a nonlinear system which describes the energy flow through each transmission line the problem is non-linear because the power flow into load impedances is a function of the square of the applied voltages due to nonlinearity in many cases the analysis of large network via ac power-flow model is not feasible and a linear but less accurate dc power-flow model is used instead usually analysis of a three-phase system is simplified by assuming balanced loading of all three phases steady-state operation is assumed with no transient changes in power flow or voltage due to load or generation changes the system frequency is also assumed to be constant a further simplification is to use the per-unit system to represent all voltages power flows and impedances scaling the actual target system values to some convenient base a system one-line diagram is the basis to build a mathematical model of the generators loads buses and transmission lines of the system and their electrical impedances and ratings power-flow problem formulationedit the goal of a power-flow study is to obtain complete voltages angle and magnitude information for each bus in a power system for specified load and generator real power and voltage conditions 2 once this information is known real and reactive power flow on each branch as well as generator reactive power output can be analytically determined due to the nonlinear nature of this problem numerical methods are employed to obtain a solution that is within an acceptable tolerance the solution to the power-flow problem begins with identifying the known and unknown variables in the system the known and unknown variables are dependent on the type of bus a bus without any generators connected to it is called a load bus with one exception a bus with at least one generator connected to it is called a generator bus the exception is one arbitrarily-selected bus that has a generator this bus is referred to as the slack bus in the power-flow problem it is assumed that the real power pd and reactive power qd at each load bus are known for this reason load buses are also known as pq buses for generator buses it is assumed that the real power generated pg and the voltage magnitude v is known for the slack bus it is assumed that the voltage magnitude v and voltage phase θ are known therefore for each load bus both the voltage magnitude and angle are unknown and must be solved for for each generator bus the voltage angle must be solved for there are no variables that must be solved for the slack bus in a system with n buses and r generators there are then 2  n  1    r  1  displaystyle 2n-1-r-1 unknowns in order to solve for the 2  n  1    r  1  displaystyle 2n-1-r-1 unknowns there must be 2  n  1    r  1  displaystyle 2n-1-r-1 equations that do not introduce any new unknown variables the possible equations to use are power balance equations which can be written for real and reactive power for each bus the real power balance equation is where p i displaystyle pi is the net power injected at bus i g i k displaystyle gik is the real part of the element in the bus admittance matrix ybus corresponding to the ith row and kth column b i k displaystyle bik is the imaginary part of the element in the ybus corresponding to the ith row and kth column and θ i k displaystyle theta ik is the difference in voltage angle between the ith and kth buses  θ i k  δ i  δ k displaystyle theta ikdelta i-delta k  the reactive power balance equation is where q i displaystyle qi is the net reactive power injected at bus i equations included are the real and reactive power balance equations for each load bus and the real power balance equation for each generator bus only the real power balance equation is written for a generator bus because the net reactive power injected is assumed to be unknown and therefore including the reactive power balance equation would result in an additional unknown variable for similar reasons there are no equations written for the slack bus in many transmission systems the voltage angles θ i k displaystyle theta ik are usually relatively small there is thus a strong coupling between real power and voltage angle and between reactive power and voltage magnitude while the coupling between real power and voltage magnitude as well as reactive power and voltage angle is weak as a result real power is usually transmitted from the bus with higher voltage angle to the bus with lower voltage angle and reactive power is usually transmitted from the bus with higher voltage magnitude to the bus with lower voltage magnitude however this approximation does not hold when the voltage angle is very large 3 newtonraphson solution methodedit there are several different methods of solving the resulting nonlinear system of equations the most popular is known as the newtonraphson method this method begins with initial guesses of all unknown variables voltage magnitude and angles at load buses and voltage angles at generator buses next a taylor series is written with the higher order terms ignored for each of the power balance equations included in the system of equations  the result is a linear system of equations that can be expressed as where δ p displaystyle delta p and δ q displaystyle delta q are called the mismatch equations δ q i   q i   k  1 n  v i   v k   g i k sin  θ i k  b i k cos  θ i k  displaystyle delta qi-qisum k=1nvivkgiksin theta ik-bikcos theta ik and j displaystyle j is a matrix of partial derivatives known as a jacobian j    δ p  θ  δ p   v   δ q  θ  δ q   v   displaystyle jbeginbmatrixdfrac partial delta ppartial theta dfrac partial delta ppartial vdfrac partial delta qpartial theta dfrac partial delta qpartial vendbmatrix  the linearized system of equations is solved to determine the next guess m  1 of voltage magnitude and angles based on the process continues until a stopping condition is met a common stopping condition is to terminate if the norm of the mismatch equations is below a specified tolerance a rough outline of solution of the power-flow problem is other power-flow methodsedit gaussseidel method this is the earliest devised method it shows slower rates of convergence compared to other iterative methods but it uses very little memory and does not need to solve a matrix system fast-decoupled-load-flow method is a variation on newton-raphson that exploits the approximate decoupling of active and reactive flows in well-behaved power networks and additionally fixes the value of the jacobian during the iteration in order to avoid costly matrix decompositions also referred to as fixed-slope decoupled nr within the algorithm the jacobian matrix gets inverted only once and there are three assumptions firstly the conductance between the buses is zero secondly the magnitude of the bus voltage is one per unit thirdly the sine of phases between buses is zero fast decoupled load flow can return the answer within seconds whereas the newton raphson method takes much longer this is useful for real-time management of power grids holomorphic embedding load flow method a recently developed method based on advanced techniques of complex analysis it is direct and guarantees the calculation of the correct operative branch out of the multiple solutions present in the power flow equations referencesedit
