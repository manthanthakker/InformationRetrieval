battle with herbert c brown of purdue over the existence of so-called nonclassical carbocations  such as the norbornyl cation which can be depicted as cationic character delocalized over several bonds in recent yearswhen his research has shifted from hydrocarbons and their transformation into fuel to the methanol economy he has joined with robert zubrin anne korin and james woolsey in promoting a flexible-fuel mandate initiative 13 14 15 awards and honoursedit 1970 acs henry morley medalcitation needed 1989 california scientist of the year in 1989citation needed 1993 chemical pioneer award
