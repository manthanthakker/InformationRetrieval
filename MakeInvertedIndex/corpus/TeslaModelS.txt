motors and introduced in june 2012 10 it scored a perfect 5.0 nhtsa automobile safety rating as well as being the third fastest accelerating production car ever produced and the fastest accelerating car currently in production 11 the united states environmental protection agency epa official range for the 2012 model s performance model equipped with an 85kwh  310mj battery pack is 265 miles  426km higher than any other electric car at the time 12 13 14 epa rates its energy consumption at 237.5watt-hoursperkilometer  38kwh/100mi or 24kwh/100km for a combined fuel economy of 89 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent  2.64l/100km or 107mpg-imp 12 15 the model s became the first electric car to top the monthly new car sales ranking in any country twice leading in norway in september and again in december 2013 16 17 18 19 and also in denmark in december 2015 20 global model s sales passed the 100,000 unit milestone in december 2015 21 and almost 145,500 units have been sold worldwide as of september 2016update 22 23 the model s ranked as the worlds best selling plug-in electric vehicle in 2015 up from second best in 2014 24 25 and continued to lead global plug-in car sales during the first nine months of 2016 26 the model s also ranked as the top selling plug-in electric car in the us in 2015 27 28 as of december 2015update the leading markets were the united states with a 60 share of global sales and norway with 9.4 other leading country markets are china the netherlands canada denmark germany and switzerland 24 as of june 2016update the model s ranked as the worlds second best selling plug-in electric car in history after the nissan leaf 29 the tesla model s won awards including the 2013 world green car of the year 2013 motor trend car of the year automobile magazines 2013 car of the year time magazine best 25 inventions of the year 2012 award and consumer reports top-scoring car in its road testing in 2015 car and driver named the model s the car of the century 30 after declining to recommend the model s in 2015 due to reliability issues one year later consumer reports added the car to the magazines recommended list 31 32 in 2016 tesla updated the design of the model s which now looks more like the model x the 60 60d 70 70d 75 75d and 90d versions are available 70 and 70d model s owners have the option to unlock the 75 kwh capacity via a software update adding up to 19 miles  31km per charge 33 the 60 and 60d reintroduced in june 2016 owners have a us$9,000 anytime option to unlock the full 75 kwh capacity via a software update 34 in august 2016 tesla introduced the p100d to be the new top-level model the p100d model has a 100kwh battery a 0–60mph  0–97kmh time of 2.5 seconds and over 300 miles  485km of epa rated range 35

mazda north american operations 36 the car was codenamed whitestar during research and preliminary development 1 2 3 the model s was announced in a press release on june 30 2008 37 38 the prototype vehicle was displayed at a press conference on march 26 2009 39 in february 2008 it was reported that tesla motors was planning to offer a range-extended version of its model s this version would have included a gasoline engine to extend the driving range of the vehicle 40 but it was removed in later revisions at the goinggreen conference in september 2008 teslas ceo elon musk announced that tesla was developing only electric cars 41 construction of an assembly factory in albuquerque new mexico a central location for shipping was supposed to begin in april 2007 but was cancelled 42 a factory to be built in san jose california was also announced 43 44 45 in may 2010 tesla announced it would produce the model s at the former nummi assembly plant in fremont california 46 now known as the tesla factory this third plan was implemented in june 2015 three years after the model s introduction and with almost 75,000 model s sedans delivered worldwide tesla announced that model s owners have accumulated over 1 billion electric miles  1.6 billion km traveled and saved more than half a million tons of co2 47 48 the tesla model s is the first plug-in electric vehicle to reach that milestone in october 2014 general motors reported that volt owners had accumulated a total of 629 million all-electric miles over 1 billion kilometers out of a total of 1 billion miles  1.6 billion km traveled while nissan reported in december 2014 that leaf owners had traveled 625 million miles  1 billion kilometers 48 tesla also reported that 68 of model s travel took place in north america 25 in europe and 7 in asia-pacific 48 global model s sales passed the 100,000 unit milestone in december 2015 21 in 2016 a racing series called the electric gt world series was promoted in preparation for a 2017 racing season using the p85 as a race car on certain traditional tracks the first season is planned to have 20 cars in 10 teams 49 in april 2016 a refresh model s was introduced the front fascia has with a similar design as the model x and also adaptive led headlights were introduced also the improved model s has a hepa air filtration system that removes at least 99.97 of particulate exhaust pollution and all allergens bacteria and other contaminants from cabin air the standard charger was upgraded from 40 to 48 amps in order to enable faster charging when connected to higher-amp outlets two new interior choices were added figured ash wood and dark ash wood these improvements were accompanied by a us$1,500 price increase in the base model 50 productionedit tesla manufactures the model s at the 5.4 million square foot 51 tesla factory in fremont california for the european market tesla assembles and distributes from its european distribution center in tilburg the netherlands 52 cars are built and tested in fremont california the battery pack the electric motor and parts are disassembled and shipped separately to tilburg where the cars are reassembled 53 the center occupies a 203,000sqft  18,900m2 industrial building that also serves as a workshop and spare parts warehouse tesla expects the model s to pay back the energy that went into producing the car in fewer than 10,000 miles  16,000km 54 the first ten customers received their cars at the fremont factory on june 22 2012 at the official launch 55 production grew from 15–20 cars completedweek in august 2012 55 to about 1,000 cars per week in 2015 56 in october 2015 tesla motors announced the company is negotiating with the chinese government on producing its electric cars domestically local production has the potential to reduce the sales prices of tesla models by a third 57 a model s starts at us$71,500 in the us while in china pricing starts at cn¥673,000 about us$106,000 after duties and other taxes 58 elon musk clarified that production will remain in the us but if theres sufficient local demand for the tesla model 3 in china a factory could be built in the country as soon as a year after the launch of the new model production in europe will also depend on the regions demand for the model 3 59 designedit the model s exists in several versions differing in energy capacity battery size power motor size and equipment it is classified as a fullsize luxury car in the usa or as a large car 60  120 cu ft or more or luxury sedan 61 by the epa the euro car segment classification is s-segment sports car 62 63 or oberklasse in germany 64 powertrainedit the 2012 tesla model s performance model has a three phase four pole ac induction 416hp  310kw and 443ftlb  600nm rear-mounted electric motor with copper rotor 65 the base model uses a 362hp  270kw and 325ftlb  440nm motor the company claimed a drag coefficient of cd=0.24 66 lower than any car when released  67 independent measurement by car and driver in may 2014 bore out teslas claim by exactly confirming a drag coefficient of cd=0.24 68 the rear axle has a traditional open differential models with dual motors also have an open differential on the front axles as well the front and rear axles have no mechanical linkage  with dual motors the power distribution among them is controlled electronically 69 the model s p90d has a top speed of 155mph  249kmh and it accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour  0 to 97kmh in 2.8 seconds despite the lower total motor power in part due to the improved traction of the all-wheel drive powertrain the model s p85d a dual motor all-wheel drive vehicle has a governed top speed of 155mph  249kmh 70 and it accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour  0 to 97kmh in 3.2 seconds tested to 3.1 seconds under insane mode with 1g of acceleration 70 71 new p85ds have an optional ludicrous mode hardware package available with the 90 kwh battery upgrade thus becoming a p90d that improves the 0 to 60 miles per hour  0 to 97kmh acceleration to 2.8 seconds and 1.1g 72 73 74 tesla initially reported the total output in the p85d as the arithmetic addition of the maximum power of the individual electric motors at 691hp  515kw but later reported it as 463hp  345kw because the two motors do not give their maximum power at the same time 75 the powertrain also provides regenerative braking power of more than 60kw which reduces both energy consumption and improves brake lifetime owners reported many powertrain issues from 2012 improving significantly over the years 76 in july 2015 tesla announced its goal to make the model s powertrain last for one million miles 77 dual-motor all-wheel-drive versionsedit on october 9 2014 tesla announced the introduction of all wheel drive awd versions of the model ss 60 85 and p85 models designated by a d at the end of the model number 78 79 80 on april 8 2015 tesla introduced the model s 70d as its new us$75,000 entry-level car with all-wheel drive and an improved range of 240 miles  385km the 70d replaced the 60 and 60d in the model s lineup with the latter two models no longer being available for purchase the p85 option was also dropped 81 82 in the 85d the rear drive unit is replaced by a smaller one to save cost and weight while a second motor of similar size is added to the front wheels this results in an awd car with comparable power and acceleration to the rwd version while keeping the price increase to us$5,000 additionally the 85d reports a 2  5-mile range increase and 11 increase in top speed over the 85 83 presumably due to incremental improvements in hardware and software in the p85d the high-power rear drive unit is retained while a new front drive motor boosts the total power by about 50 this results in a significant increase in acceleration and top speed the 85kwh version rose from us$81,070 to us$86,070 while the p85 now the p85d jumped from us$94,570 to us$105,670 deliveries of the p85d started in december 2014 with the 85d models starting in february 2015 and the 70d models starting in april 2015 79 on june 9 2016 tesla reintroduced the 60 and 60d which has a 75kwh battery locked out to 60kwh 84 but upgradable by software as is the autopilot option the spring refresh of 2016 also offers the bioweapon defense mode airfilter first offered on the model x 85 on august 23 2016 tesla introduced the model s p100d with ludicrous mode as its new us$134,500 top-level car with all-wheel drive and an improved epa estimated range of 315 miles  505km 35 this version of the model s is notable for being the first electric vehicle to have a us epa estimated range greater than 300 miles  485km and for being the fastest accelerating vehicle currently in production with a 0–60mph  0–97kmh time of 2.5 seconds when optioned with ludicrous mode 86 87 batteryedit in 2012 the epa range for the 60kwh battery pack model was 208mi  335km 88 and the 85kwh battery was 265 miles  426km 12 89 according to musk the model s has a battery with twice the energy density of that on the nissan leaf but the difference in range is more than double this is also due to other factors such as drag coefficient weight engine efficiency and rolling resistance 90 musk stated that driving at 65mph  105kmh under normal conditions gives a reasonable range of 250 miles  400km 91 the energy-saving sleep state powers off the display and other vehicle electronics after the car goes to sleep this increases the time it takes the touchscreen and instrument panel to become usable this mode can decrease the loss of the cars range when not being used  2.3mi 3.7km per day as of 2013update 92 the 85kwh battery pack weighs 1,200lb  540kg 93bettersourceneeded and contains 7,104 lithium-ion battery cells in 16 modules 94 wired in series  14 in the flat section and two stacked on the front 95 each module contains 6 groups 96 of 74 cells 97 wired in parallel the 6 groups are then wired in series within the module 97 98 99 100 as of june 2012update the battery pack used modified panasonic cells with nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathodes 4 each cell was of the 18650 form factor ie an 18mm diameter 65mm height cylinder similar to the panasonic ncr18650b cell that has an energy density of 265whkg 101 analysts estimate battery cost to be around 21–22 of the car cost 102 list price for a replacement battery was us$44,000 in february 2015 103 the battery is guaranteed for eight years or 125,000 miles  200,000km in metric countries for the base model with the 60kwh battery pack the 85kwh battery pack is guaranteed for eight years and unlimited miles 104 105 a poll among drivers indicate that accumulated battery loss steadies around 5 after 30,000 miles  50,000km 106 76 decreasing further about 1 per additional 30,000 miles unlike nissan tesla does not specify a limit for battery loss but some early battery packs have been replaced 103 107 a separate battery replacement guarantee takes effect after the eighth year at a cost of us$10,000 for the 60kwh battery and us$12,000 for the 85kwh battery 108 in 2013 tesla canceled a 40kwh version of the car due to lack of demand stating that only 4 of pre-orders were for the 40kwh battery option customers who ordered this option instead received the 60kwh pack with charge software-limited to 40kwh  139 miles 224km 109 it has the improved acceleration and top speed of the bigger pack and can be upgraded to use the full 60kwh for us$11,000 110 on april 8 2015 tesla motors discontinued the model s 60 and replaced the base model with the model s 70 111 in 2015 tesla introduced a 70kwh battery to replace the existing 60kwh batteries and base 60kwh model s vehicles as the 60 was low margin and not sufficiently welcomed by customers 112 113 all 70kwh cars can be had with rear-wheel drive or all wheel drive 114 the 60 was re-introduced in 2016 as a software-limited 75 upgradable to 75 in july 2015 tesla introduced its 70 90 90d and p90d variants along with a ludicrous mode for the performance model the p90d combines a front axle power of 259 horsepower  193kw and rear axle power of 503 horsepower  375kw to a total of 762 horsepower  568kw for a 0–60mph time of 2.8 sec the acceleration of the p90d can reach 1.1g described by tesla as faster than falling 77 the ludicrous mode costs us$10,000 for p90d but was discounted to us$5,000 plus labor for p85d owners until january 2016 115 in july 2015 tesla introduced its 90 and p90d a range upgrade of the 85 variants with a 90kwh battery and explained the 6 energy increase with improved cell chemistry 77 and with the introduction of silicon into the graphite cell anode 116 tesla additionally announced its expectation of an annual improvement in battery capacity of about 5 tesla also explained that apart from the p90d the model s has its main battery conductor protected by a fuse rated for 1,300a and that this rating is somewhat conservative given the uncertainty of the exact conditions under which a fuse melts to reduce this uncertainty tesla has for the p90d introduced inconel battery contactors 117 and an electronically controlled pyro-activated fuse which monitors the current at the millisecond level cuts the power with extreme precision and certainty and has a rating of 1,500a 77 in february 2016 the 85 kwh battery option was discontinued in countries including the us australia and canada 119 in march 2016 media reported that a firmware version distributed for the tesla model s has support for a yet to come p100d variant 120 this battery is more complicated to make than the 90 version 121 the p100d was released in august 2016 35 practicality and livabilityedit the model s is notable for being designed solely with an electric powertrain in mind unlike other vehicles where the manufacturer has simply swapped out or supplanted an internal combustion engine with an electric motor 122 as a result the model s is able to offer unique features such as a front trunk frunk in addition to a spacious rear trunk with a capacity of 894 liters and a greatly enlarged front crumple zone compared to the typical combustion engine powered vehicle 86 to enhance livability tesla has developed a network of fast-charging supercharger stations that allow the driver to quickly and easily top-up the charge on their model s 86 this supercharger network has rapidly expanded in europe across the united states and other countries where the there is significant demand and as of september 2016update the network has been established in most american states thus making cross-country and long distance trips in an electric vehicle feasible and greatly alleviating fears of range anxiety 86 see the supercharger section below for further information researchers from the university of california davis conducted a study to identify the factors influencing the decision to adopt high-end battery electric vehicles bev such as the tesla model s as these vehicles are remarkably different from mainstream bevs the 2016 study found that environmental performance and technological motivations are reasons for adoption the new technology brings a new segment of buyers into the market and financial purchase incentives are not important in the consumers decision to adopt a high-end bev 123 specificationsedit  60  60d 386kw energy consumptionedit under its five-cycle testing protocol the us environmental protection agency epa rated the 85kwh model s model with a combined fuel economy equivalent of 89mpge  2.64l/100km with an equivalent 88mpg-us  2.7l/100km 106mpg-imp in city driving and 90mpg-us  2.6l/100km 110mpg-imp on highways 12 the following table shows the epas official ratings for fuel economy in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpge and epas estimated out-of-pocket fuel costs for the variants of the model s rated as of 30 december 2015update and as displayed in the monroney label battery placementedit in contrast to most other battery electric vehicles including the roadster the battery pack of the model s forms the floor of the vehicle between the axles providing the vehicle with several advantages most notably since the battery pack is the single heaviest component of the vehicle the model s has a center of gravity height of only 18 inches  46cm 93 132 about the same as a lotus elise 133 helping it to achieve a lateral acceleration of 0.9g 134 and good protection against rollover 135 136 secondly the absence of a heavy engine between the front or rear axle allows the bulk of the mass to be centralized between the axles lowering rotational inertia allowing it to turn more quickly for its weight thirdly the placement of the battery pack increases the rigidity of the passenger compartment improving the passive safety of the vehicle 137 fourth placing the battery pack under the vehicle makes it possible to remove or replace the entire unit in 90 seconds 138 either for maintenance or for

up to 22kw providing up to 70 miles  110km of range per hour of charge the tesla wall connector is expected to be available in the second quarter of 2016 141 suspensionedit the model s has independent coil spring suspension on all four wheels front double wishbone virtual steer axis control arm and rear independent multilink 65 as an extra-cost option the car is available with self-leveling height-adjustable air suspension this is accomplished via adjustable bilstein shock absorbers controlled by the driver the car is meant to lower itself at highway speed and raise itself to traverse steep driveways and rough terrain despite the low 6-inch ground clearance and rather long 116-inch wheelbase 142 because in the tesla electronic systems can be upgraded by over-the-air download rather than recall the suspension system has been changed retroactively on several occasions during the 2013 fire investigation nhtsa asked tesla to disable the cars ability to lower itself at speed on the theory that a ground clearance below 6 inches might cause the batteries underneath the car to contact road debris 143 in september 2014 tesla upgraded the height adjustment feature for model s cars equipped with air suspension to remember locations that require higher clearance such as those with potholes and steep driveways and automatically adjusts to avoid them 144 autopilotedit beginning in late september 2014 all new model s vehicles come equipped with a camera supplied by mobileye mounted at the top of the windshield forward looking radar supplied by bosch 145 146 in the lower grill and ultrasonic acoustic location sensors in the front and rear bumpers that provide a 360-degree buffer zone around the car this equipment allows model s to detect road signs lane markings obstacles and other vehicles in addition to adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning a us$2,500 tech package option will allow this system to enable semi-autonomous drive and parking capabilities 147 148 149 all model s sold since october 2014 have the option to have autopilot which allows limited hands-free driving autopilot-enabled cars receive software updates for the autopilot software wirelessly just as all other model s cars receive general software updates wirelessly according to elon musk the model s was designed to be a computer on wheels we really designed the model s to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels tesla is a software company as much as it is a hardware company a huge part of what tesla is is a silicon valley software company we view this the same as updating your phone or your laptop 151 full autonomy is really a software limitation the hardware exists to create full autonomy so its really about developing advanced narrow ai for the car to operate on 152 153 teslas autonomous driving features are ahead of production cars and its autopilot can be classified as somewhere between levels 2 and 3 under the us department of transportations national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa five levels of vehicle automation at this level the car can act autonomously but requires the full attention of the driver who must be prepared to take control at a moments notice 154 155 156 autopilot is suitable only on limited-access highways and sometimes it will fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself in urban driving the system will not read traffic signals or obey stop signs the system also does not detect pedestrians or cyclists 157 starting october 2016 all tesla cars are built with the necessary hardware to allow full self-driving capability at a safety level sae level 5 158 the system will operate in shadow mode processing without taking action and send data back to tesla to improve its abilities until the software is ready for deployment via over-the-air upgrades 159 tesla motors says it expects to enable full self-driving by the end of 2017 after proper testing 158 fatal accidentedit the first known fatal accident involving a tesla model s when the car was in autopilot mode took place in williston florida on 7 may 2016 the driver was killed in a crash with a large 18-wheel tractor-trailer by late june 2016 the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the florida highway patrol according to the nhtsa preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway and the car failed to apply the brakes the car continued to travel after passing under the trucks trailer 160 161 162 the nhtsas preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash which involves a population of an estimated 25,000 model s cars 163 on 8 july 2016 the nhtsa requested tesla motors to hand over to the agency detailed information about the design operation and testing of its autopilot technology the agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to autopilot since its introduction and teslas planned updates scheduled for the next four months 164 according to tesla neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky so the brake was not applied the car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the model s tesla also stated that this was teslas first known autopilot death in over 130 million miles  208 million km driven by its customers where autopilot was activated according to tesla there is a fatality every 94 million miles  150 million km among all type of vehicles in the us 160 161 165 some statisticians say that teslas use of statistics is meaningless due to the relatively small total distance traveled by tesla cars and the different driving conditions of the two data sets being compared it is estimated that billions of miles will need to be traveled before a statistically significant comparison can be made researchers say that tesla and others need to release more data on the limitations and performance of automated driving systems if self-driving cars are to become safe and understood enough for mass market use 166 instrument paneledit the instrument panel is a 12.3-inch  31cm liquid-crystal display electronic instrument cluster that indicates speed power usage charge level estimated range and active gear as well as nav directions driven by garmin the gearbox can be set to drive neutral reverse and park the infotainment control touchscreen is a 17-inch  43cm multi-touch panel divided into four areas a top line displays status symbols and provides shortcuts to charging homelink driver profiles vehicle information software version and the vehicle identification number and bluetooth the second line provides access to several apps including media nav driven by google maps and thus is separate from the nav on instrument panel energy web camera and phone the central main viewing area displays the two active apps subdivided into upper and lower areas most apps can be expanded to take up the entire area at the bottom is access to various controls and settings for the vehicle such as doors locks and lights as well as temperature controls and a secondary volume control the instrument cluster and the infotainment panel are driven by separate nvidia tegra 3 3d visual computing modules 167 168 tesla was the first company to ship this technology audi later delivered this technology in its 2013 model year in europe and in north america in 2014 169 the tegra system on a chip soc integrates eight specialized processors including a multi-core arm cpu a gpu and dedicated audio video and image processors nvidia claimed that it consumes 2 of the energy of a typical cpu 170 the navigation system uses gps and a mix of garmin and google maps route guidance the map display on the 17-inch screen requires a constant internet connection so navigation is limited in areas without mobile network coverage the nav on the instrument panel is loaded on the car and does not need internet access to function 171 update 6.2 features automatic nav guidance to charging stations if range is insufficient 172 enthusiasts have developed the open vehicle monitoring system ovms which allows the owner to remotely observe a variety of different vehicle operating parameters such as battery state of charge typically using a smartphone some switchgear used are mercedes parts such as window switches cruise control lever and drive selector according to elon musk the model s runs on the open-source linux operating system 173 in 2014 autoblog reported that tesla models s owners had determined via the cars combined diagnostics and ethernet port that a ubuntu system controlling the central touchscreen is connected to the cars internal ethernet 174 the same users determined that another ubuntu system controlling the dashboardnavigation screen also is connected to the internal network together with a third computer of unknown type with an unknown function 175 featuresedit all versions of the model s have the same body and normally seat five passengers an optional folding third row for us$2,500 becomes a rear-facing two-place child seat the option includes a stronger rear bumper 132 136 each third row seat has a racing-style five-point harness for passengers over 37in  0.94m tall and weighing between 35 to 77lb  16 to 35kg cargo space is available under the front hood which tesla called a frunk a portmanteau of front trunk the optional third row gives the greatest passenger capacity of any electric vehicle 176 in october 2014 the upgraded model s p85d d for dual was introduced 177 the upgraded version features two electric motors one driving the rear wheels as in prior versions and one driving the front wheels safety features are enhanced also for example with partial auto-pilot functions the dual motor version will be available also for the basic 85 kwh versions for around us$4,000 more in price the rear wheel drive version of the p85 was removed and the dual motor option is not available for the 60 kwh version 81 the 2015 model year update introduced electromechanical brakes 178 in 2016 the 85kwh and later 90kwh battery was discontinued from all markets a glass roof with no horizontal roof bar between the b-pillars was introduced in late 2016 179 vehicle warranty and maintenanceedit the model s is covered by a 4-year 50,000mi  80,000km limited warranty 180 that includes all standard equipment the transmission and the complete powertrain excluding tires 181 the warranty can be extended an additional 4 years or 50,000 miles  80,000km beyond the original terms for us$4,000 181 warranty coverage includes a complementary loaner cara performance 85 or tesla roadsterwhen service is required 182 in april 2013 tesla announced that a previously mandatory us$600 annual vehicle inspection and maintenance fee would be made optional and would not be required to maintain warranty coverage 182 if chosen the fee covers a complete inspection tire alignment new brake pads hardware upgrades and miscellaneous other maintenance items as needed the battery and drive unit are covered for eight years or 125,000 miles  200,000km in metric countries for the 60kwh base model or eight years and unlimited distance for all 70 and 85kwh models 104 183 the unconditional battery warranty covers everything except deliberate damage even including user error 184 however loss of battery capacity over time or usage is not covered under warrantyclarification needed 183 185 environmental footprintedit in february 2014 the automotive science group asg published the result of a study conducted to assess the life-cycle of over 1,300 automobiles across nine categories sold in north america the study ranked the model s as the best environmental performer in the 2014 full-size cars category 186 based on the assessment of life-cycle environmental footprint the study concluded that the increased environmental impacts of manufacturing the vehicle are more than offset with increased environmental performance during operation for the assessment the study used the average electricity mix of the us grid in 2014 the nissan leaf had the smallest life-cycle environmental footprint of any model year 2014 automobile available in the north american market 187 in 2015 the union of concerned scientists found that in the us regions where the model s is popular the 68 higher manufacturing emissions are offset within a few years of average driving during their life-cycle evs emit about half the amount of comparable fossil cars 188 189 according to an ibm researcher this analysis is the best available 190 tesla has worked with toxcokinsbursky in the us since 2008 and umicore in europe 191 to recycle worn out rohs batteries 192 193 which will be performed in gigafactory 1 194 tesla stationsedit in 2012 tesla began building a network of 480-volt charging stations to facilitate long-distance travel in june 2013 tesla announced that existing and future stations would become tesla stations with facilities to support under-two-minute battery pack swaps as of early october 2014 115 stations were operating in the united states 71 in europe and 23 in asia 195 196 the tesla network is usable only by tesla vehicles which are engineered for compatibility the first supercharger corridor opened in october 2012 with six stations placed along routes connecting san francisco lake tahoe los angeles and las vegas 197 198 a second corridor opened in december 2012 connecting washington dc new york city and boston it includes three stations located in highway rest areas in delaware and connecticut 199 the first tesla stations in europe opened in norway in august 2013 200 tesla next focused on germany and the netherlands with plans to cover both countries by mid-2014 switzerland belgium austria denmark and luxembourg were to be covered by the end of 2014 stations were to be within 200mi  320km for about 90 of the population in france england wales and sweden by the end of 2014 201 superchargeredit the supercharger is a proprietary dc rapid-charging station that provides up to 135kw of power giving 85kwh vehicles an additional 180mi  290km of range in about 15–30 minutes older 60kwh may have reduced charge rate 202 in the west coast corridor the superchargerss grid access is assisted by a solar carport system some including a battery of a few hundred kwh 203 provided by solarcity eventually all tesla stations will be assisted by solar power supercharging hardware is now a standard on all vehicles sold by tesla motors the roadster is not compatible 197 198 199 in early november 2013 tesla reported that 90 of its customers had opted for supercharging capability 201 as of april 2016update there are over 620 open superchargers around the world elon musk said at the unveiling of the model 3 that that number would be doubled by the end of 2017 tesla has received criticism about the length of time it has taken them to install chargers on high use corridors of the united states such as i-40 and i-80citation needed tesla built 120kw 204 tesla supercharger stations to allow long distance travel in north america europe asia and australia 205 a supercharger can add up to 125 miles  201km of range in 20 minutes and a full charge in approximately one hour assuming a nearly empty 85 kwh battery 4 140 supercharging hardware is included in the 85kwh 70kwh and 60kwh battery packs in both the 85kwh models and 70kwh models 206 the payment for the car includes supercharging by default but in the 60kwh supercharging was software-disabled and one must pay an extra fee to enable supercharging 104 140 207 208 battery swappingedit tesla designed its model s to allow fast battery swapping which also facilitates vehicle assembly 209 in june 2013 tesla announced their goal to deploy a battery swapping station in tesla stations at a demonstration tesla showed a battery swap operation taking just over 90 seconds about half the time it takes to refill an empty gas tank 210 211 battery swapping was to be deployed along interstate 5 in california to allow travel from san francisco to los angeles these were to be followed by the washington dc to boston corridor each swapping station costs us$500,000 and stocks about 50 batteries the service would be offered for the price of about 15 us gallons  57l 12impgal of gasoline at the current local rate around us$60 to us$80 at june 2013 prices owners can pick up their original battery pack fully charged on the return trip which is included in the swap fee tesla would also offer the option to keep the swapped battery for a fee or to receive the original pack from tesla for a fee pricing has not been determined 210 teslas only battery swap station is located at harris ranch california and was available for pilot testing in late december 2014 212 as of 2015update tesla says they have hundreds of cars in the battery swap program although few owners are interested in using the service 213 in june 2015 tesla said that it was unlikely that more battery swap stations would be added due to lack of demand for battery swaps costing around $60 when supercharging is included free with most models 214 editionsedit tesla allocated the first 1,000 units to its signature and signature performance limited edition configurations equipped with the 85kwh battery pack and priced in the us at us$95,400 and us$105,400 respectively not including any applicable us federal and local government tax credits and

delivery of the 3,000th model s in california representing around 50 of us sales to that date 342 343 during the first quarter of 2013 the model s ranked as the top selling plug-in electric vehicle in the us with about 4,900 units delivered followed by the chevrolet volt with 4,244 units 228 344 345 during 2013 the model s was listed as the least stolen car in the united states with a theft rating of just 0.15 per 1,000 units produced by comparison the us average is 3.51 cars stolen per 1,000 produced the honda accord was the most stolen car in the us in 2013 with about 54,000 units mostly models built in 2007 or before 346 according to edmundscom between january and august 2013 the model s achieved a high market share of new car sales among the us most expensive zip codes as rated by forbes led by california atherton ranked first with a 15.4 share followed by los altos hills with 11.9 and portola valley with 11.2 during this period the model s had the highest number of new

are overwhelmingly male and over 45 years old 357 retail sales model tesla motors sells its cars directly to consumers without creating a dealer network as other manufacturers have done and as many states require by legislation in support of its approach the company has fought legal and legislative battles in ohio new jersey new york and other states 358 359 with law changes in recent years in new jersey new york maryland ohio and pennsylvania the tesla direct sales model is permitted in 22 states as of march 2015 360 361 as of may 2015update the sales procedure in other states such as texas is somewhat different with the tesla salesperson being prevented from discussing prices the actual sale having to be made online and the sales tax having to be paid up front delivery of a tesla car to a texas address is no different than in other states 362 consequently while tesla showcases and sells its cars directly to the consumer in tesla stores abroad it operates a mix of tesla stores and tesla galleries in the us 363 pricing in june 2012 the model s signature model was priced at us$95,400 and the signature performance model at us$105,400 215 on november 29 2012 tesla announced an all model price increase of us$2,500 for new reservations starting january 1 2013 the price of a pre-paid 60kwh replacement pack was us$10,000 while the 85kwh pack was priced at us$12,000 in 2013 364 as of june 2014update the model with the 60kwh pack begins at us$69,900 the base model with the 85kwh pack starts at us$79,900 and the p85 performance model at us$93,400 as of april 2015update the

edition these prices do not reflect us federal and local government tax credits or purchase incentives 104 as of 2016update with the exception of used teslas all plug-in models depreciate more rapidly than conventionally powered cars and trucks according to nerdwallet for all-electric cars depreciation varies between 60 to 75 in three years in contrast most conventionally powered vehicles in the same period depreciate between 45 to 50 however the tesla model s is more like conventional cars with three-year depreciation of about 40 365 according to black book a three-year-old model s sells for about 62 of its original price 366 according to autolist a used model s with 50,000mi  80,000km on the odometer loses 28 value on average less than similar cars 367 safetyedit safety featuresedit the model s is one of just a few cars to have ever achieved a 5-star safety rating from both euro ncap and the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa 368 369 only two other cars have earned the same recognition since 2011 when the nhtsa introduced its latest rating scheme 370unreliable source first crash with battery fireedit the first widely reported model s fire occurred several minutes after the vehicle hit metal debris on the washington state route 167 highway in kent washington on october 1 2013 373 the driver was able to exit the highway as instructed by the onboard alert system bring the car to a stop and depart the vehicle without injury 374 he then contacted authorities and while awaiting their arrival smoke began coming out the front of the vehicle the driver stated that he hit something while exiting the hov lane 373 375 376 tesla stated that the fire was caused by the direct impact of a large metallic object to one of the 16 battery modules and that by design the modules were separated by firewalls limiting the fire to a small section in the front of the vehicle 373 the module was evidently punctured by a curved section that fell off a truck and was recovered near the accident tesla stated that the debris punched a 3-inch  76mm diameter hole through the .25-inch  6.4mm armor plate under the vehicle applying force of some 25 tons built-in vents directed the flames away from the vehicle so that the fire did not enter the passenger compartment according to tesla the firefighters followed standard procedure using large amounts of water to extinguish the fire was correct 377 however puncturing the metal firewall to gain access to the fire also allowed the flames to spread to the front trunk 374 tesla also stated that because the battery pack contains only about 10 of the energy contained in a gasoline tank the effective combustion potential of a single module is only about 1 that of a conventional vehicle 374 on october 24 2013 the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa announced after reviewing all available data the national highway traffic safety administration has not found evidence at this time that would indicate the recent battery fire involving a tesla model s was the result of a vehicle safety defect or noncompliance with federal safety standards 378 but the following month the nhtsa opened a preliminary evaluation to determine the potential risks associated with undercarriage strikes on model year 2013 tesla model s vehicles 379 380 on march 28 2014 nhtsa closed its investigation claiming that the new titanium underbody shield and aluminum deflector plates along with increased ground clearance should reduce both the frequency of underbody strikes and the resultant fire risk 381 subsequent firesedit on november 6 2013 another fire broke out after a model s struck a tow hitch on the roadway causing damage beneath the vehicle 382 the incidents led tesla to extend its vehicle warranty to cover fire damage and to apply a software update to increase ground clearance when operating at highway speed 379 383 another fire incident took place in toronto canada in early february 2014 the model s was parked in a garage and was not charging when the fire started the origin of the fire is undetermined 384 according to tesla in this particular case we dont yet know the precise cause but have definitively determined that it did not originate in the battery the charging system the adapter or the electrical receptacle as these components were untouched by the fire 385 starting with vehicle bodies manufactured as of 6 march 2014update all units were outfitted with a triple underbody shield existing cars were retrofitted upon request or as part of a normally scheduled service 386 387 on 1 january 2016 a 2014 model s caught fire in norway while supercharging unsupervised the vehicle was totally destroyed but nobody was injured 388 389 390 the fire was slow and the owner had time to unplug the car and retrieve possessions 391 an investigation by the norwegian accident investigation board aibn indicated that the fire originated in the car but was otherwise inconclusive 392 in march 2016 tesla stated that their own investigation into the incident concluded that the fire was caused by a short circuit in the vehicles distribution box but that the amount of damage prevented them from determining the exact cause 391 tesla stated that the supercharger detected the short circuit and deactivated and a future model s software update would stop the vehicle from charging if a short circuit is detected 393 recallsedit on november 20 2015 tesla announced a voluntary worldwide recall of all of its 90,000 model s vehicles in order to check for a possible defect in the cars front seat belt assemblies the problem was raised in early november by one customer in europe teslas resulting investigation was unable to identify a root cause for the failure and the company decided to examine every single car tesla reported that there have been no accidents or injuries related to the problem 394 395 recognitionedit awardsedit 2013 autoguidecom readers choice car of the year 396

yahoo autos 2013 car of the year 413 american automobile association green car guide 2015 top spot p85d 414 the model s also won the 2014 aaa green car guide 415 distance recordsedit as of august 2015update the distance record is 452.8mi  728.7km in a model s on a single charge it was made by norwegian bjørn nyland and his friend morgan tørvolt on a flat stretch with low traffic around the supercharger in rødekro denmark they used hypermiling techniques such as front motor only low speed  39kmh and no airconditioning 416 417 the previous record was 425.8 miles  685.3km made overnight on february 14 2013 by bruno bowden 418 419 420 the first record of 423.5 miles  681.6km was set during november 2012 by david and adam metcalf 421 422 these attempts were inspired by a blog written by elon musk about the planned range and efficiency of the tesla model s offering a prize for anyone exceeding 400 miles  640km on a single charge where it was estimated the 85 kwh model could do it by driving at a constant 36mph  58kmh under ideal conditions 423 controversiesedit range limitationedit on february 8 2013 the new york times published a review by john m broder about a trip between washington dc and boston using teslas supercharger network at the time it included only two stations on the east coast broder made a variety of critical claims about the batterys performance in cold weather and the distance between charging stations the trip ended with the model s carried by a flatbed truck to the milford connecticut station 424 tesla responded by publishing logs of the vehicles charge levels and driving speed that contradicted broders account on several factual details 425 tesla implied that broders behavior forced the car to fail broder replied to the criticism in a blog post and suggested that the speed discrepancies may have been because the car had been equipped with 19-inch wheels rather than the specified 21-inch wheels 426 in the midst of the controversy a cnn reporter recreated broders trip without exhausting the battery however two key differences distinguished the two journeys the weather was about 10f  6c warmer and cnn did the trip in one day the times let the car sit overnight without being plugged in 427 a reporter from cnbc also recreated the trip in one day without incidents 428 one week later a group of tesla owners recreated broders trip without problems one owner was delayed because his car failed to charge and required two firmware updates 429 430 on february 18 2013 new york times public editor margaret sullivan published an editorial stating that broder took casual and imprecise notes of his test drive and did not use good judgment but she maintained that the article was done in good faith she also claimed that broders vehicle logs were sometimes quite misleading 431 432 433 in july and september 2014 tests performed by an independent german car magazine in cooperation with the tüv german association for technical inspection and tesla owners seemed to reveal issues with the batterys performance according to the magazine tesla did not take up the invitation to repeat the test and also seemed to refuse to offer vehicles for a second test 434 435 a test performed by another german publication die welt supported the findings 436 nhtsa safest caredit on august 19 2013 based on nhtsa safety ratings a tesla press release claimed that the model s had achieved the best safety rating of any car ever tested tesla stated nhtsa does not publish a star rating above 5 however safety levels better than 5 stars are captured in the overall vehicle safety score vss provided to manufacturers where the model s achieved a new combined record of 5.4 stars 437 438 439 440 441 however a few days later nhtsa rebutted teslas claim explaining that the rating for the model s was equal to any other car receiving 5-stars and claiming that the carmaker did not follow its advertising guidelines 442 443 444 power dissipation when not in useedit older versions of the system software suffered from power drain issues when the car wasnt being used with the batteries losing 4.5 kwh overnight known commonly as vampire drain 445 system software v5.8 v1.49.30 released december 12 2013 reduced overnight energy loss substantially to 1.1kwh per night or around 3 miles 92 in january 2014 bjørn nyland a model s owner in norway recorded a range loss of approximately 20 during a 27-day extended vacation an indicated range loss of 63 miles  101km or 2.3 miles  3.7km per day while stored in frigid temperatures without any charging cable attached 446 consumer reports recommendationedit in october 2015 two months after naming the tesla the best car ever tested consumer reports declined to give the tesla model s a recommended designation citing too many complaints from owners complaints ranged from minor such as misaligned doors and squeaky body to severe - things like total drive train replacement and inoperable door handles teslas shares dropped 15 both because of the magazines cut and because of concerns over the tesla model x luxury suv 31 447 similarly edmundscom found quality and safety issues in their long-term road test and amassed quite the repair résumé during the last 17 months 448 both edmunds and consumer reports reported issues including the vehicle stalling while driving 449 in their 2016 annual auto reliability survey consumer reports improved the model s rating to average reliability while reporting that the model x has had significant malfunction issues the magazine also raised serious concerns about how some automakers including tesla have designed deployed and marketed semi-autonomous technology 32 power discrepancyedit the p85d insane was widely reported to have 691 horsepower 450 451 but some owners reported 20 less power on dynamometer in various circumstances 452 453 manufacturers are required by eu law to display power at full setting of the power controller from an external dc source when performing laboratory vehicle approval but not necessarily to show power limited by battery other equipment must be removed or their power added to the measurement 454 455 actual power available depends on circumstances 454 as it does for piston cars 456 which until 1972 could be 25–30 less than given 457 458 as of november 2015update tesla website shows battery-limited combined 463hp for p85d  532hp for ludicrous 459 452 autonomy limitationsedit the autonomy features of the model s including autosteer and traffic-aware cruise control have limitations that have led to collisions when the driver becomes inattentive 460 tesla warns in the owners manual that drivers always must be aware of road conditions and not rely on the cruise control to prevent a collision 461 as the system may not detect stationary vehicles or obstacles bicycles and pedestrians however critics such as scientist andrew ng have accused tesla of being irresponsible by releasing a product with such limitations as it can lull drivers into a false sense of security 462 electrical consumption of tesla model sedit in early march 2016 a report by stuff magazine revealed that test performed by vicom ltd on behalf of singapores land transport authority had found a 2014 tesla model s to be consuming 444whkm  0.715kwhmi 463 464 which was greater than the 236whkm  0.38kwhmi reported by the us environmental protection agency epa 465 and the 181whkm  0.291kwhmi reported by tesla 466 as a result a carbon surcharge of s$15,000 us$10,900 was imposed on the model s making singapore the only country in the world to impose an environmental surcharge on a fully electric car 467 the land transport authority justified this by stating that it had to account for co2 emissions during the electricity generation process and therefore a grid emission factor of 0.5gwatt-hour was also applied to the electric energy consumption 468 however tesla motors countered that when the energy used to extract refine and distribute gasoline was taken into account the model s produces approximately one-third the co2 of an equivalent gasoline-powered vehicle 466 later that month the land transport authority released a statement stating that they and the vicom emission test laboratory will be working with tesla engineers to determine if there was a flaw in the test 469 and a tesla statement indicated that the discussions were positive and that they were confident of a quick resolution 466 see alsoedit electric car use by country government incentives for plug-in
