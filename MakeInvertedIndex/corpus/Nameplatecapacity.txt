nameplate capacity nameplate capacity also known as the rated capacity nominal capacity installed capacity or maximum effect is the intended full-load sustained output of a facility such as a power plant 1 2 a chemical plant 3 fuel plant 4 5 6 metal refinery 7 mine 8 and many others nameplate capacity is the number registered with authorities for classifying the power output of a power station usually expressed in megawatts mw 9 power plants with an output consistently near their nameplate capacity have a high capacity factor  contents 1 dispatchable power 2 non-dispatchable power 3 generator capacity 4 see also 5 references  dispatchable poweredit for dispatchable power this capacity depends on the internal technical capability of the plant to maintain output for a reasonable amount of time for example a day neither momentarily nor permanently and without considering external events such as lack of fuel or internal events such as maintenance 10 actual output can be different from nameplate capacity for a number of reasons depending on equipment and circumstances 10 11 non-dispatchable poweredit for non-dispatchable power particularly renewable energy nameplate capacity refers to generation under ideal conditions output is generally limited by weather conditions hydroelectric dam water levels tidal variations and other outside forces equipment failures and maintenance usually contribute less to capacity factor reduction than the innate variation of the power source in photovoltaics capacity is rated under standard test conditions usually expressed in the non-si compliant unit watt-peak wp in addition a pv systems nameplate capacity is sometimes denoted by a subindex for example mwdc or mwac in order to clarify whether the raw dc or already converted ac power output is referred to generator capacityedit the term is connected with nameplates on electrical generators as these plates describing the model name and manufacturer usually also contain the rated output 12 but the rated output of a power station to the electrical grid is invariably less than the generator nameplate capacity because the components connecting the actual generator to the grid also use power thus there is a distinction between component capacity and facility capacity see alsoedit energy portal availability factor declared net capacity power plants electricity generation intermittent power sourceterminology list of energy storage projects referencesedit v t e availability factor base load black start capacity factor demand factor demand management eroei fault grid storage intermittency load factor load following nameplate capacity peak demand power quality power-flow study repowering variability coal fossil-fuel power station natural gas petroleum nuclear oil shale biomass biofuel geothermal hydro marine current osmotic thermal tidal wave solar wind current osmotic thermal tidal wave ac power cogeneration combined cycle cooling tower induction generator micro chp microgeneration rankine cycle three-phase electric power virtual power plant blackout rolling blackout brownout demand response distributed generation dynamic demand electric power distribution electric power system electric power transmission electrical grid high-voltage direct current load management pumped hydro power station power storage smart grid substation super grid transformer transmission system operator tso transmission tower utility pole arc-faultcircuitinterrupter earth leakage circuit breaker residual-current device gfi power-system protection protective relay digital protective relay sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker carbon offset cost of electricity by source ecotax energy subsidies feed-in tariff fossil-fuel phase-out net metering pigovian tax renewable energy certificates renewable energy payments renewable energy policy spark spread
