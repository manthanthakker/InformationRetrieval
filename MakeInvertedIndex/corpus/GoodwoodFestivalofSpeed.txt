steeped in british motor racing history shortly after taking over the estate in the early 1990s lord march as he is formally known wanted to bring back motor racing to goodwood circuit but did not have the necessary permit to host a race there therefore he instead hosted it on his own grounds with a small selection of entrants made up of invited historic vehicles the first event that took place on sunday 13 june proved to be a success taking in a crowd of 25,000 despite a date clash with the 24 hours of le mans that year after the first events date clash lord march would ensure that the event would never be allowed to clash with either le mans or formula one races in 1994 saturday was added making it a weekend event in 1996 friday was added making it a three-day event in 2010 the moving motor show was added on the thursday features and attractionsedit the hill climbedit thanks to the events classification as a hill climb its location and desire to reflect the style and history of motor sport visitors are afforded close views of the action - separated only by a few metres and reinforced straw bales from the track visitors are free to walk around several paddocks where the cars and drivers can be seen at close quarters the atmosphere of the festival of speed when compared to the separation of fans from drivers and machines common to most top end motor sport events encourages participation by the fans the track has an elevation change of 92.7 metres for an average gradient of 4.9 the record time for the hillclimb was set in 1999 when nick heidfeld drove a mclaren mp4/13 formula one car up the hill in 41.6 seconds  100.385mph  161.554kmh for safety reasons formula one cars are no longer allowed to do official timed runs and will often focus on demonstrations that are spectacular rather than fast in 2006 heikki kovalainen completed the course in a renault r25 f1 car and was unofficially timed below 40 seconds 2 in 2016 to commemorate the 40 year anniversary of james hunt winning the f1 world championship mclaren commissioned a p1 gtr which ran up the hill driven by bruno senna 3 soapbox challengeedit from 2000 to 2004 this was a downhill race for gravity-powered cars starting from just below the hill-climb finish line to a finish line in front of the house it included entries from cosworth prodrive and other top companies with some famous ridersdrivers piloting them including barry sheene however there were frequent accidents despite an official cap on the cost of cars the unofficial costs were becoming too high so it did not return in 2005 the forest rally stageedit from 2005 to present there has been a demonstration area for the rally cars at the top of the hill initially in 2005 the track through the forest was widened and the rally cars ran down through the forest turned on the tarmac section just outside the wood and returned up the same track this meant that the cars could only run one-at-a-time in 2006 a full forest stage was introduced designed by hannu mikkola 4 this was a complete circuit with a separate start and finish line at the top of the wood this allowed the cars to start at timed intervals allowing many more cars to run ever since its inception southern car club have been entrusted with the organization of the rally stage held under an msa permit supercar runedit since 2000 there has been a sunday times supercar run for road-going supercars since 2014 cars could opt to do a timed run it is now common for specialty car manufacturers to show off their latest sports model including newly released mass-produced sports models and working concept models cartier style et luxeedit since 1995 5 this is an auto show which takes place to the west of the house it is a similar format to the pebble beach concours delegance entry is usually by invitation and this provides some leeway as to which type of vehicle can enter usually resulting in a more varied event than usual concours delegance unlike most concours shows the cartier style et luxe is judged by a panel of selected judges consisting of celebrities from all around the world to car designers 6 the moving motor showedit since 2010 the moving motor show was added mainly in response to the cancellation of the british international motor show aimed exclusively for buyers of new cars allowing them a chance to test the cars on the course 7 following its success it was announced the mms would return in 2011 8 the 2010 event also included the running of the new mclaren mp4-12c the official website lists the festival of speed dates as the friday to sunday but the weekend tickets for the festival include a moving motor show ticket 9 so its not strictly part of the festival of speed but it is a part of the festival
