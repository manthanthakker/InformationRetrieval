group romm was also a registered lobbyist representing the interests of clients ion america and sunpower corp 38 during these years romm wrote widely on global warming and energy technologies that can reduce global warming his 2004 book the hype about hydrogen argues that putting off the implementation of current green technologies in favor of waiting for technological breakthroughs in hydrogen cars is a dangerous distraction that will delay urgently needed government action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions 39 the book was named one of the best science and technology books of 2004 by library journal 40 in reviewing the book daniel i sperling a member of arnold schwarzeneggers california air resources board offered dissenting views 41 in 2004 romm also wrote the national commission on energy policys report the car and fuel of the future 42 which was rated the #1 hottest article on energy policy by sciencedirect 43 he was also the principal investigator for the national science foundation project future directions for hydrogen energy research and education  2004 44 romm is interviewed in the 2006 documentary film who killed the electric car 24 directed by chris paine and narrated by martin sheen in the film romm gives a presentation intended to show that the governments hydrogen car initiative was a bad policy choice and a distraction that was delaying the exploitation of more promising technologies such as electric and hybrid cars that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase americas energy security as of 2010 romm continued to view hydrogen as a breakthrough technology illusion 45 romms 2006 book hell and high water projects that humans have a window of opportunity of only about a decade to head off the most catastrophic effects of global warming it calls upon americans to demand government action to encourage and require the use of current emission-cutting technologies 46 tyler hamilton in his review of the book for the toronto star wrote whereas the first third of romms book presents overwhelming and disturbing evidence that human-caused greenhouse gases are the primary ingredients behind global warming the pages that follow offer alarming detail on how the us public is being misled by a federal government backed by conservative political forces that is intent on inaction and thats also on a mission to derail international efforts to curb emissions 47 technology review wrote that hell and high water provides an accurate summary of what is known about global warming and climate change a sensible agenda for technology and policy and a primer on how political disinformation has undermined climate science 9 climate progress and recent yearsedit since late 2006 romm has been a senior fellow at the center for american progress 48 founding their climate blog climate progress which focuses on climate science policy and reporting 49 in 2008 time magazine named his blog one of the top 15 green websites writing that it counters bad science and inane rhetoric with original analysis delivered sharply  romm occupies the intersection of climate science economics and policy resist temptation to lump him in with knee-jerk enviros on his blog and in his december 2006 book hell and high water you can find some of the most cogent memorable and deployable arguments for immediate and overwhelming action to confront global warming 6 in 2010 time magazine wrote viewing climate change through the prism of national security romm analyzes breaking energy news and the relevant research but most important he challenges the beliefs and conclusions of the mainstream media on climate-change issues 8 as of 2016 romm continues to contribute to the site 11 romm also writes for other top internet energy and news sites including the huffington post 50 grist 51 slate 52 cnn 53 and saloncom 54 his july 2012 new york times opinion piece was called without carbon controls we face a dust bowl 55 romm has testified numerous times before congressional committees on energy and global warming issues offering his views on government action to curb global warming 56 for example in july 2012 he testified before a natural resources subcommittee of the us house of representatives on the 2012 us drought and wildfires 57 in march of the same year he testified before the house energy  commerce committee on the the american energy initiative and rising gasoline prices 58 in 2010 he testified before the house ways and means committee on how to optimize energy tax incentives driving the green job economy 59 and in 2007 he testified before the house committee on science and technology on the subject of fuels for the future specifically the use of liquid fuel from coal which he believes would accelerate global warming 60 he also lectures on energy technology global warming and how the media portrays climate change 61 romms 2010 book straight up is largely a selection of his best blog postings over the past few years related to climate change issues 62 treehugger describes the book as a whirlwind tour through the state of climate change the media that so badly neglects it the politicians who attempt to address it and those who obstruct their efforts and ignore the science and the clean energy solutions that could help get us out of the mess 63 in 2011 romm sat on the panel of the green car summit of the washington auto show 64 his 2012 book language intelligence concerns persuasion and the effective use of rhetoric ed markey commented on the book joe masterfully  scripts ways to master the metaphor and incorporate irony solutions the reader can use for speeches social media or just winning the debate around the kitchen table 65 66 romm wrote an article for time magazine in august 2012 using the research from language intelligence to analyze whether mitt romney or barack obama is the more effective communicator 67 in speeches and lectures since then romm has advocated that scientists use the principles of effective communication outlined in the book instead of their usual technical neutral style to better explain the dangers of and solutions to climate change to lay people and the media 68 romm is the chief science editor for the documentary tv series years of living dangerously about the impact of and solutions to climate change the first season of the series ran in 2014 on the showtime network 69 70 he wrote climate change 101 an introduction for the series website 71 a second season is scheduled to run in 2016 on the national geographic channel 72 the first season won the 2014 emmy award for outstanding documentary or nonfiction series 10 in 2015 the weather channel included romm as one of the worlds 25 most compelling voices on climate 73 in its series the climate 25 74 that year romm also wrote the book climate change what everyone needs to know a primer on the topic in qa format 11 75 ralph benko in forbes magazine wrote that the impressive book  lucidly presents the case both for deep concern and optimism 76 media comment and interviewsedit romm is often cited quoted or interviewed by journalists to explain the impact of public policy and energy technologies and applications on global warming and energy security or to explain causes and impacts of climate change or the influence of the media 77 for example in 2009 msnbc relied on him to assess natural gas hydrates 78 and he was featured on 60 minutes discussing the scientific evidence that clean coal is not clean 79 in 2010 msnbcs countdown with keith olbermann program interviewed romm on how the military is taking action on climate change to improve national security 80 guernica magazine interviewed him on the science and politics of global warming 81 the new yorker asked him to comment on the koch-funded exhibit on evolution and climate change at the national museum of natural history 82 and the atlantic and cbs news each reviewed a media call by romm concerning the relationship between the january 2010 snowstorms in washington dc and global warming 83 in 2011 the washington post linked with approval to romms review of the scientific literature on climate change 84 time magazine explored romms critique of matthew nisbet 85 and praised his analysis of the decline of media coverage regarding climate change 86 national geographic quoted him about the part that the media has played in the dearth of information about climate reaching the public 87 the same year technology review quoted romm regarding the relationship between government-assisted deployment and rapid innovation in energy technologies 88 and the toronto star quoted him regarding president obamas 2011 state of the union address 89 in 2012 in the new york times economist paul krugman cited romm on the connection between drought and climate change 90 and the atlantic interviewed and cited him on the reluctance of the democrats to discuss climate change 91 national geographic quoted him about disappearing arctic ice and the effect of climate change on the polar bear 92 and current tvs bill press interviewed romm about record-breaking heat 93 in 2014 businessweek quoted romm regarding the lack of commercial viability of hydrogen fuel cells for cars 94 and the guardian quoted him concerning international cooperation on climate change 95 in 2015 the guardian quoted romm about historic high global temperatures 96 and marketwatch quoted him on actions that donald trump might take concerning climate agreements if he were to be elected president 97 later that year bulletin of the atomic scientists interviewed him about nuclear power and climate change 98 the wall street journal quoted romm in 2016 about the cost and pace of change in clean energy technology 99 romms viewsedit the new york times dot earth column reviewed romms views on global warming solutions on november 24 2008 including his belief that to combat global warming humans cannot wait for new technologies and scientific breakthroughs that instead we must deploy existing and near-term low-carbon technologies as fast as is humanly possible 100 101 in his blog romm has described the technology solutions that he believes can control global warming 102 103 the new york times also quoted romm as stating that to solve the climate crisis we will need a wwii-style approach the article noted romms belief that credible people and the press should publicly support the notion that government action is needed to help solve the global warming crisis in particular the press should explain how current news stories such as hurricanes droughts and insect infestations are related to global warming 100 according to us news  world report romm believes that global warming is advancing more swiftly than most people think and than the mainstream media usually report he has called for significantly ramping up government spending on clean energy technology halting the construction of new coal plants rapidly increasing the use of energy-efficient technologies and imposing a cap-and-trade system to sharply limit carbon dioxide emissions 104 in 2006 in a radio interview romm stated global warming is going to transform this country and our transportation and the way we live our lives if we dont act pretty soon in an intelligent fashion then change will be forced upon us by the radically changed climate global warming is the issue of the century 105 in march 2009 romm summarized and updated his views in an introduction to his blog 106 and in another post setting forth a summary of global warming impacts 107 in 2011 romm stated that feeding some 9 billion people by mid-century in the face of a rapidly worsening climate may well be the greatest challenge the human race has ever faced 108 romms 2010 book straight up notes the bottom line is that the economic cost of action is low whereas the cost of inaction is incalculably greater romm calculates that deployment of existing technologies on the massive scale that can save the climate can be accomplished at the cost of 0.12 percent of global gdp per year he also asks in the book will the united states be a global leader in creating jobs and exports in clean energy technologies or will we be importing them from europe japan and the likely clean energy leader in our absence china 109 in 2005 with respect to the us congresss actions on climate including its votes on the xl pipeline romm told the guardian future generations suffering from the consequences of our inaction will be bewildered that the legislative body of the richest country in the world could devote so little effort to ameliorating the climate problem and so much effort to making it worse 110 romm has been critical of media coverage of global warming in his 2010 book straight up he wrote historically even the most respected newspapers have fallen into the trap of giving the same credence  and often the same amount of space  to a handful of us scientists most receiving funds from the fossil fuel industry as they give to hundreds of the worlds leading climate scientists no surprise that much of the public has ended up with a misimpression about the remarkable strength of our scientific understanding and the need for action he concludes more and more pieces are being written by senior political reporters who know very little about global warming 111 romm also believes that scientists and politicians need to be more effective communicators about climate change 112 reputationedit in 2008 romm was elected a fellow of the american association for the advancement of science for distinguished service toward a sustainable energy future and for persuasive discourse on why citizens corporations and governments should adopt sustainable technologies 113 114 in 2009 rolling stone magazine named romm to its list of "100 people who are changing america quoting journalist david roberts as follows joe combines two qualities you dont often find together a deep knowledge of technology policy and science along with genuine moral passion 4 former houston texas mayor bill white called romm the nations leading expert on energy efficiency 115 us news  world report featured romm as one of eight key players who were driving public policy in washington calling romm an oft-cited expert on climate change issues and a go-to witness at congressional hearings 104 time magazine named romm one of its heroes of the environment  2009 writing he combines  intellect with a strong sense of moral outrage he also possesses a jon stewart-like quality for pointing out the absurdity of his opponents 5 time named his blog as one of the top 15 green websites in 2009 6 the same year thomas l friedman in the new york times called

accounts to follow 118 reviewing romms 2010 book straight up bill mckibben wrote that romm knows his climate science  and has been a persuasive voice for the most important truth about global warming that it is a far worse problem than either politicians or the general public understand  romm has been consistent in insisting that we have much of the technology necessary to at least begin tackling the problem he called romm a tireless foil to the right-wing disinformation machine that has tried  with great success  to delay action by confusing and disheartening americans about global warming  it requires a thick skin to take on the daily task of dealing with the disinformers but romm has the taste for this kind of blood sport and the talent as well 119 in 2011 the new york times called romm one of the countrys most influential writers on climate change 120 in 2012 planetsave wrote that romm is considered the worlds best blogger on climate science and politics related to it 121
