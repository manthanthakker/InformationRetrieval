liquid nitrogen liquid nitrogen is nitrogen in a liquid state at an extremely low temperature it is a colorless clear liquid with a density of 0.807 gml at its boiling point −195.79c  77k −320f and a dielectric constant of 1.43 1 nitrogen was first liquefied at the jagiellonian university on 15 april 1883 by polish physicists zygmunt wróblewski and karol olszewski 2 it is produced industrially by fractional distillation of liquid air liquid nitrogen is often referred to by the abbreviation ln2 or lin or ln and has the un number 1977 liquid nitrogen is a diatomic liquid which means that the diatomic character of the covalent n bonding in n2 gas is retained after liquefaction 3 liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic fluid that can cause rapid freezing on contact with living tissue when appropriately insulated from ambient heat liquid nitrogen can be stored and transported for example in vacuum flasks the temperature is held constant at 77k by slow boiling of the liquid resulting in the evolution of nitrogen gas depending on the size and design the holding time of vacuum flasks dewars ranges from a few hours to a few weeks the development of pressurised super-insulated vacuum vessels has enabled liquefied nitrogen to be stored and transported over longer time periods with losses reduced to 2 per day or less 4 the temperature of liquid nitrogen can readily be reduced to its freezing point 63k −210c −346f by placing it in a vacuum chamber pumped by a vacuum pump 5 liquid nitrogens efficiency as a coolant is limited by the fact that it boils immediately on contact with a warmer object enveloping the object in insulating nitrogen gas this effect known as the leidenfrost effect applies to any liquid in contact with an object significantly hotter than its boiling point faster cooling may be obtained by plunging an object into a slush of liquid and solid nitrogen rather than liquid nitrogen alone  contents 1 uses 1.1 culinary use of liquid nitrogen 2 safety 3 production 4 see also 5 references 1.1 culinary use of liquid nitrogen  uses liquid nitrogen is a compact and readily transported source of dry nitrogen gas as it does not require pressurization further its ability to maintain temperatures far below the freezing point of water makes it extremely useful in a wide range of applications primarily as an open-cycle refrigerant including in cryotherapy for removing unsightly or potentially malignant skin lesions such as warts and actinic keratosis to store cells at low temperature for laboratory work in cryogenics in a cryophorus to demonstrate rapid freezing by evaporation as a backup nitrogen source in hypoxic air fire prevention systems as a source of very dry nitrogen gas for the immersion freezing and transportation of food products for the cryopreservation of blood reproductive cells sperm and egg and other biological samples and materials to preserve tissue samples from surgical excisions for future studies to facilitate cryoconservation of animal genetic resources as a method of freezing water and oil pipes in order to work on them in situations where a valve is not available to block fluid flow to the work area method known as a cryogenic isolation frequently used in industry and new york district steam pipework  electrical heat pumps are now often used for small pipe diameters in the process of promession a way to dispose of the dead for cryonic preservation in hopes of future reanimation to shrink-weld machinery parts together as a coolant for ccd cameras in astronomy for a high-temperature

mentioned in an 1890 recipe book titled fancy ices authored by mrs agnes marshall 14 but has been employed in more recent times by restaurants in the preparation of frozen desserts such as ice cream which can be created within moments at the table because of the speed at which it cools food 14 the rapidity of chilling also leads to the formation of smaller ice crystals which provides the dessert with a smoother texture 14 the technique is employed by chef heston blumenthal who has used it at his restaurant the fat duck to create frozen dishes such as egg and bacon ice cream 14 15 liquid nitrogen has also become popular in the preparation of cocktails because it can be used to quickly chill glasses or freeze ingredients 16 it is also added to drinks to create a smoky effect which occurs as tiny droplets of the liquid nitrogen come into contact with the surrounding air condensing the vapour that is naturally present 16 safety because the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20c  68f a tremendous amount of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporized in an enclosed space in an incident on january 12 2006 at texas am university the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed as a result of the subsequent pressure buildup the tank failed catastrophically the force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2 m off their foundations 17 because of its extremely low temperature careless handling of liquid nitrogen and any objects cooled by it may result in cold burns in that case special gloves should be used while handling however a small splash or even pouring down skin will not burn immediately because the evaporating gas thermally insulates to some extent like touching a hot element very briefly with a wet finger if the liquid nitrogen pools anywhere it will burn severely as liquid nitrogen evaporates it reduces the oxygen concentration in the air and can act as an asphyxiant especially in confined spaces nitrogen is odorless colorless and tasteless and may produce asphyxia without any sensation or prior warning 18 19 20 oxygen sensors are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space 21 vessels containing liquid nitrogen can condense oxygen from air the liquid in such a vessel becomes increasingly enriched in oxygen boiling point 90k −183c −298f as the nitrogen evaporates and can cause violent oxidation of organic material 22 ingestion of liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage for example in 2012 a young woman in england had her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen 23 production liquid nitrogen is produced commercially from the cryogenic distillation of liquified air or from the liquefication of pure nitrogen derived from air using pressure swing adsorption an air compressor is used to compress filtered air to high pressure the high-pressure gas is cooled back to ambient temperature and allowed to expand to a low pressure the expanding air cools greatly the joulethomson effect and oxygen nitrogen and argon are separated by further stages of expansion and distillation small-scale production of liquid nitrogen is easily achieved using this principle liquid nitrogen may be produced for direct sale or as a byproduct of manufacture of liquid oxygen used for industrial processes such as steelmaking liquid-air plants producing on the order of tons per day of product started to be built in the 1930s but became very common after the second world war a large modern plant may produce 3000 tonsday of liquid air products 24 see also industrial gas computer cooling cryogenic nitrogen plant liquid nitrogen vehicle references gnd 4154696-9
