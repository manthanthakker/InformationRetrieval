eucalyptus aromadendron andrews ex steud eucalypton st-lag eudesmia rbr symphyomyrtus schauer 1 eucalyptus ˌjuːkəˈlɪptəs 2 lheritier 1789 3 is a diverse genus of flowering trees and shrubs including a distinct group with a multiple-stem mallee growth habit in the myrtle family myrtaceae members of the genus dominate the tree flora of australia and include the tallest known flowering plant on earth there are more than 700 species of eucalyptus and most are native to australia a very small number are found in adjacent areas of new guinea and indonesia one species eucalyptus deglupta ranges as far north as the philippines of the 15 species found outside australia just nine are exclusively non-australian species of eucalyptus are cultivated widely in the tropical and temperate world including the americas europe africa the mediterranean basin the middle east china and the indian subcontinent however the range over which many eucalypts can be planted in the temperate zone is constrained by their limited cold tolerance 4 eucalyptus is one of three similar genera that are commonly referred to as eucalypts the others being corymbia and angophora many species though by no means all are known as gum trees because they exude copious kino from any break in the bark eg scribbly gum the generic name is derived from the greek words ευ eu well and καλύπτω kalýpto to cover referring to the operculum on the calyx that initially conceals the flower 5 some eucalyptus species have attracted attention from horticulturists global development researchers and environmentalists because of desirable traits such as being fast-growing sources of wood producing oil that can be used for cleaning and as a natural insecticide or an ability to be used to drain swamps and thereby reduce the risk of malaria eucalyptus oil finds many uses like in aromatherapy as a cure for joint pains eucalyptus trees show allelopathic effects they release compounds which inhibit other plant species from growing nearby outside their natural ranges eucalypts are both lauded for their beneficial economic impact on poor populations 6 7:22 and criticised for being water-guzzling aliens 8 leading to controversy over their total impact 9 on warm days eucalyptus forests are sometimes shrouded in a smog-like mist of vaporised volatile organic compounds terpenoids the australian blue mountains take

may take the form of a low shrub or a very large tree the species can be divided into three main habits and four size categories as a generalisation forest trees are single-stemmed and have a crown forming a minor proportion of the whole tree height woodland trees are single-stemmed although they may branch at a short distance above ground level mallees are multistemmed from ground level usually less than 10m  33ft in height often with the crown predominantly at the ends of the branchlets and individual plants may combine to form either an open or closed formation many mallee trees may be so low-growing as to be considered a shrub two other tree forms are notable in western australia and described using the native names mallet and marlock the mallet is a small to medium-sized tree that does not produce lignotubers and has a relatively long trunk a steeply branching habit and often a conspicuously dense terminal crown this is the normal habit of mature healthy specimens of eucalyptus occidentalis e astringens e spathulata e gardneri e dielsii e forrestiana e salubris e clivicola and e ornata the smooth bark of mallets often has a satiny sheen and may be white cream grey green or copper the term marlock has been variously used in forest trees of australia it is defined as a small tree without lignotubers but with a shorter lower-branching trunk than a mallet they usually grow in more or less pure stands clearly recognisable examples are stands of e platypus e vesiculosa and the unrelated e stoatei the term morrell is somewhat obscure in origin and appears to apply to trees of the western australian wheatbelt and goldfields which have a long straight trunk completely rough-barked it is now used mainly for e longicornis red morrell and e melanoxylon black morrell tree sizes follow the convention of small to 10m  33ft in height medium-sized 10–30m  33–98ft tall 30–60m  98–197ft very tall over 60m  200ft leavesedit nearly all eucalyptus are evergreen but some tropical species lose their leaves at the end of the dry season as in other members of the myrtle family eucalyptus leaves are covered with oil glands the copious oils produced are an important feature of the genus although mature eucalyptus trees may be towering and fully leafed their shade is characteristically patchy because the leaves usually hang downwards the leaves on a mature eucalyptus plant are commonly lanceolate petiolate apparently alternate and waxy or glossy green in contrast the leaves of seedlings are often opposite sessile and glaucous but many exceptions to this pattern exist many species such as e melanophloia and e setosa retain the juvenile leaf form even when the plant is reproductively mature some species such as e macrocarpa e rhodantha and e crucis are sought-after ornamentals due to this lifelong juvenile leaf form a few species such as e petraea e dundasii and e lansdowneana have shiny green leaves throughout their life cycle e caesia exhibits the opposite pattern of leaf development to most eucalyptus with shiny green leaves in the seedling stage and dull glaucous leaves in mature crowns the contrast between juvenile and adult leaf phases is valuable in field identification four leaf phases are recognised in the development of a eucalyptus plant the seedling juvenile intermediate and adult phases however no definite transitional point occurs between the phases the intermediate phase when the largest leaves are often formed links the juvenile and adult phases 11 in all except a few species the leaves form in pairs on opposite sides of a square stem consecutive pairs being at right angles to each other decussate in some narrow-leaved species for example e oleosa the seedling leaves after the second leaf pair are often clustered in a detectable spiral arrangement about a five-sided stem after the spiral phase which may last from several to many nodes the arrangement reverts to decussate by the absorption of some of the leaf-bearing faces of the stem in those species with opposite adult foliage the leaf pairs which have been formed opposite at the stem apex become separated at their bases by unequal elongation of the stem to produce the apparently alternate adult leaves flowersedit the most readily recognisable characteristics of eucalyptus species are the distinctive flowers and fruit capsules or gumnuts flowers have numerous fluffy stamens which may be white cream yellow pink or red in bud the stamens are enclosed in a cap known as an operculum which is composed of the fused sepals or petals or both thus flowers have no petals but instead decorate themselves with the many showy stamens as the stamens expand the operculum is forced off splitting away from the cup-like base of the flower this is one of the features that unites the genus the name eucalyptus from the greek words eu- well and kaluptos cover meaning well-covered describes the operculum the woody fruits or capsules are roughly cone-shaped and have valves at the end which open to release the seeds which are waxy rod-shaped about 1mm in length and yellow-brown in colour most species do not flower until adult foliage starts to appear e cinerea and e perriniana are notable exceptions barkedit the appearance of eucalyptus bark varies with the age of the plant the manner of bark shed the length of the bark fibres the degree of furrowing the thickness the hardness and the colour all mature eucalypts put on an annual layer of bark which contributes to the increasing diameter of the stems in some species the outermost layer dies and is annually deciduous either in long strips as in e sheathiana or in variably sized flakes e diversicolor e cosmophylla or e cladocalyx these are the gums or smooth-barked species the gum bark may be dull shiny or satiny as in e ornata or matte e cosmophylla in many species the dead bark is retained its outermost layer gradually fragments with weathering and sheds without altering the essentially rough-barked nature of the trunks or stems  for example e marginata e jacksonii e obliqua and e porosa many species are half-barks or blackbutts in which the dead bark is retained in the lower half of the trunks or stems  for example e brachycalyx e ochrophloia and e occidentalis  or only in a thick black accumulation at the base as in e clelandii in some species in this category for example e youngiana and e viminalis the rough basal bark is very ribbony at the top where it gives way to the smooth upper stems the smooth upper bark of the half-barks and that of the completely smooth-barked trees and mallees can produce remarkable colour and interest for example e deglupta 11 different commonly recognised types of bark include stringybark  consists of long fibres and can be pulled off in long pieces it is usually thick with a spongy texture ironbark  is hard rough and deeply furrowed it is impregnated with dried kino a sap exuded by the tree which gives a dark red or even black colour tessellated  bark is broken up into many distinct flakes they are corkish and can flake off box  has short fibres some also show tessellation ribbon  has the bark coming off in long thin pieces but is still loosely attached in some places they can be long ribbons firmer strips or twisted curls fossil recordedit the oldest definitive eucalyptus fossils are surprisingly from south america where eucalypts are no longer endemic though have been introduced from australia the fossils are from the early eocene  51.9 mya and were found in the laguna del hunco deposit in chubut province in argentina 12 this shows that the genus had a gondwanan distribution fossil leaves also occur in the miocene of new zealand where the genus is not native today but again have been introduced from australia 13 despite the prominence of eucalyptus in modern australia estimated to contribute some 75 of the modern vegetation the fossil record is very scarce throughout much of the cenozoic and suggests that this rise to dominance is a geologically more recent phenomenon the oldest reliably dated macrofossil of eucalyptus is a 21-million-year-old tree-stump encased in basalt in the upper lachlan valley in new south wales other fossils have been found but many are either unreliably dated or else unreliably identified 14 it is useful to consider where eucalyptus fossils have not been found extensive research has gone into the fossil floras of the paleocene to oligocene of south-eastern australia and has failed to uncover a single eucalyptus specimen although the evidence is sparse the best hypothesis is that in the mid-tertiary the contintental margins of australia only supported more mesic noneucalypt vegetation and that eucalypts probably contributed to the drier vegetation of the arid continental interior with the progressive drying out of the continent since the miocene eucalypts were displaced to the continental margins and much of the mesic and rainforest vegetation that was once there was eliminated entirely 14 the current superdominance of eucalyptus in australia may be an artefact of human influence on its ecology in more recent sediments numerous findings of a dramatic increase in the abundance of eucalyptus pollen are associated with increased charcoal levels though this occurs at different rates throughout australia it is compelling evidence for a relationship between the artificial increase of fire frequency with the arrival of aboriginals and increased prevalence of this exceptionally fire-tolerant genus 14 species and hybridismedit over 700 species of eucalyptus are known refer to the list of eucalyptus species for a comprehensive list of species some have diverged from the mainstream of the genus to the extent that they are quite isolated genetically and are able to be recognised by only a few relatively invariant characteristics most however may be regarded as belonging to large or small groups of related species which are often in geographical contact with each other and between which gene exchange still occurs in these situations many species appear to grade into one another and intermediate forms are common in other words some species are relatively fixed genetically as expressed in their morphology while others have not diverged completely from their nearest relatives hybrid individuals have not always been recognised as such on first collection and some have been named as new species such as e chrysantha e preissiana  e sepulcralis and e rivalis e marginata  e megacarpa hybrid combinations are not particularly common in the field but some other published species frequently seen in australia have been suggested to be hybrid combinations for example e erythrandra is believed to be e angulosa  e teraptera and due to its wide distribution is often referred to in texts 11 renantherin a phenolic compound present in the leaves of some eucalyptus species allows chemotaxonomic discrimanation in the sections renantheroideae and renantherae 15 and the ratio of the amount of leucoanthocyanins varies considerably in certain species 16 related generaedit a small genus of similar trees angophora has also been known since the 18th century in 1995 new evidence largely genetic indicated that some prominent eucalyptus species were actually more closely related to angophora than to the other eucalypts they were split off into the new genus corymbia although separate the three groups are allied and it remains acceptable to refer to the members of all three genera angophora corymbia and eucalyptus as eucalypts tall timberedit several eucalypt species are among the tallest trees in the world eucalyptus regnans the australian mountain ash is the tallest of all flowering plants angiosperms today the tallest measured specimen named centurion is 99.6m  327ft tall 17 coast douglas-fir is about the same height only coast redwood is taller and they are conifers gymnosperms six other eucalypt species exceed 80 metres in height eucalyptus obliqua eucalyptus delegatensis eucalyptus diversicolor eucalyptus nitens eucalyptus globulus and eucalyptus viminalis frost intoleranceedit most eucalypts are not tolerant of severe cold whilst in a wide range of climates mild frost is experienced by eucalypts they in general only tolerate light frosts down to −5c  23f 4 18 19 the hardiest are the snow gums such as eucalyptus pauciflora which is capable of withstanding cold and frost down to about −20c −4f two subspecies e pauciflora subsp niphophila and e pauciflora subsp debeuzevillei in particular are even hardier and can tolerate even quite severe winters several other species especially from the high plateau and mountains of central tasmania such as eucalyptus coccifera eucalyptus subcrenulata and eucalyptus gunnii 20 have also produced extreme cold-hardy forms and it is seed procured from these genetically hardy strains that are planted for ornament in colder parts of the world animal relationshipsedit an essential oil extracted from eucalyptus leaves contains compounds that are powerful natural disinfectants and can be toxic in large quantities several marsupial herbivores notably koalas and some possums are relatively tolerant of it the close correlation of these oils with other more potent toxins called formylated phloroglucinol compounds euglobals macrocarpals and sideroxylonals 21 allows koalas and other marsupial species to make food choices based on the smell of the leaves for koalas these compounds are the most important factor in leaf choice eucalyptus flowers produce a great abundance of nectar providing food for many pollinators including insects birds bats and possums although eucalyptus trees are seemingly well-defended from herbivores by the oils and phenolic compounds they have insect pests these include the eucalyptus longhorn borer phoracantha semipunctata and the aphid-like psyllids known as bell lerps both of which have become established as pests throughout the world wherever eucalypts are cultivated the eusocial beetle austroplatypus incompertus makes and defends its galleries exclusively inside eucalyptus plants adaptation to fireedit eucalypts originated between 35 and 50 million years ago not long after australia-new guinea separated from gondwana their rise coinciding with an increase in fossil charcoal deposits suggesting that fire was a factor even then but they remained a minor component of the tertiary rainforest until about 20 million years ago when the gradual drying of the continent and depletion of soil nutrients led to the development of a more open forest type predominantly casuarina and acacia species the aridification of australia during the mid-tertiary period  25-40 million years ago combined with the annual penetration of tropical convection storms and associated lightning deep into the continental interior stimulated the gradual evolution diversification and geographic expansion of the flammable biota the absence of great rivers or mountain chains meant that there were no geographic barriers to check the spread of fires from the monsoonal cradle fire-promoting species expanded into higher rainfall environments where lightning was less frequent gradually displacing the gondwanan rainforest from all but the most fire-sheltered habitats 22 the two valuable timber trees alpine ash e delegatensis and australian mountain ash e regnans are killed by fire and only regenerate from seed the same 2003 bushfire that had little impact on forests around canberra resulted in thousands of hectares of dead ash forests however a small amount of ash survived and put out new ash trees as well there has been some debate as to whether to leave the stands or attempt to harvest the mostly undamaged timber which is increasingly recognised as a damaging practice hazardsedit the two most common hazards of eucalyptus species to people are fire and falling branches fire hazardedit eucalyptus oil is highly flammable ignited trees have been known to explode 9 23 bushfires can travel easily through the oil-rich air of the tree crowns 24 25 eucalypts obtain long-term fire survivability from their ability to regenerate from epicormic buds situated deep within their thick bark or from lignotubers 26 or by producing serotinous fruits in seasonally dry climates oaks are often fire-resistant particularly in open grasslands as a grass fire is insufficient to ignite the scattered trees in contrast a eucalyptus forest tends to promote fire because of the volatile and highly combustible oils produced by the leaves as well as the production of large amounts of litter which is high in phenolics preventing its breakdown by fungi and thus accumulates as large amounts of dry combustible fuel 26 consequently dense eucalypt plantings may be subject to catastrophic firestorms in fact almost thirty years before the oakland firestorm of 1991 a study of eucalyptus in the area warned that the litter beneath the trees builds up very rapidly and should be regularly monitored and removed 27 it has been estimated that 70 of the energy released through the combustion of vegetation in the oakland fire was due to eucalyptus 28 in a national park service study it was found that the fuel load in tons per acre of non-native eucalyptus woods is almost three times as great as native oak woodland 28 falling branchesedit some species of gum trees drop branches unexpectedly in australia parks victoria warns campers not to camp under river red gums 29 some councils in australia such as gosnells western australia have removed eucalypts after reports of damage from dropped branches even in the face of lengthy well publicised protests to protect particular trees 30 a former australian national botanic gardens director and consulting arborist robert boden has been quoted referring to summer branch drop 31 dropping of branches is recognised in australia literature through the fictional death of judy in seven little australians although all large trees can drop branches the weight of eucalyptus wood is high because of its density and high resin contentcitation needed cultivation and usesedit eucalyptus was introduced from australia to the rest of the world following the cook expedition in 1770 collected by sir joseph banks botanist on the expedition it was subsequently introduced to many parts of the world notably california brazil ecuador colombia ethiopia morocco portugal south africa uganda israel galicia and chile on the order of 250 species are under cultivation in california 32 in portugal and also spain eucalypts have been planted in pulpwood plantations eucalyptus are the basis for several industries such as sawmilling pulp charcoal and others several species have become invasive and are causing major problems for local ecosystems mainly due to the absence of wildlife corridors and rotations management eucalypts have many uses which have made them economically important trees and have become a cash crop in poor areas such as timbuktu africa 7:22 and the peruvian andes 6 despite concerns that the trees are invasive in some countries like south africa 8 best-known are perhaps the varieties karri and yellow box due to their fast growth the foremost benefit of these trees is their wood they can be chopped off at the root and grow back again they provide many desirable characteristics for use as ornament timber firewood and pulpwood it is also used in a number of industries from fence posts and charcoal to cellulose extraction for biofuels fast growth also makes eucalypts suitable as windbreaks and to reduce erosion eucalypts draw a tremendous amount of water from the soil through the process of transpiration they have been planted or re-planted in some places to lower the water table and reduce soil salination eucalypts have also been used as a way of reducing malaria by draining the soil in algeria lebanon sicily 33 elsewhere in europe in caucasus western georgia and california 34 drainage removes swamps which provide a habitat for mosquito larvae but can also destroy ecologically productive areas this drainage is not limited to the soil surface because the eucalyptus roots are up to 2.5m  8.2ft in length and can depending on the location even reach the phreatic zonecitation needed pulpwoodedit eucalyptus is the most common short fibre source for pulpwood to make pulp 35 eucalyptus globulus in temperate climates and the hybrid of eucalyptus urophylla x eucalyptus grandis in tropical climates are the most used varieties in papermakingcitation needed the fibre length of eucalyptus is relatively short and uniform with low coarseness compared with other hardwoods commonly used as pulpwood the fibres are slender yet relatively thick walled this gives uniform paper formation and high opacity that are important for all types of fine papers the low coarseness is important for high quality coated papers 35 eucalyptus is suitable for many tissue papers as the short and slender fibres gives a high number of fibres per gram and low coarseness contributes to softness 35 eucalyptus oiledit eucalyptus oil is readily steam distilled from the leaves and can be used for cleaning and as an industrial solvent as an antiseptic for deodorising and in very small quantities in food supplements especially sweets cough drops toothpaste and decongestants it has insect repellent properties jahn 1991 a b 1992 and is an active ingredient in some commercial mosquito repellents fradin  day 2002 eucalyptus globulus is the principal source of eucalyptus oil worldwide honeyedit the nectar of some eucalypts produces high-quality monofloral honey musical instrumentsedit eucalypt wood is also commonly used to make didgeridoos a traditional australian aboriginal wind instrument the trunk of the tree is hollowed out by termites and then cut down if the bore is of the correct size and shape dyesedit all parts of eucalyptus may be used to make dyes that are substantive on protein fibres such as silk and wool simply by processing the plant part with water colours to be achieved range from yellow and orange through green tan chocolate and deep rust red 36 the material remaining after processing can be safely used as mulch or fertilisercitation needed prospectingedit eucalyptus trees in the australian outback draw up gold from tens of meters underground through their root system and deposit it as particles in their leaves and branches a maia detector for x-ray elemental imaging at the australian synchrotron clearly showed deposits of gold and other metals in the structure of eucalyptus leaves from the kalgoorlie region of western australia that would have been untraceable using other methods the microscopic leaf-bound nuggets are not worth collecting themselves but may provide an environmentally benign way of locating subsurface mineral deposits 37 eucalyptus as plantation speciesedit in the 20th century scientists around the world experimented with eucalyptus species they hoped to grow them in the tropics but most experimental results failed until breakthroughs in the 1960s-1980s in species selection silviculture and breeding programs unlocked the potential of eucalypts in the tropics prior to then as brett bennett noted in a 2010 article eucalypts were something of the el dorado of forestry today eucalyptus is the most widely planted type of tree in plantations around the world 38 in south america mainly in brazil argentina paraguay and uruguay south africa australia india galicia and many more 39 north americaedit california in the 1850s eucalyptus trees were introduced to california by australians during the california gold rush much of california has a similar climate to parts of australia by the early 1900s thousands of acres of eucalypts were planted with the encouragement of the state government it was hoped that they would provide a renewable source of timber for construction furniture making and railroad ties it was soon found that for the latter purpose eucalyptus was particularly unsuitable as the ties made from eucalyptus had a tendency to twist while drying and the dried ties were so tough that it was nearly impossible to hammer rail spikes into them they went on to note that the promise of eucalyptus in california was based on the old virgin forests of australia this was a mistake as the young trees being harvested in california could not compare in quality to the centuries-old eucalyptus timber of australia it reacted differently to harvest the older trees didnt split or warp as the infant california crop did there was a vast difference between the two and this would doom the california eucalyptus industry 40 one way in which the eucalyptus mainly the blue gum e globulus proved valuable in california was in providing windbreaks for highways orange groves and other farms in the mostly treeless central part of the state they are also admired as shade and ornamental trees in many cities and gardens eucalyptus plantations in california have been criticised because they compete with native plants and do not support native animals fire is also a problem the 1991 oakland hills firestorm which destroyed almost 3,000 homes and killed 25 people was partly fuelled by large numbers of eucalypts close to the houses 41 in some parts of california eucalypt plantations are being removed and native trees and plants restored individuals have also illegally destroyed some trees and are suspected of introducing insect pests from australia which attack the trees 42 eucalyptus trees also grow in parts of the pacific northwest washington oregon and parts of british columbia south americaedit uruguay antonio lussich introduced eucalyptus into uruguay in approximately 1896 throughout what is now maldonado department and it has spread all over the south-eastern and eastern coast there had been no trees in the area because it consisted of dry sand dunes and stones lussich also introduced many other trees particularly acacia and pines but they have not expanded so massively uruguayan forestry crops using eucalyptus species have been promoted since 1989 when the new national forestry law established that 20 of the national territory would be dedicated to forestry as the main landscape of uruguay is grassland  140,000km2 87 of the national territory most of the forestry plantations would be established in prairie regions 43 44 45 the planting of eucalyptus sp has been criticised because of concerns that soil would be degraded by nutrient depletion and other biological changes 44 45 46 during the last ten years in the northwestern regions of uruguay the eucalyptus sp plantations have reached annual forestation rates of 300 that zone has a potential forested area of 1,000,000 hectares approximately 29 of the national territory dedicated to forestry of which approximately 800,000 hectares are currently forested by monoculture of eucalyptus spp 47 it is expected that the radical and durable substitution of vegetation cover leads to changes in the quantity and quality of soil organic matter such changes may also influence soil fertility and soil physical and chemical properties the soil quality effects associated with eucalyptus sp plantations could have negative effects on soil chemistry 46 48 49 for example soil acidification 50 51 52 iron leaching allelopathic activities 51 and a high cn ratio of litter 48 53 54 55 additionally as most scientific understanding of land cover change effects is related to ecosystems where forests were replaced by grasslands or crops or grassland was replaced by crops the environmental effects of the current uruguayan land cover changes are not well understood 56 the first scientific publication on soil studies in western zone tree plantations focused on pulp production appeared in 2004 and described soil acidification and soil carbon changes 57 similar to a podzolisation process and destruction of clay illite-like minerals which is the main reservoir of potassium in the soil 58 although these studies were carried out in an important zone for forest cultivation they cannot define the current situation in the rest of the land area under eucalyptus cultivation moreover recently jackson and jobbagy have proposed another adverse environmental impact that may result from eucalyptus culture on prairie soils stream acidification 59 the eucalyptus species most planted are e grandis e globulus and e dunnii they are used mainly for pulp mills approximately 80,000 ha of e grandis situated in the departments of rivera tacuarembó and paysandú is primarily earmarked for the solid wood market although a portion of it is used for sawlogs and plywood the current area under commercial forest plantation is 6 of the total the main uses of the wood produced are elemental chlorine free pulp mill production for cellulose and paper sawlogs plywood and bioenergy thermoelectric generation most of the products obtained from sawmills and pulp mills as well as plywood and logs are exported this has raised the income of this sector with respect to traditional products from other sectors uruguayan forestry plantations have rates of growth of 30 cubic metres per hectare per year and commercial harvesting occurs after 9 years brazil eucalyptus was introduced to brazil in 1910 for timber substitution and the charcoal industry it has thrived in the local environment and today there are around 7 million hectares planted the wood is highly valued by the charcoal and pulp and paper industries the short rotation allows a larger wood production and supplies wood for several other activities helping to preserve the native forests from logging when well managed the plantation soils can sustain endless replanting eucalyptus plantings are also used as wind breaks brazils plantations have world-record rates of growth typically over 40 cubic metres per hectare per year 60 and commercial harvesting occurs after years 5 due to continual development and governmental funding year-on-year growth is consistently being improved eucalyptus can produce up to 100 cubic metres per hectare per year brazil has become the top exporter and producer of eucalyptus round wood and pulp and has played an important role in developing the australian market through the countrysclarification needed committed research in this area the local iron producers in brazil rely heavily on sustainably grown eucalyptus for charcoal this has greatly pushed up the price of charcoal in recent years the plantations are generally owned and operated for national and international industry by timber asset companies such as thomson forestry greenwood management or cellulose producers such as aracruz cellulose and stora enso overall south america is expected to produce 55 of the worlds eucalyptus round-wood by 2010 many environmental ngos have criticised the use of exotic tree species for forestry in latin america 61 africaedit ethiopia eucalyptus was introduced to ethiopia in either 1894 or 1895 either by emperor menelik iis french advisor mondon-vidailhet or by the englishman captain obrian menelik ii endorsed its planting around his new capital city of addis ababa because of the massive deforestation around the city for firewood according to richard rk pankhurst the great advantage of the eucalypts was that they were fast growing required little attention and when cut down grew up again from the roots it could be harvested every ten years the tree proved successful from the onset 62 plantations of eucalypts spread from the capital to other growing urban centres such as debre marqos pankhurst reports that the most common species found in addis ababa in the mid-1960s was e globulus although he also found e melliodora and e rostrata in significant numbers david buxton writing of central ethiopia in the mid-1940s observed that eucalyptus trees have become an integral -- and a pleasing -- element in the shoan landscape and has largely displaced the slow-growing native cedar juniperus procera 63 it was commonly believed that the thirst of the eucalyptus tended to dry up rivers and wells creating such opposition to the species that in 1913 a proclamation was issued ordering a partial destruction of all standing trees and their replacement with mulberry trees pankhurst reports the proclamation however remained a dead letter there is no evidence of eucalypts being uprooted still less of mulberry trees being planted 64 eucalypts remain a defining feature of addis ababa madagascar much of madagascars original native forest has been replaced with eucalyptus threatening biodiversity by isolating remaining natural areas such as andasibe-mantadia national park south africa numerous eucalyptus species have been introduced into south africa mainly for timber and firewood but also for ornamental purposes they are popular with beekeepers for the honey they provide 65 however in south africa they are considered invasive with their water-sucking capabilities threatening water supplies they also release a chemical into the surrounding soil which kills native competitors 8 eucalyptus seedlings are usually unable to compete with the indigenous grasses but after a fire when the grass cover has been removed a seed-bed may be created the following eucalyptus species have been able to become naturalised in south africa e camaldulensis e cladocalyx e diversicolor e grandis and e lehmannii 65 zimbabwe as in south africa many eucalyptus species have been introduced into zimbabwe mainly for timber and firewood and e robusta and e tereticornis have been recorded as having become naturalised there 65 europeedit in continental portugal the azores and the north of spain especially in the provinces of cantabria vizcaya asturias and galicia farmland has been replaced with eucalypt plantations in italy the eucalyptus only arrived at the turn of the 19th century and large scale plantations were started at the beginning of the 20th century with the aim of drying up swampy ground to defeat malariacitation needed this their rapid growth in the italian climate and excellent function as windbreaks has made them a common sight in the south of the country including the islands of sardinia and sicilycitation needed they are also valued for the characteristic smelling and tasting honey that is produced from them the variety of eucalyptus most commonly found in italy is e camaldulensis 66 in greece eucalyptus is widely found especially in southern greece and crete it is cultivated and used for various purposes including as an ingredient in pharmaceutical products eg creams elixirs and sprays and for leather production it was imported in 1862 by botanist theodoros georgios orphanides the principal species is eucalyptus globulus eucalyptus has been grown in ireland since trials in the 1930s and now grows wild in south western ireland in the mild climate asiaedit eucalyptus seeds of the species e globulus were imported into palestine in the 1860s but did not acclimatise well 67 later e camaldulensis was introduced more successfully and it is still a very common tree in israel 67 the use of eucalyptus trees to drain swampy land was a common practice in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries 67 68 the german templer colony of sarona had begun planting eucalyptus for this purpose by 1874 though it is not known where the seeds came from 69 many zionist colonies also adopted the practice in the following years under the guidance of the mikveh israel agricultural school 67 68 in india the institute of forest genetics and tree breeding coimbatore started a eucalyptus breeding program in the 1990s the organisation released four varieties of conventionally bred high yielding and genetically improved clones for commercial and research interests in 2010 70 71 72 eucalyptus trees were introduced to sri lanka in the late 19th century by tea and coffee planters for wind protection shade and fuel forestry replanting of eucalyptus began in the 1930s in deforested mountain areas and currently there are about 10 species present in the island they account for 20 of major reforestation plantings they provide railway sleepers utility poles sawn timber and fuelwood but are controversial because of their adverse effect on biodiversity hydrology and soil fertility they are associated with another invasive species the eucalyptus gall wasp leptocybe invasa 73 74 pacific islandsedit hawaii some 90 species of eucalyptus have been introduced to the islands where they have displaced some native species due to their higher maximum height fast growth and lower water needs particularly noticeable is the rainbow eucalyptus eucalyptus deglupta native to indonesia and the philippines whose bark falls off to reveal a trunk that can be green red orange yellow pink and purple 75 nonnative eucalyptus and biodiversityedit due to similar favourable climatic conditions eucalyptus plantations have often replaced oak woodlands for example in california spain and portugal the resulting monocultures have raised concerns about loss of biological diversity through loss of acorns that mammals and birds feed on absence of hollows that in oak trees provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and small mammals and for bee colonies as well as lack of downed trees in managed plantations a study of the relationship between birds and eucalyptus in the san francisco bay area found that bird diversity was similar in native forest vs eucalyptus forest but the species were different 76 one way in which the avifauna changes is that cavity nesting birds including woodpeckers owls chickadees wood ducks etc are depauperate in eucalyptus groves because the decay-resistant wood of these trees prevents cavity formation by decay or excavation also those bird species that glean insects from foliage such as warblers and vireos have population declines when eucalyptus replace oak forest birds that do well in eucalyptus groves in california like tall vertical habitat like herons and egrets possibly because redwood trees are less available or have longer bills which may play a role in preventing their nostrils from being clogged by eucalyptus resinpitch 77 the point reyes bird observatory observes that sometimes short-billed birds like the ruby-crowned kinglet are found dead beneath eucalyptus trees with their nostrils clogged with pitch 28 monarch butterflies use eucalyptus in california for over-wintering but in some locations have a preference for monterey pines 28 historyedit although eucalypts must have been seen by the very early european explorers and collectors no botanical collections of them are known to have been made until 1770 when joseph banks and daniel solander arrived at botany bay with captain james cook there they collected specimens of e gummifera and later near the endeavour river in northern queensland e platyphylla neither of these species was named as such at the time in 1777 on cooks third expedition david nelson collected a eucalypt on bruny island in southern tasmania this specimen was taken to the british museum in london and was named eucalyptus obliqua by the french botanist lhéritier who was working in london at the time 78 he coined the generic name from the greek roots eu and calyptos meaning well and covered in reference to the operculum of the flower bud which protects the developing flower parts as the flower develops and is shed by the pressure of the emerging stamens at flowering it was most likely an accident that lheritier chose a feature common to all eucalypts the name obliqua was derived from the latin obliquus meaning oblique which is the botanical term describing a leaf base where the two sides of the leaf blade are of unequal length and do not meet the petiole at the same place e obliqua was published in 1788-89 which coincided with the first official european settlement of australia between then and the turn of the 19th century several more species of eucalyptus were named and published most of these were by the english botanist james edward smith and most were as might be expected trees of the sydney region these include the economically valuable e pilularis e saligna and e tereticornis the first endemic western australian eucalyptus to be collected and subsequently named was the yate e cornuta by the french botanist jacques labillardière who collected in what is now the esperance area in 1792 11 several australian botanists were active during the 19th century particularly ferdinand von mueller whose work on eucalypts contributed greatly to the first comprehensive account of the genus in george benthams flora australiensis in 1867 the account is the most important early systematic treatment of the genus bentham divided it into five series whose distinctions were based on characteristics of the stamens particularly the anthers mueller 1879–84 work elaborated by joseph henry maiden  1903–33 and still further by william faris blakely  1934 the anther system became too complex to be workable and more recent systematic work has concentrated on the characteristics of buds fruits leaves and bark photo galleryedit eucalyptus sideroxylon showing fruit capsules and buds
