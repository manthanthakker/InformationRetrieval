rocky mountain institute rocky mountain institute rmi is an organization in the united states dedicated to research publication consulting and lecturing in the general field of sustainability with a special focus on profitable innovations for energy and resource efficiency rmi was established in 1982 and has grown into a broad-based institution with 150 staff and an annual budget of some $30 million 1 rmis work is independent and non-adversarial with a strong emphasis on market-based solutions the institute including recently merged carbon war room operates across 9 different initiative areas shipping efficiency sunshine for mines smart island economies reinventing fire china mobility transformation trucking efficiency sustainable aviation buildings electricity platform and renewable solutions 2 the work of rmi has benefited more than 80 fortune 500 companies in a diverse range of sectors 3 rmi is headquartered in basalt colorado and also maintains offices in boulder colorado new

published many books consulted widely and was active in energy affairs in some fifteen countries as synthesist and lobbyist lovins is a main theorist of the soft energy path later in 1979 lovins married l hunter sheldon a lawyer forester and social scientist hunter received her undergraduate degree in sociology and political studies from pitzer college and her jd from loyola marymounts school of law in 1982 amory and hunter founded rocky mountain institute based in colorado together with a group of colleagues the lovinses fostered efficient resource use and policy development that they believed would promote global security rmi ultimately grew into an organization with a staff of around fifty by the mid 1980s the lovinses were being featured on major network tv programs such as 60 minutes at rmis headquarters the south-facing building complex is so energy-efficient that even with local -40f -40c winter temperatures the building interiors can maintain a comfortable temperature solely from the sunlight admitted plus the body heat of the people who work there the environment can actually nurture semi-tropical and tropical indoor plants the lovinses described the hard energy path as involving inefficient liquid-fuel automotive transport as well as giant centralized electricity-generating facilities often burning fossil fuels such as coal or petroleum or harnessing a fission reaction greatly complicated by electricity wastage and loss the soft energy path which they wholly preferred involves efficient use of energy diversity of energy production methods and matched in scale and quality to end uses and special reliance on soft technologies alternative technology such as solar wind biofuels and geothermal according to the institute large-scale electricity production facilities had an important place but it was a place that they were already filling in the middle 1970s in general more would not be needed in a 1989 speech amory lovins introduced the related concept of negawatt power in which the creation of a market for trading increased efficiency could supply additional electrical energy to consumers without increasing generation capacitysuch as building more power plants in recent years rmi has convened a team of designers and engineers to develop a super-efficient prototype automobile which theyve dubbed the hypercar in december 2014 rmi merged with carbon war room an organization with similar goals but a different approach 4 electric vehiclesedit in january 2008 led by john e waters bright automotive launched from rmi with the goal of building on the work of a consortium of organizations including alcoa googleorg johnson controls and the turner foundation 5 6 the bright idea is a brand new 100 miles per us gallon  2.4l/100km
