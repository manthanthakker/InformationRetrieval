ocean thermal energy conversion ocean thermal energy conversion otec uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer shallow or surface seawaters to run a heat engine and produce useful work usually in the form of electricity otec is a base load electricity generation system among ocean energy sources otec is one of the continuously available renewable energy resources that could contribute to base-load power supply 1 the resource potential for otec is considered to be much larger than for other ocean energy forms world energy council 2000 up to 88,000 twhyr of power could be generated from otec without affecting the oceans thermal structure pelc and fujita 2002 systems may be either closed-cycle or open-cycle closed-cycle otec uses working fluids that are typically thought of as refrigerants such as ammonia or r-134a these fluids have low boiling points and are therefore suitable for powering the systems generator to generate electricity the most commonly used heat cycle for otec to date is the rankine cycle using a low-pressure turbine open-cycle engines use vapour from the seawater itself as the working fluid otec can also supply quantities of cold water as a by-product this can be used for air conditioning and refrigeration and the nutrient-rich deep ocean water can feed biological technologies another by-product is fresh water distilled from the sea 2 otec theory was first developed in the 1880s and the first bench size demonstration model was constructed in 1926 currently the worlds only operating otec plant is in japan overseen by saga

parasitic power consumption by exhaust compressor  historyedit attempts to develop and refine otec technology started in the 1880s in 1881 jacques arsene darsonval a french physicist proposed tapping the thermal energy of the ocean darsonvals student georges claude built the first otec plant in matanzas cuba in 1930 3 4 the system generated 22 kw of electricity with a low-pressure turbine 5 the plant was later destroyed in a storm 6 in 1935 claude constructed a plant aboard a 10,000-ton cargo vessel moored off the coast of brazil weather and waves destroyed it before it could generate net power 5 net power is the amount of power generated after subtracting power needed to run the system in 1956 french scientists designed a 3 mw plant for abidjan ivory coast the plant was never completed because new finds of large amounts of cheap petroleum made it uneconomical 5 in 1962 j hilbert anderson and james h anderson jr focused on increasing component efficiency they patented their new closed cycle design in 1967 7 this design improved upon the original closed-cycle rankine system and included this in an outline for a plant that would produce power at lower cost than oil or coal at the time however their research garnered little attention since coal and nuclear were considered the future of energy 6 japan is a major contributor to the development of otec technology 8 beginning in 1970 the tokyo electric power company successfully built and deployed a 100kw closed-cycle otec plant on the island of nauru 8 the plant became operational on 14 october 1981 producing about 120kw of electricity 90kw was used to power the plant and the remaining electricity was used to power a school and other places 5 this set a world record for power output from an otec system where the power was sent to a real as opposed to an experimental power grid 9 1981 also saw a major development in otec technology when russian engineer dr alexander kalina used a mixture of ammonia and water to produce electricity this new ammonia-water mixture greatly improved the efficiency of the power cycle in 1994 saga university designed and constructed a 4.5kw plant for the purpose of testing a newly invented uehara cycle also named after its inventor haruo uehara this cycle included absorption and extraction processes that allow this system to outperform the kalina cycle by 1-2 10 currently the institute of ocean energy saga university is the leader in otec power plant research and also focuses on many of the technologys secondary benefits the 1970s saw an uptick in otec research and development during the post 1973 arab-israeli war which caused oil prices to triple the us federal government poured $260 million into otec research after president carter signed a law that committed the us to a production goal of 10,000 mw of electricity from otec systems by 1999 11 in 1974 the us established the natural energy laboratory of hawaii authority nelha at keahole point on the kona coast of hawaii hawaii is the best us otec location due to its warm surface water access to very deep very cold water and high electricity costs the laboratory has become a leading test facility for otec technology 12 in the same year lockheed received a grant from the us national science foundation to study otec this eventually led to an effort by lockheed the us navy makai ocean engineering dillingham construction and other firms to build the worlds first and only net-power producing otec plant dubbed mini-otec 13 for three months in 1979 a small amount of electricity was generated research related to making open-cycle otec a reality began earnestly in 1979 at the solar energy research institute seri with funding from the us department of energy evaporators and suitably configured direct-contact condensers were developed and patented by seri see  14 15 16 an original design for a power-producing experiment then called the 165-kw experiment was described by kreith and bharathan  17 and  18  as the max jacob memorial award lecture the initial design used two parallel axial turbines using last stage rotors taken from large steam turbines later a team led by dr bharathan at the national renewable energy laboratory nrel developed the initial conceptual design for up-dated 210kw open-cycle otec experiment  19 this design integrated all components of the cycle namely the evaporator condenser and the turbine into one single vacuum vessel with the turbine mounted on top to prevent any potential for water to reach it the vessel was made of concrete as the first process vacuum vessel of its kind attempts to make all components using low-cost plastic material could not be fully achieved as some conservatism was required for the turbine and the vacuum pumps developed as the first of their kind later dr bharathan worked with a team of engineers at the pacific institute for high technology research pichtr to further pursue this design through preliminary and final stages it was renamed the net power producing experiment nppe and was constructed at the natural energy laboratory of hawaii nelh by pichtr by a team led by chief engineer don evans and the project was managed by dr luis vega in 2002 india tested a 1 mw floating otec pilot plant near tamil nadu the plant was ultimately unsuccessful due to a failure of the deep sea cold water pipe 20 its government continues to sponsor research 21 in 2006 makai ocean engineering was awarded a contract from the us office of naval research onr to investigate the potential for otec to produce nationally-significant quantities of hydrogen in at-sea floating plants located in warm tropical waters realizing the need for larger partners to actually commercialize otec makai approached lockheed martin to renew their previous relationship and determine if the time was ready for otec and so in 2007 lockheed martin resumed work in otec and became a subcontractor to makai to support their sbir which was followed by other subsequent collaborations 13 in march 2011 ocean thermal energy corporation signed an energy services agreement esa with the baha mar resort nassau bahamas for the worlds first and largest seawater air conditioning swac system 22 in june 2015 the project was put on pause while the resort resolved financial and ownership issues 23 in august 2016 it was announced that the issues had been resolved and that the resort would open in march 2017 24 it is expected that the swac systems construction will resume at that time in july 2011 makai ocean engineering completed the design and construction of an otec heat exchanger test facility at the natural energy laboratory of hawaii the purpose of the facility is to arrive at an optimal design for otec heat exchangers increasing performance and useful life while reducing cost heat exchangers being the #1 cost driver for an otec plant 25 and in march 2013 makai announced an award to install and operate a 100 kilowatt turbine on the otec heat exchanger test facility and once again connect otec power to the grid 26 27 in july 2016 the virgin islands public services commission approved ocean thermal energy corporations application to become a qualified facility the company is thus permitted to begin negotiations with the virgin islands water and power authority wapa for a power purchase agreement ppa pertaining to an ocean thermal energy conversion otec plant on the island of st croix this would be the worlds first commercial otec plant 28 29 currently operating otec plantsedit in march 2013 saga university with various japanese industries completed the installation of a new otec plant okinawa prefecture announced the start of the otec operation testing at kume island on april 15 2013 the main aim is to prove the validity of computer models and demonstrate otec to the public the testing and research will be conducted with the support of saga university until the end of fy 2016 ihi plant construction co ltd yokogawa electric corporation and xenesys inc were entrusted with constructing the 100 kilowatt class plant within the grounds of the okinawa prefecture deep sea water research center the location was specifically chosen in order to utilize existing deep seawater and surface seawater intake pipes installed for the research center in 2000 the pipe is used for the intake of deep sea water for research fishery and agricultural use 19 the plant consists of two units one includes the 50kw generator while the second unit is used for component testing and optimization 30 the otec facility and deep seawater research center are open to free public tours by appointment in english and japanese 31 currently this is the only fully operational otec plant in the world in 2011 makai ocean engineering completed a heat exchanger test facility at nelha used to test a variety of heat exchange technologies for use in otec makai has received funding to install a 105kw turbine 32 installation will make this facility the largest operational otec facility though the record for largest power will remain with the open cycle plant also developed in hawaii in july 2014 dcns group partnered with akuo energy announced ner 300 funding for their nemo project if successful the 16mw gross 10mw net offshore plant will be the largest otec facility to date dcns plans to have nemo operational by 2020 33 an ocean thermal energy conversion power plant built by makai ocean engineering went operational in hawaii in august 2015  the governor of hawaii david ige flipped the switch to activate the plant this is the first true closed-cycle ocean thermal energy conversion otec plant to be connected to a us electrical grid  it is a demo plant capable of generating 105 kilowatts enough to power about 120 homes 34 thermodynamic efficiencyedit a heat engine gives greater efficiency when run with a large temperature difference in the oceans the temperature difference between surface and deep water is greatest in the tropics although still a modest 20 to 25c it is therefore in the tropics that otec offers the greatest possibilities 2 otec has the potential to offer global amounts of energy that are 10 to 100 times greater than other ocean energy options such as wave powercitation needed otec plants can operate continuously providing a base load supply for an electrical power generation system 2 the main technical challenge of otec is to generate significant amounts of power efficiently from small temperature differences it is still considered an emerging technology early otec systems were 1 to 3 percent thermally efficient well below the theoretical maximum 6 and 7 percent for this temperature difference 35 modern designs allow performance approaching the theoretical maximum carnot efficiency cycle typesedit cold seawater is an integral part of each of the three types of otec systems closed-cycle open-cycle and hybrid to operate the cold seawater must be brought to the surface the primary approaches are active pumping and desalination desalinating seawater near the sea floor lowers its density which causes it to rise to the surface 36 the alternative to costly pipes to bring condensing cold water to the surface is to pump vaporized low boiling point fluid into the depths to be condensed thus reducing pumping volumes and reducing technical and environmental problems and lowering costscitation needed closededit closed-cycle systems use fluid with a low boiling point such as ammonia having a boiling point around -33c at atmospheric pressure to power a turbine to generate electricity warm surface seawater is pumped through a heat exchanger to vaporize the fluid the expanding vapor turns the turbo-generator cold water pumped through a second heat exchanger condenses the vapor into a liquid which is then recycled through the system in 1979 the natural energy laboratory and several private-sector partners developed the mini otec experiment which achieved the first successful at-sea production of net electrical power from closed-cycle otec 37 the mini otec vessel was moored 1.5 miles  2.4km off the hawaiian coast and produced enough net electricity to illuminate the ships light bulbs and run its computers and television openedit open-cycle otec uses warm surface water directly to make electricity the warm seawater is first pumped into a low-pressure container which causes it to boil in some schemes the expanding vapour drives a low-pressure turbine attached to an electrical generator the vapour which has left its salt and other contaminants in the low-pressure container is pure fresh water it is condensed into a liquid by exposure to cold temperatures from deep-ocean water this method produces desalinized fresh water suitable for drinking water irrigation or aquaculture 38 in other schemes the rising vapour is used in a gas lift technique of lifting water to significant heights depending on the embodiment such vapour lift pump techniques generate power from a hydroelectric turbine either before or after the pump is used 39 in 1984 the solar energy research institute now known as the national renewable energy laboratory developed a vertical-spout evaporator to convert warm seawater into low-pressure steam for open-cycle plants conversion efficiencies were as high as 97 for seawater-to-steam conversion overall steam production would only be a few percent of the incoming water in may 1993 an open-cycle otec plant at keahole point hawaii produced close to 80 kw of electricity during a net power-producing experiment 40 this broke the record of 40kw set by a japanese system in 1982 40 hybridedit a hybrid cycle combines the features of the closed- and open-cycle systems in a hybrid warm seawater enters a vacuum chamber and is flash-evaporated similar to the open-cycle evaporation process the steam vaporizes the ammonia working fluid of a closed-cycle loop on the other side of an ammonia vaporizer the vaporized fluid then drives a turbine to produce electricity the steam condenses within the heat exchanger and provides desalinated water see heat pipecitation needed working fluidsedit a popular choice of working fluid is ammonia which has superior transport properties easy availability and low cost ammonia however is toxic and flammable fluorinated carbons such as cfcs and hcfcs are not toxic or flammable but they contribute to ozone layer depletion hydrocarbons too are good candidates but they are highly flammable in addition this would create competition for use of them directly as fuels the power plant size is dependent upon the vapor pressure of the working fluid with increasing vapor pressure the size of the turbine and heat exchangers decreases while the wall thickness of the pipe and heat exchangers increase to endure high pressure especially on the evaporator side land shelf and floating sitesedit otec has the potential to produce gigawatts of electrical power and in conjunction with electrolysis could produce enough hydrogen to completely replace all projected global fossil fuel consumptioncitation needed reducing costs remains an unsolved challenge however otec plants require a long large diameter intake pipe which is submerged a kilometer or more into the oceans depths to bring cold water to the surface land-basededit land-based and near-shore facilities offer three main advantages over those located in deep water plants constructed on or near land do not require sophisticated mooring lengthy power cables or the more extensive maintenance associated with open-ocean environments they can be installed in sheltered areas so that they are relatively safe from storms and heavy seas electricity desalinated water and cold nutrient-rich seawater could be transmitted from near-shore facilities via trestle bridges or causeways in addition land-based or near-shore sites allow plants to operate with related industries such as mariculture or those that require desalinated water favored locations include those with narrow shelves volcanic islands steep  15-20 degrees offshore slopes and relatively smooth sea floors these sites minimize the length of the intake pipe a land-based plant could be built well inland from the shore offering more protection from storms or on the beach where the pipes would be shorter in either case easy access for construction and operation helps lower costs land-based or near-shore sites can also support mariculture or chilled water agriculture tanks or lagoons built on shore allow workers to monitor and control miniature marine environments mariculture products can be delivered to market via standard transport one disadvantage of land-based facilities arises from the turbulent wave action in the surf zone otec discharge pipes should be placed in protective trenches to prevent subjecting them to extreme stress during storms and prolonged periods of heavy seas also the mixed discharge of cold and warm seawater may need to be carried several hundred meters offshore to reach the proper depth before it is released requiring additional expense in construction and maintenance one way that otec systems can avoid some of the problems and expenses of operating in a surf zone is by building them just offshore in waters ranging from 10 to 30 meters deep ocean thermal corporation 1984 this type of plant would use shorter and therefore less costly intake and discharge pipes which would avoid the dangers of turbulent surf the plant itself however would require protection from the marine environment such as breakwaters and erosion-resistant foundations and the plant output would need to be transmitted to shore 41 shelf basededit to avoid the turbulent surf zone as well as to move closer to the cold-water resource otec plants can be mounted to the continental shelf at depths up to 100 meters  330ft a shelf-mounted plant could be towed to the site and affixed to the sea bottom this type of construction is already used for offshore oil rigs the complexities of operating an otec plant in deeper water may make them more expensive than land-based approaches problems include the stress of open-ocean conditions and more difficult product delivery addressing strong ocean currents and large waves adds engineering and construction expense platforms require extensive pilings to maintain a stable base power delivery can require long underwater cables to reach land for these reasons shelf-mounted plants are less attractive 41citation needed floatingedit floating otec facilities operate off-shore although potentially optimal for large systems floating facilities present several difficulties the difficulty of mooring plants in very deep water complicates power delivery cables attached to floating platforms are more susceptible to damage especially during storms cables at depths greater than 1000 meters are difficult to maintain and repair riser cables which connect the sea bed and the plant need to be constructed to resist entanglement 41citation needed as with shelf-mounted plants floating plants need a stable base for continuous operation major storms and heavy seas can break the vertically suspended cold-water pipe and interrupt warm water intake as well to help prevent these problems pipes can be made of flexible polyethylene attached to the bottom of the platform and gimballed with joints or collars pipes may need to be uncoupled from the plant to prevent storm damage as an alternative to a warm-water pipe surface water can be drawn directly into the platform however it is necessary to prevent the intake flow from being damaged or interrupted during violent motions caused by heavy seas 41citation needed connecting a floating plant to power delivery cables requires the plant to remain relatively stationary mooring is an acceptable method but current mooring technology is limited to depths of about 2,000 meters  6,600ft even at shallower depths the cost of mooring may be prohibitivecitation needed some proposed projectsedit otec projects under consideration include a small plant for the us navy base on the british overseas territory island of diego garcia in the indian ocean ocean thermal energy corporation formerly ocees international inc is working with the us navy on a design for a proposed 13-mw otec plant to replace the current diesel generators the otec plant would also provide 1.25 million gallonsclarification needed per day of potable water this project is currently waiting for changes in us military contract policies ote has proposed building a 10-mw otec plant on guam bahamasedit ocean thermal energy corporation ote currently has plans to install two 10 mw otec plants in the us virgin islands and a 5-10 mw otec facility in the bahamas ote has also designed the worlds largest seawater air conditioning swac plant for a resort in the bahamas which will use cold deep seawater as a method of air-conditioning 42 in mid-2015 the 95-complete project was temporarily put on hold while the resort resolved financial and ownership issues 43 in august 22 2016 the government of the bahamas announced that a new agreement had been signed under which the baha mar resort will be completed 44 on september 27 2016 bahamian prime minister perry christie announced that construction had resumed on baha mar and that the resort was slated to open in march 2017 45 ote expects to have the swac plant up and running within two years of baha mars opening hawaiiedit lockheed martins alternative energy development team has partnered with makai ocean engineering 46 to complete the final design phase of a 10-mw closed cycle otec pilot system which planned to become operational in hawaii in the 2012-2013 time frame this system was designed to expand to 100-mw commercial systems in the near future in november 2010 the us naval facilities engineering command navfac awarded lockheed martin a us$4.4 million contract modification to develop critical system components and designs for the plant adding to the 2009 $8.1 million contract and two department of energy grants totaling over $1 million in 2008 and march 2010 47 a small but operational ocean thermal energy conversion otec plant was inaugurated in hawaii in august 2015 the opening of the research and development 100-kilowatt facility marked the first time a closed-cycle otec plant was connected to the us grid 48 hainanedit on april 13 2013 lockheed contracted with the reignwood group to build a 10 megawatt plant off the coast of southern china to provide power for a planned resort on hainan island 49 a plant of that size would power several thousand homes 50 51 the reignwood group acquired opus offshore in 2011 which forms its reignwood ocean engineering division which also is engaged in development of deepwater drilling 52 japanedit currently the only continuously operating otec system is located in okinawa prefecture japan the governmental support local community support and advanced research carried out by saga university were key for the contractors ihi plant construction co ltd yokogawa electric corporation and xenesys inc to succeed with this project work is being conducted to develop a 1mw facility on kume island requiring new pipelines in july 2014 more than 50 members formed the global ocean resource and energy association gosea an international organization formed to promote the development of the kumejima model and work towards the installation of larger deep seawater pipelines and a 1mw otec facility 53 the companies involved in the current otec projects along with other interested parties have developed plans for offshore otec systems as well 54 - for more details see currently operating otec plants above united states virgin islandsedit on march 5 2014 ocean thermal energy corporation otec 55 and the 30th legislature of the united states virgin islands usvi signed a memorandum of understanding to move forward with a study to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits to the usvi of installing on-shore ocean thermal energy conversion otec renewable energy power plants and seawater air conditioning swac facilities 56 the benefits to be assessed in the usvi study include both the baseload  24/7 clean electricity generated by otec as well as the various related products associated with otec and swac including abundant fresh drinking water energy-saving air conditioning sustainable aquaculture and mariculture and agricultural enhancement projects for the islands of st thomas and st croix the honorable shawn-michael malone president of the usvi senate commented on his signing of the memorandum of understanding mou authorizing otes feasibility study the most fundamental duty of government is to protect the health and welfare of its citizens said senator malone these clean energy technologies have the potential to improve the air quality and environment for our residents and to provide the foundation for meaningful economic development therefore it is our duty as elected representatives to explore the feasibility and possible benefits of otec and swac for the people of usvi 57 on july 18 2016 otes application to be a qualifying facility was approved by the virgin islands public services commission 58 ote also received permission to begin negotiating contracts associated with this project 59 kiribatiedit south koreas research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso received approval in principal from bureau veritas for their 1mw offshore otec design no timeline was given for the project which will be located 6km offshore of the republic of kiribati 60 martiniqueedit akuo energy and dcns were awarded ner300 funding on july 8 2014 61 for their nemo new energy for martinique and overseas project which is expected to be a 10.7mw-net offshore facility completed in 2020 62 the award to help with development totaled 72 million euro 63 related activitiesedit otec has uses other than power production desalinationedit desalinated water can be produced in open- or hybrid-cycle plants using surface condensers to turn evaporated seawater into potable water system analysis indicates that a 2-megawatt plant could produce about 4,300 cubic metres  150,000cuft of desalinated water each day 64 another system patented by richard bailey creates condensate water by regulating deep ocean water flow through surface condensers correlating with fluctuating dew-point temperatures 65 this condensation system uses no incremental energy and has no moving parts on march 22 2015 saga university opened a flash-type desalination demonstration facility on kumejima 66 this satellite of their institute of ocean energy uses post-otec deep seawater from the okinawa otec demonstration facility and raw surface seawater to produce desalinated water air is extracted from the closed system with a vacuum pump when raw sea water is pumped into the flash chamber it boils allowing pure steam to rise and the salt and remaining seawater to be removed the steam is returned to liquid in a heat exchanger with cold post-otec deep seawater 67 the desalinated water can be used in hydrogen production or drinking water if minerals are added air conditioningedit the 41f  5c cold seawater made available by an otec system creates an opportunity to provide large amounts of cooling to industries and homes near the plant the water can be used in chilled-water coils to provide air-conditioning for buildings it is estimated that a pipe 1 foot  0.30m in diameter can deliver 4,700 gallons of water per minute water at 43f  6c could provide more than enough air-conditioning for a large building operating 8,000 hours per year in lieu of electrical conditioning selling for 5-10 per kilowatt-hour it would save $200,000-$400,000 in energy bills annually 68 the intercontinental resort and thalasso-spa on the island of bora bora uses an swac system to air-condition its buildings 69 the system passes seawater through a heat exchanger where it cools freshwater in a closed loop system this freshwater is then pumped to buildings and directly cools the air in 2010 copenhagen energy opened a district cooling plant in copenhagen denmark the plant delivers cold seawater to commercial and industrial buildings and has reduced electricity consumption by 80 percent 70 ocean thermal energy corporation ote has designed a 9800-ton sdc system for a vacation resort in the bahamas chilled-soil agricultureedit otec technology supports chilled-soil agriculture when cold seawater flows through underground pipes it chills the surrounding soil the temperature difference between roots in the cool soil and leaves in the warm air allows plants that evolved in temperate climates to be grown in the subtropics dr john p craven dr jack davidson and richard bailey patented this process and demonstrated it at a research facility at the natural energy laboratory of hawaii authority nelha 71 the research facility demonstrated that more than 100 different crops can be grown using this system many normally could not survive in hawaii or at keahole pointcitation needed japan has also been researching agricultural uses of deep sea water since 2000 at the okinawa deep sea water research institute on kume island the kume island facilities use regular water cooled by deep sea water in a heat exchanger run through pipes in the ground to cool soil their techniques have developed an important resource for the island community as they now produce spinach a winter vegetable commercially year round an expansion of the deep seawater agriculture facility was completed by kumejima town next to the otec demonstration facility in 2014 the new facility is for researching the economic practicality of chilled-soil agriculture on a larger scale 72 aquacultureedit aquaculture is the best-known byproduct because it reduces the financial and energy costs of pumping large volumes of water from the deep ocean deep ocean water contains high concentrations of essential nutrients that are depleted in surface waters due to biological consumption this artificial upwelling mimics the natural upwellings that are responsible for fertilizing and supporting the worlds largest marine ecosystems and the largest densities of life on the planet cold-water delicacies such as salmon and lobster thrive in this nutrient-rich deep seawater microalgae such as spirulina a health food supplement also can be cultivated deep-ocean water can be combined with surface water to deliver water at an optimal temperature non-native species such as salmon lobster abalone trout oysters and clams can be raised in pools supplied by otec-pumped water this extends the variety of fresh seafood products available for nearby markets such low-cost refrigeration can be used to maintain the quality of harvested fish which deteriorate quickly in warm tropical regions in kona hawaii aquaculture companies working with nelha generate about $40 million annually a significant portion of hawaiis gdp 73 the nelha plant established in 1993 produced an average of 7,000 gallons of freshwater per day koyo usa was established in 2002 to capitalize on this new economic opportunity koyo bottles the water produced by the nelha plant in hawaii with the capacity to produce one million bottles of water every day koyo is now hawaiis biggest exporter with $140 million in sales 74 hydrogen productionedit hydrogen can be produced via electrolysis using otec electricity generated steam with electrolyte compounds added to improve efficiency is a relatively pure medium for hydrogen production otec can be scaled to generate large quantities of hydrogen the main challenge is cost relative to other energy sources and fuels mineral extractionedit the ocean contains 57 trace elements in salts and other forms and dissolved in solution in the past most economic analyses concluded that mining the ocean for trace elements would be unprofitable in part because of the energy required to pump the water mining generally targets minerals that occur in high concentrations and can be extracted easily such as magnesium with otec plants supplying water the only cost is for extractioncitation needed the japanese investigated the possibility of extracting uranium and found developments in other technologies especially materials sciences were improving the prospectscitation needed political concernsedit because otec facilities are more-or-less stationary surface platforms their exact location and legal status may be affected by the united nations convention on the law of the sea treaty unclos this treaty grants coastal nations 12- and 200-nautical-mile  370km zones of varying legal authority from land creating potential conflicts and regulatory barriers otec plants and similar structures would be considered artificial islands under the treaty giving them no independent legal status otec plants could be perceived as either a threat or potential partner to fisheries or to seabed mining operations controlled by the international seabed authority cost and economicsedit for otec to be viable as a power source the technology must have tax and subsidy treatment similar to competing energy sources because otec systems have not yet been widely deployed cost estimates are uncertain one study estimates power generation costs as low as us $0.07 per kilowatt-hour compared with $0.05 - $0.07 for subsidized wind systems 75 beneficial factors that should be taken into account include otecs lack of waste products and fuel consumption the area in which it is availablecitation needed often within 20 of the equator 76 the geopolitical effects of petroleum dependence compatibility with alternate forms of ocean power such as wave energy tidal energy and methane hydrates and supplemental uses for the seawater 77 thermodynamicsedit a rigorous treatment of otec reveals that a 20c temperature difference will provide as much energy as a hydroelectric plant with 34m head for the same volume of water flow the low temperature difference means that water volumes must be very large to extract useful amounts of heat a 100mw power plant would be expected to pump on the order of 12 million gallons  44,400 metric tonnes per minute 78 for comparison pumps must move a mass of water greater than the weight of the battleship bismark which weighed 41,700 metric tons every minute this makes pumping a substantial parasitic drain on energy production in otec systems with one lockheed design consuming 19.55 mw in pumping costs for every 49.8 mw net electricity generated for otec schemes using heat exchangers to handle this volume of water the exchangers need to be enormous compared to those used in conventional thermal power generation plants 79 making them one of the most critical components due to their impact on overall efficiency a 100 mw otec power plant would require 200 exchangers each larger than a 20-foot shipping container making them the single most expensive component 80 variation of ocean temperature with depthedit the total insolation received by the oceans covering 70 of the earths surface with clearness index of 0.5 and average energy retention of 15 is 5.45×1018 mjyr  0.7  0.5  0.15  2.87×1017 mjyr we can use lamberts law to quantify the solar energy absorption by water where y is the depth of water i is intensity and μ is the absorption coefficient solving the above differential equation the absorption coefficient μ may range from 0.05 m−1 for very clear fresh water to 0.5 m−1 for very salty water since the intensity falls exponentially with depth y heat absorption is concentrated at the top layers typically in the tropics surface temperature values are in excess of 25c  77f while at 1 kilometer  0.62mi the temperature is about 5–10c  41–50f the warmer and hence lighter waters at the surface means there are no thermal convection currents due to the small temperature gradients heat transfer by conduction is too low to equalize the temperatures the ocean is thus both a practically infinite heat source and a practically infinite heat sinkclarification needed this temperature difference varies with latitude and season with the maximum in tropical subtropical and equatorial waters hence the tropics are generally the best otec locations openclaude cycleedit in this scheme warm surface water at around 27c  81f enters an evaporator at pressure slightly below the saturation pressures causing it to vaporize where hf is enthalpy of liquid water at the inlet temperature t1  this temporarily superheated water undergoes volume boiling as opposed to pool boiling in conventional boilers where the heating surface is in contact thus the water partially flashes to steam with two-phase equilibrium prevailing suppose that the pressure inside the evaporator is maintained at the saturation pressure t2 here x2 is the fraction of water by mass that vaporizes the warm water mass flow rate per unit turbine mass flow rate is 1x2 the low pressure in the evaporator is maintained by a vacuum pump that also removes the dissolved non-condensable gases from the evaporator the evaporator now contains a mixture of water and steam of very low vapor quality steam content the steam is separated from the water as saturated vapor the remaining water is saturated and is discharged to the ocean in the open cycle the steam is a low pressurehigh specific volume working fluid it expands in a special low pressure turbine here hg corresponds to t2 for an ideal isentropic reversible adiabatic turbine the above equation corresponds to the temperature at the exhaust of the turbine t5 x5s is the mass fraction of vapor at state 5 the enthalpy at t5 is this enthalpy is lower the adiabatic reversible turbine work  h3-h5s  actual turbine work wt  h3-h5s x polytropic efficiency the condenser temperature and pressure are lower since the turbine exhaust is to be discharged back into the ocean a direct contact condenser is used to mix the exhaust with cold water which results in a near-saturated water that water is now discharged back to the ocean h6hf at t5 t7 is the temperature of the exhaust mixed with cold sea water as the vapour content now is negligible the temperature differences between stages include that between warm surface water and working steam that between exhaust steam and cooling water and that between cooling water reaching the condenser and deep water these represent external irreversibilities that reduce the overall temperature

starting in the 1960s by j hilbert anderson of sea solar power inc in this cycle qh is the heat transferred in the evaporator from the warm sea water to the working fluid the working fluid exits the evaporator as a gas near its dew point the high-pressure high-temperature gas then is expanded in the turbine to yield turbine work wt the working fluid is slightly superheated at the turbine exit and the turbine typically has an efficiency of 90 based on reversible adiabatic expansion from the turbine exit the working fluid enters the condenser where it rejects heat -qc to the cold sea water the condensate is then compressed to the highest pressure in the cycle requiring condensate pump work wc thus the anderson closed cycle is a rankine-type cycle similar to the conventional power plant steam cycle except that in the anderson cycle the working fluid is never superheated more than a few degrees fahrenheit owing to viscous effects working fluid pressure drops in both the evaporator and the condenser this pressure drop which depends on the types of heat exchangers used must be considered in final design calculations but is ignored here to simplify the analysis thus the parasitic condensate pump work wc computed here will be lower than if the heat exchanger pressure drop was included the major additional parasitic energy requirements in the otec plant are the cold water pump work wct and the warm water pump work wht denoting all other parasitic energy requirements by wa the net work from the otec plant wnp is the thermodynamic cycle undergone by the working fluid can be analyzed without detailed consideration of the parasitic energy requirements from the first law of thermodynamics the energy balance for the working fluid as the system is where wn  wt  wc is the net work for the thermodynamic cycle for the idealized case in which there is no working fluid pressure drop in the heat exchangers and so that the net thermodynamic cycle work becomes subcooled liquid enters the evaporator due to the heat exchange with warm sea water evaporation takes place and usually superheated vapor leaves the evaporator this vapor drives the turbine and the 2-phase mixture enters the condenser usually the subcooled liquid leaves the condenser and finally this liquid is pumped to the evaporator completing a cycle environmental impactedit carbon dioxide dissolved in deep cold and high pressure layers is brought up to the surface and released as the water warmscitation needed mixing of deep ocean water with shallower water brings up nutrients and makes them available to shallow water life this may be an advantage for aquaculture of commercially important species but may also unbalance the ecological system around the power plantcitation needed otec plants use very large flows of warm surface seawater and cold deep seawater to generate constant renewable power the deep seawater is oxygen deficient and generally 20-40 times more nutrient rich in nitrate and nitrite than shallow seawater when these plumes are mixed they are slightly denser than the ambient seawater 81 though no large scale physical environmental testing of otec has been done computer models have been developed to simulate the effect of otec plants hydrodynamic modelingedit in 2010 a computer model was developed to simulate the physical oceanographic effects of one or several 100 megawatt otec plants the model suggests that otec plants can be configured such that the plant can conduct continuous operations with resulting temperature and nutrient variations that are within naturally occurring levels studies to date suggest that by discharging the otec flows downwards at a depth below 70 meters the dilution is adequate and nutrient enrichment is small enough so that 100 megawatt otec plants could be operated in a sustainable manner on a continuous basis  82 biological modelingedit the nutrients from an otec discharge could potentially cause increased biological activity if they accumulate in large quantities in the photic zone 82 in 2011 a biological component was added to the hydrodynamic computer model to simulate the biological response to plumes from 100 megawatt otec plants in all cases modeled discharge at 70 meters depth or more no unnatural variations occurs in the upper 40 meters of the oceans surface 81 the picoplankton response in the 110 - 70 meter depth layer is approximately a 10-25 increase which is well within naturally occurring variability the nanoplankton response is negligible the enhanced productivity of diatoms microplankton is small the subtle phytoplankton increase of the baseline otec plant suggests that higher-order biochemical effects will be very small 81 studiesedit a previous final environmental impact statement eis for the united states noaa from 1981 is available 83 but needs to be brought up to current oceanographic and engineering standards studies have been done to propose the best environmental baseline monitoring practices focusing on a set of ten chemical oceanographic parameters relevant to otec 84 most recently noaa held an otec workshop in 2010 and 2012 seeking to assess the physical chemical and biological impacts and risks and identify information gaps or needs 85  86 the tethys database provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of otec 87 technical difficultiesedit dissolved gasesedit the performance of direct contact heat exchangers operating at typical otec boundary conditions is important to the claude cycle many early claude cycle designs used a surface condenser since their performance was well understood however direct contact condensers offer significant disadvantages as cold water rises in the intake pipe the pressure decreases to the point where gas begins to evolve if a significant amount of gas comes out of solution placing a gas trap before the direct contact heat exchangers may be justified experiments simulating conditions in the warm water intake pipe indicated about 30 of the dissolved gas evolves in the top 8.5 meters  28ft of the tube the trade-off between pre-dearation 88 of the seawater and expulsion of non-condensable gases from the condenser is dependent on the gas evolution dynamics deaerator efficiency head loss vent compressor efficiency and parasitic power experimental results indicate vertical spout condensers perform some 30 better than falling jet types microbial foulingedit because raw seawater must pass through the heat exchanger care must be taken to maintain good thermal conductivity biofouling layers as thin as 25 to 50 micrometres  0.00098 to 0.00197in can degrade heat exchanger performance by as much as 50 35 a 1977 study in which mock heat exchangers were exposed to seawater for ten weeks concluded that although the level of microbial fouling was low the thermal conductivity of the system was significantly impaired 89 the apparent discrepancy between the level of fouling and the heat transfer impairment is the result of a thin layer of water trapped by the microbial growth on the surface of the heat exchanger 89 another study concluded that fouling degrades performance over time and determined that although regular brushing was able to remove most of the microbial layer over time a tougher layer formed that could not be removed through simple brushing 35 the study passed sponge rubber balls through the system it concluded that although the ball treatment decreased the fouling rate it was not enough to completely halt growth and brushing was occasionally necessary to restore capacity the microbes regrew more quickly later in the experiment ie brushing became necessary more often replicating the results of a previous study 90 the increased growth rate after subsequent cleanings appears to result from selection pressure on the microbial colony 90 continuous use of 1 hour per day and intermittent periods of free fouling and then chlorination periods again 1 hour per day were studied chlorination slowed but did not stop microbial growth however chlorination levels of .1mg per liter for 1 hour per day may prove effective for long term operation of a plant 35 the study concluded that although microbial fouling was an issue for the warm surface water heat exchanger the cold water heat exchanger suffered little or no biofouling and only minimal inorganic fouling 35 besides water temperature microbial fouling also depends on nutrient levels with growth occurring faster in nutrient rich water 91 the fouling rate also depends on the material used to construct the heat exchanger aluminium tubing slows the growth of microbial life although the oxide layer which forms on the inside of the pipes complicates cleaning and leads to larger efficiency losses 90 in contrast titanium tubing allows biofouling to occur faster but cleaning is more effective than with aluminium 90 sealingedit the evaporator turbine and condenser operate in partial vacuum ranging from 3 to 1 of atmospheric pressure the system must be carefully sealed to prevent in-leakage of atmospheric air that can degrade or shut down operation in closed-cycle otec the specific volume of low-pressure steam is very large compared to that of the pressurized working fluid components must have large flow areas to ensure steam velocities do not attain excessively high values parasitic power consumption by exhaust compressoredit an approach for reducing the exhaust compressor parasitic power loss is as follows after most of the steam has been condensed by spout condensers the non-condensible gas steam mixture is passed through a counter current region which increases the gas-steam reaction by a factor of five the result is an 80 reduction in the exhaust pumping power requirements cold airwarm water conversionedit in winter in coastal arctic locations the delta t between the seawater and ambient air can be as high as 40c  72f closed-cycle systems could exploit the air-water temperature difference eliminating seawater extraction pipes might make a system based on this concept less expensive than otec this technology is due to h barjot who suggested butane as cryogen because of its boiling point of −0.5c  31.1f and its non-solubility in water 92 assuming a level of efficiency of realistic 4 calculations show that the amount of energy generated with one cubic meter water at a temperature of 2c  36f in a place with an air temperature of −22c −8f equals the amount of energy generated by letting this cubic meter water run through a hydroelectric plant of 4000 feet  1,200 m height 93 barjot polar power plants could be located on islands in the polar region or designed as swimming barges or platforms attached to the ice cap the weather station myggbuka at greenlands east coast for example which is only 2,100km away from glasgow detects monthly mean temperatures below −15c  5f during 6 winter months in the year 94
