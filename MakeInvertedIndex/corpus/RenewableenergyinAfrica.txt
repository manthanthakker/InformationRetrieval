renewable energy in africa biofuel biomass geothermal hydropower solar energy tidal power wave power wind power topics by country 100 renewable energy marketing and policy trends v t e the developing nations of africa are popular locations for the application of renewable energy technology currently many nations already have small-scale solar wind and geothermal devices in operation providing energy to urban and rural populations these types of energy production are especially useful in remote locations because of the excessive cost of transporting electricity from large-scale power plants the applications of renewable energy technology has the potential to alleviate many of the problems that face africans every day especially if done so in a sustainable manner that prioritizes human rights access to energy is essential for the reduction of poverty and promotion of economic growth communication technologies education industrialization agricultural improvement and expansion of municipal water systems all require abundant reliable and cost-effective energy access 1  contents 1 avoiding fossil fuels 2 renewable energy resources 2.1 solar resources 2.2 wave and wind resources

nations would benefit significantly in the longer term by avoiding the pending economic problems developed countries are currently facing although in many ways fossil fuels provide a simple easy to use energy source that powered the industrialization of most modern nations the issues associated with the widespread use of fossil fuels are now numerous consisting of some of the worlds most difficult and large scale global political economic health and environmental problems the looming energy crisis results from consuming these fossil fuels at a rate which is unsustainable with the global demand for fossil fuels expected to increase every year for the next several decades compounding existing problems 2 while a great number of projects are currently underway to expand and connect the existing grid networks 3 too many problems exist to make this a realistic option for the vast majority of people in africa especially those who live in rural locations distributed generation using renewable energy systems is the only practical solution to meet rural electrification needs 4 5 renewable energy resourcesedit hydro-electric wind and solar power all derive their energy from the sun the sun emits more energy in one second  3.827  1026 j than is available in all of the fossil fuels present on earth  3.9  1022 j 6 and therefore has the potential to provide all of our current and future global energy requirements since the solar source for renewable energy is clean and free african nations can protect their people their environment and their future economic development by using renewable energy sources 7 to this end they have a number of possible options 8 solar resourcesedit africa is the sunniest continent on earth especially as there are many perpertually sunny areas like the huge sahara desert it has much greater solar resources than any other continent desert regions stand up as the most sunshiny while rainforests are considerably cloudier but still get a good global solar irradiation because of the proximity with the equator the distribution of solar resources across africa is fairly uniform with more than 85 of the continents landscape receiving at least 2,000 kwhm year a recent study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3 of the area comprising north africa could supply all of the energy required by the european union 9 this is the same land area as the state of maine wave and wind resourcesedit africa has a large coastline where wind power and wave power resources are abundant and underutilized in the north and south geothermal power has potential to provide considerable amounts of energy in many eastern african nations 10 wind is far less uniformly distributed than solar resources with optimal locations positioned near special topographical funnelling features close to coastal locations mountain ranges and other natural channels in the north and south the availability of wind on the western coast of africa is substantial exceeding 3,750kwh and will accommodate the future prospect for energy demands 11 12 central africa has lower than average wind resources to work with 13 geothermal resourcesedit geothermal power is mostly concentrated in eastern africa but there are many fragmented spots of high intensity geothermal potential spread across the continent 14 there is enormous potential for geothermal energy in the east african rift which is roughly 3,700 miles in length and spans several countries in east africa including eritrea ethiopia djibouti kenya uganda and zambia 10 biomassedit the use of biomass fuels endangers biodiversity and risks further damaged or destruction to the landscape 86 of africas biomass energy is used in the sub-saharan region excluding south africa 15 even where other forms of energy are available it is not harnessed and utilized efficiently underscoring the need to promote energy efficiency where energy access is available 16 there is however an urgent need to address the current levels of respiratory illness from burning biomass in the home taking into respect the cost differential between the biomass and fossil fuels it is far more cost-effective to improve the technology used to burn the biomass than to use fossil fuels 17 horizontal integration potentialedit solar and wind power are extremely scalable as there are systems available from less than 1 watt to several megawatts this makes it possible to initialize the electrification of a home or village with minimal initial capital it also allows for dynamic and incremental scaling as load demands increases the component configuration of a wind or solar installation also provides a level of functional redundancy improving the reliability of the system if a single panel in a multi panel solar array is damaged the rest of the system continues functioning unimpeded in a similar way the failure of a single wind tower in a multi tower configuration does not cause a system level failure because solar and wind projects produce power where it is used they provide a safe reliable and cost effective solution because transmission equipment is avoided these systems are more secure and less vulnerable to attack 18 this can be an important feature in regions prone to conflict wind and solar power systems are simple to set up easy to operate easy to repair and durable wind resources and solar resource are abundant enough to provide all of the electrical energy requirements of rural populations and this can be done in remote and otherwise fragmented low density areas that are impractical to address using conventional grid based systems 19 financeedit photo-voltaic panels wind turbines deep cycle batteries meters sockets cables and connectors are all expensive even when the relative difference in buying power materials cost opportunity cost labor cost and overhead are factored in renewable energy will remain expensive for people who are living on less than us$1 per day many rural electrification projects in the past use government subsidies to finance the implementation of rural development programs it is difficult for rural electrification projects to be accomplished by for profit companies in economically impoverished areas these programs must be run at a loss for reasons of practicality 20 there are several theorized ways in which specific african nations can rally the resources for such projects potential funding sourcesedit european countries that consume oil refined from african countries have the opportunity to subsidize the costs of individual level village level or community level alternative energy systems through emissions trading credits it has been proposed that for every unit of african origin carbon consumed by the european market a predetermined amount green credits or carbon credits would be yielded 21 the european partners could then either supply parts components or systems directly an equivalent amount of investment capital or lend credits to finance the distribution of renewable energy services knowledge or equipment 22 international relief targeted at poverty reduction could also be redirected towards subsidizing renewable energy projects because of the integral role that electrification plays in supporting economic and social development funding of rural electrification can be seen as core method for addressing poverty radios televisions telephones computer networks and computers all rely on an access to electricity because information services allow for the proliferation of education resources funding the electric backbone to such systems has derivative effect on their development in this way access to communications and education plays a major role in reducing poverty additionally international efforts that supplies equipment and services rather than money are more resistant to resource misappropriation issue that pose problems in less stable governments 23 unep has developed a loan programme to stimulate renewable energy market forces with attractive return rates buffer initial deployment costs and entice consumers to consider and purchase renewable technology after a successful solar loan program sponsored by unep that helped 100,000 people finance solar power systems in developing countries like india 24 unep started similar schemes in other parts of developing world like africa - tunisia morocco kenya projects are already functional and many projects in other african nations are in the pipeline 25 in africa unep assistance to ghana kenya and namibia has resulted in the adoption of draft national climate awareness plans publications in local languages radio programmes and seminars 26 the rural energy enterprise development reed initiative is another flagship unep effort focused on enterprise development and seed financing for clean energy entrepreneurs in developing countries of west and southern africa 27 the government of south africa has set up the south african renewables initiative sari 28 to develop a financing arrangement that would enable a critical mass of renewables to be developed in south africa through a combination of international loans and grants as well as domestic funding this has been a highly successful programme now known as the reippp renewable energy independent power producer programme with four rounds of allocations already completed in round 1 19 projects were allocated in round 2 28 projects were allocated in round 3 17 projects were allocated and in round 4 26 projects were allocated over 6100mw has been allocated with a total of r194 billion us$16 billion being invested in this programme it is important to note that this investment figure represents full funding from private entities and banks - there are no government subsidies for this programme energy sector regulators as facilitatorsedit the funding of renewable energy re projects is dependent on the credibility of the institutions developing and implementing re policy this places a particular burden on the energy regulators in africawhose professional staff may be few in number and who have track records of only a decade or so rules micro policies made by regulators are subsidiary to overall government re policy and depend on some delegation of authority from the state nevertheless there are instances when the sector regulator can pro-active on behalf of customer and utility concernsproviding facts reports and public statements that build a case for care in the design of public policy towards re clean and renewable energy is likely to be of concern to a number of organizations interaction between multiple authorities requires coordination to align policies incentives and administrative processes including licensing and permitting of course the making of policy by regulators is incidental to and inherent in their duty to decide specific cases or disputes this micro policy making role is derived from the fact that macro re policy cannot reasonably be expected to anticipate all aspects of policy that will have to evolve for the regulatory process to be fully functional this point is particularly important in the area of renewable energy with its rapidly changing technologies and ever-changing public and political attitudes gaps will have to be filled and it is the regulators with their functional responsibilities technical expertise and hands-on experience that are best positioned to accomplish that task in developing countries thus for designing auctions for purchased power for establishing feed-in tariffs or other instruments promoting re the energy sector regulator has a significant impact on the penetration of re in africa and other regions 29 renewable energy useedit solar poweredit several large-scale solar power facilities are under development in africa including projects in south africa and algeria 30 although solar power technology has the potential to supply energy to large numbers of people and has been used to generate power on a large scale in developed nations its greatest potential in africa may be to provide power on a smaller scale and to use this energy to help with day-to-day needs such as small-scale electrification desalination water pumping and water purification the first utility-scale solar farm in sub-saharan africa is the 8.5mw plant at agahozo-shalom youth village in the rwamagana district eastern province of rwanda it leased 20 hectares  49 acres of land from the village which is a charity to house and educate rwandan genocide victims the plant uses 28,360 photovoltaic panels and produces 6 of total electrical supply of the country the project was built with us israeli dutch norwegian finnish and uk funding and expertise 31 there are several examples of small grid-linked solar power stations in africa including the photovoltaic 250kw kigali solaire station in rwanda 32 under the south africa renewable energy independent power producer procurement program 33 several projects have been developed including the 96mwdc jasper solar energy project 34 the 75mwdc lesedi pv project 35 and the 75mwdc letsatsi pv project 36 all developed by the american company solarreserve and completed in 2014 power up gambia a non-profit operating in the gambia uses solar power technology to provide power to gambian health care facilities providing a reliable source of electricity for lighting diagnostic testing treatments and water pumping 37 38 energy for opportunity efo a non-profit working in west africa uses solar power for schools health clinics and community charging stations as well as teaches photovoltaic installation classes at local technical institutes so far its work has been mainly in sierra leone 39 in particular its solar powered community charging stations have been recognized as an innovative model to provide electricity to rural communities in the region 40 41 some plans exist to build solar farms in the deserts of north africa to supply power for europe the desertec project backed by several european energy companies and banks planned to generate renewable electricity in the sahara desert and distribute it through a high-voltage grid for export to europe and local consumption in north-africa ambitions seek to provide continental europe with up to 15 of its electricity the tunur project would supply 2gw of solar generated electricity from tunisia to the uk solar water pumpingedit one of the most immediate and lethal problems facing many third world countries is the availability of clean drinking water solar powered technologies can help alleviate this problem with minimal cost using a combination of solar powered well pumping a water tower or other holding tank and a solar powered water purifier these technologies require minimal maintenance have low operational costs and once set up will help provide clean water for drinking and agriculture with large enough reservoirs for the water that has been pumped and purified with solar powered technology a community will be better able to withstand drought or famine this reservoir water could be consumed by humans livestock or used to irrigate community gardens and fields thus improving crop yields and community health a solar powered water purification system can be used to clean many pathogens and germs from groundwater and runoff a group of these devices filtering the water from wells or runoff could help with poor sanitation and controlling the spread of waterborne illnesses kenya may be a good candidate for testing out these systems because of its progressive and relatively well-funded department of agriculture including the kenya agricultural research center  5 which provides funding and oversight to many projects investigating experimental methods and technologies even though this solar technology may have a higher starting cost than that of conventional fossil fuel the low maintenance and operation cost and the ability to operate without fuel makes the solar powered systems cheaper to keep running a small rural community could use a system like this indefinitely and it would provide clean drinking water at a negligible cost after the initial equipment purchase and setup in a larger community it could at least contribute to the water supply and reduce pressures of daily survival this technology is capable of pumping hundreds of gallons of water per day and is limited only by the amount of water available in the water table with a minimum of training in operation and maintenance solar powered water pumping and purification systems have the potential to help rural africans fulfill one of their most basic needs for survival further field test are in progress by organizations like kari and the many corporations that manufacture the products needed and these small-scale applications of solar technology are promising combined with sustainable agricultural practices and conservation of natural resources solar power is a prime candidate to bring the benefits of technology to the parched lands of africa supplementing the well water would be collection of runoff rainwater during the rainy season for later use in drought southern africa has its own network of information sharing called searnet  6 which informs farmers of techniques to catch and store rainwater with some seeing increased yields and additional harvests 42 this new network of farmers sharing their ideas with each other has led to a spread of both new and old ideas and this has led to greater sustainability of water resources in the countries of botswana ethiopia kenya malawi rwanda tanzania uganda zambia and zimbabwe this water could be used for agriculture or livestock or could be fed through a purifier to yield water suitable for human consumption examplesedit a solar powered water pump and holding system was installed in kayrati chad in 2004 as compensation for land lost to oil development 43 this system utilizes a standard well pump powered by a photovoltaic panel array the pumped water is stored in a water tower providing the pressure needed to deliver water to homes in the area this use of oil revenue to build infrastructure is an example of using profits to advance the standard of living in rural areas hundreds of solar water pumping stations in sudan fulfil a similar role involving various applications of different systems for pumping and storage over the past 10 years approximately 250 photovoltaic water pumps have been installed in sudan considerable progress has been made and the present generation of systems appear to be reliable and costeffective under certain conditions a photovoltaic pumping system to pump 25 cubic metres per day requires a solar array of approx 800 wp such a pump would cost us$6000 since the total system comprises the cost of modules pump motor pipework wiring control system and array support structure pv water pumping has been promoted successfully in kordofan state in sudan it shows favorable economics as compared to diesel pumps and is free from the need to maintain a regular supply of fuel the only maintenance problems with pv pumping are due to the breakdown of pumps and not the failure of the pv devices 44 the solar water purifier developed and manufactured by an australian company is a low-maintenance low operational cost solution that is able to purify large amounts of water even seawater to levels better than human consumption standards set by the world health organization 45 this device works through the processes of evaporation and uv radiation light passes through the top layer of glass to the black plastic layer underneath heat from the solar radiation is trapped by the water and by the black plastic this plastic layer is a series of connected troughs that separate the water as it evaporates and trickles down through the levels the water is also subjected to uv radiation for an extended period of time as it moves through the device which kills many bacteria viruses and other pathogens in a sunny equatorial area like much of africa this device is capable of purifying up to 45 litres per day from a single array additional arrays may be chained together for more capacity the water school uses sodis solar disinfection currently in target areas of kenya and uganda to help people drink water free of pathogens and disease causing bacteria sodis is a uv process that kills microorganisms in the water to prevent water borne disease the science of the sodis system is proven with over 20 years of research wind poweredit the koudia al baida farm in morocco is the largest wind farm in the continent currently two others big wind farms are under construction in tangier and tarfaya kenya plans on building a wind farm the lake turkana wind power ltwp in marsabit countythe first 50 - 90 mw from ltwp are scheduled for 2015 ltwp is planned to produce 300 mw of wind power at full capacity 46 in january 2009 the first wind turbine in west africa was erected in batokunku a village in the gambia the 150 kilowatt turbine provides electrical power for the 2,000-person village 47 the south african reippp has resulted in several wind farms already in commercial operation in the country these wind farms are currently in operation in the provinces of the eastern northern and western cape it is estimated that 10 farms are already under construction or in operation with 12 more being approved with the 4th round of the reippp geothermal poweredit so far only kenya has exploited the geothermal potential of the great rift valley 10 kenya has been estimated to contain 10,000 mwe of potential geothermal energy 48 and has twenty potential drilling sites marked for survey in addition to three operational geothermal plants 49 kenya was the first country in africa to adopt geothermal energy in 1956 and houses the largest geothermal power plant on the continent olkaria ii operated by kengen who also operate olkaria i a further plant olkaria iii is privately owned and operated 49 50 ethiopia is home to a single binary-cycle plant but does not utilize its full potential energy output for lack of experience in its operation 10 zambia has several sites planned for construction but their projects have stalled due to lack of funds 10 eritrea djibouti and uganda have undertaken preliminary exploration for potential geothermal sources but have not constructed any type of power plant 10 geothermal power has been used in agricultural projects in africa the oserian flower farm in kenya utilizes several steam wells abandoned by kengen to power its greenhouse in addition the heat involved in the geothermal process is used to maintain stable greenhouse temperatures the heat can also be utilized in cooking which would help eliminate the dependence on wood burning 51 financeedit exploration and construction of future geothermal plants present a high cost for poor countries 52 drilling potential sites alone costs millions of dollars and can result in zero energy return if the consistency of the heat and steam is unreliable 53 return on investments into geothermal power are not as quick as those into fossil fuels and may take years to pay off however low maintenance cost and the renewable nature of geothermal energy means more benefits in the long term 52 as an early and successful adopter of geothermal power kenya now has significant financial backing from the world bank 50 the
