carnot method the carnot method is an allocation procedure for dividing up fuel input primary energy end energy in joint production processes that generate two or more energy products in one process eg cogeneration or trigeneration it is also suited to allocate other streams such as co2-emissions or variable costs the potential to generate mechanical or electrical work exergy is used as the distribution key for heat this potential can be assessed the carnot efficiency thus the carnot method is a form of an exergetic allocation method it uses mean heat grid temperatures at the output of the process as a calculation basis the main application area of this method is cogeneration but it can also be applied to other processes generating a joint products such as a chiller generating cold and producing waste heat which could be used for low temperature heat demand the carnot methods advantage is that no external reference values are required to allocate the input to the different output streams only endogenous process parameters are needed thus the allocation results remain unbiased of assumptions or external reference values that are open for discussion  contents 1 fuel

performance factor of energy transformationedit next to the efficiency factor which describes the quantity of usable end energies the quality of energy transformation according to the entropy law is also important with rising entropy exergy declines exergy does not only consider energy but also energy quality it can be considered a product of both therefore any energy transformation should also be assessed according to its exergetic efficiciency or loss ratios the quality of the product thermal energy is fundamentally determined by the mean temperature level at which this heat is delivered hence the exergetic efficiency ηx describes how much of the fuels potential to generate physical work remains in the joint energy products with cogeneration the result is the following relation

the input fi and the quantities of i o1 and o2 are known an equation with two unknowns f1 and f2 has to be solved which is possible with a lot of adequate tuples as second equation the physical transformation of product o1 in o2 and vice versa is used o1  η21  o2 η21 is the transformation factor from o2 into o1 the inverse 1η21η12 describes the backward transformation a reversible transformation is assumed in order not to favour any of the two directions because of the exhangeability of o1 and o2 the assessment of the two sides of the equation above with the two factors f1 and f2 should therefore result in an equivalent outcome output o2 evaluated with f2 shall be the same as the amount of o1 generated from o2 and evaluated with f1 f1  η21  o2  f2  o2 if we put this into
