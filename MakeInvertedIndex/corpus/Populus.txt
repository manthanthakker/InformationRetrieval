populus see text populus is a genus of 25–35 species of deciduous flowering plants in the family salicaceae native to most of the northern hemisphere english names variously applied to different species include poplar ˈpɒplər aspen and cottonwood in the september 2006 issue of science magazine the joint genome institute announced that the western balsam poplar p trichocarpa was the first tree whose full dna code had been determined by dna sequencing 2  contents 1 description 2 ecology 3 classification 3.1 selected species 4 cultivation 4.1 india 5 uses 5.1 manufacturing 5.2 energy 5.3 art

diameter the bark on young trees is smooth white to greenish or dark grey and often has conspicuous lenticels on old trees it remains smooth in some species but becomes rough and deeply fissured in others the shoots are stout with unlike in the related willows the terminal bud present the leaves are spirally arranged and vary in shape from triangular to circular or rarely lobed and with a long petiole in species in the sections populus and aigeiros the petioles are laterally flattened so that breezes easily cause the leaves to wobble back and forth giving the whole tree a twinkling appearance in a breeze leaf size is very variable even on a single tree typically with small leaves on side shoots and very large leaves on strong-growing lead shoots the leaves often turn bright gold to yellow before they fall during autumn 3 4 the flowers are mostly dioecious rarely monoecious and appear in early spring before the leaves they are borne in long drooping sessile or pedunculate catkins produced from buds formed in the axils of the leaves of the previous year the flowers are each seated in a cup-shaped disk which is borne on the base of a scale which is itself attached to the rachis of the catkin the scales are obovate lobed and fringed membranous hairy or smooth and usually caducous the male flowers are without calyx or corolla and comprise a group of four to 60 stamens inserted on a disk filaments are short and pale yellow anthers are oblong purple or red introrse and two-celled the cells open longitudinally the female flower also has no calyx or corolla and comprises a single-celled ovary seated in a cup-shaped disk the style is short with two to four stigmata variously lobed and numerous ovules pollination is by wind with the female catkins lengthening considerably between pollination and maturity the fruit is a two- to four-valved dehiscent capsule green to reddish-brown mature in midsummer containing numerous minute light brown seeds surrounded by tufts of long soft white hairs which aid wind dispersal 3 5 ecologyedit poplars of the cottonwood section are often wetlands or riparian trees the aspens are among the most important boreal broadleaf trees 3 poplars and aspens are important food plants for the larvae of a large number of lepidoptera species pleurotus populinus the aspen oyster mushroom is found exclusively on dead wood of populus trees in north america classificationedit the genus populus has traditionally been divided into six sections on the basis of leaf and flower characters 4 6 this classification is followed below recent genetic studies have largely supported this confirming some previously suspected reticulate evolution due to past hybridisation and introgression events between the groups some species noted below had differing relationships indicated by their nuclear dna paternally inherited and chloroplast dna sequences maternally inherited a clear indication of likely hybrid origin 7 hybridisation continues to be common in the genus with several hybrids between species in different sections known 3 8 selected speciesedit populus section populus  aspens and white poplar circumpolar subarctic and cool

they have the advantage of growing to a very large size at a rapid pace almost all poplars take root readily from cuttings or where broken branches lie on the ground they also often have remarkable suckering abilities and can form huge colonies from a single original tree such as the famous pando forest made of thousands of populus tremuloides clones trees with fastigiate erect columnar branching are particularly popular and are widely grown across europe and southwest asia however like willows poplars have very vigorous and invasive root systems stretching up to 40m from the trees planting close to houses or ceramic water pipes may result in damaged foundations and cracked walls and pipes due to their search for moisture a simple reproducible high-frequency micropropagation protocol in eastern cottonwood populus deltoides has been reported by yadav et al 2009 9 indiaedit in india the poplar is grown commercially by farmers mainly in the punjab region common poplar varieties are g48 grown in the plains of punjab haryana up w22 grown in mountainous regions eg himachal pradesh pathankot jammu the trees are grown from kalam or cuttings harvested annually in january and february and commercially available up to 15november most commonly used to make plywood yamuna nagar in haryana state has a large plywood industry reliant upon poplar it is graded according to sizes known as over over 24 inches  610mm under  18–24 inches  460–610mm and sokta less than 18 inches  460mm usesedit although the wood from populus is known as poplar wood a common high-quality hardwood poplar with a greenish colour is actually from an unrelated genus liriodendron populus wood is a lighter more porous material its flexibility and close grain make it suitable for a number of applications similar to those for willow the greeks and etruscans made shields of poplar and pliny also recommended poplar for this purpose 10 poplar continued to be used for shield construction through the middle ages and was renowned for a durability similar to that of oak but at a substantial reduction in weight manufacturingedit in many areas fast-growing hybrid poplars are grown on plantations for pulpwood poplar is widely used for the manufacture of paper 11 it is also sold as inexpensive hardwood timber used for pallets and cheap plywood more specialised uses include matches and the boxes in which camembert cheese is sold poplar wood is also widely used in the snowboard industry for the snowboard core because it has exceptional flexibility and is sometimes used in the bodies of electric guitars and drums poplar wood particularly when seasoned makes a good hearth for a bow drill due to its high tannic acid content the bark has been used in europe for tanning leather 5 poplar wood can be used to produce chopsticks or wooden shoes baking moulds from peeled poplar may be used in the freezer oven or microwave oven 12 energyedit interest exists in using poplar as an energy crop for biomass or biofuel in energy forestry systems particularly in light of its high energy-in to energy-out ratio large carbon mitigation potential and fast growth in the united kingdom poplar as with fellow energy crop willow is typically grown in a short rotation coppice system for two to five years with single or multiple stems then harvested and burned - the yield of some varieties can be as high as 12 oven-dry tonnes per hectare every year 13 art and literatureedit poplar was the most common wood used in italy for panel paintings the mona lisa and most famous early renaissance italian paintings are on poplar the wood is generally white often with a slightly yellowish colour some stringed instruments are made with one-piece poplar backs violas made in this fashion are saidcitation needed to have a particularly resonant tone similarly though typically it is considered to have a less attractive grain than the traditional sitka spruce poplar is beginning to be targeted by some harp luthiers as a sustainable and even superior alternative for their sound boards 14 in these cases another hardwood veneer is sometimes applied to the resonant poplar base both for cosmetic reasons and supposedly to fine-tune the acoustic properties two notable poems in english lament the cutting down of poplars william cowpers the poplar field and gerard manley hopkins binsey poplars felled 1879 abel meeropols poem strange fruit mentions poplar trees in the context of lynching the odd poplers alley in iași romania is one of the spots where mihai eminescu sought inspiration in his works the poem down where the lonely poplars grow in 1973 the 15 white poplars still left with age ranges between 233 and 371 years were declared natural monuments 15 resistance against termitesedit in pakistan poplar is grown on commercial level by farmers in punjab sindh and khyber pakhtunkhwa provinces however all varieties are seriously susceptible to termite attack causing significant losses to poplar every year logs of poplar are therefore also used in termite traps termaps for biocontrol of termites in crops land managementedit lombardy poplars are frequently used as a windbreak around agricultural fields to protect against wind erosion agricultureedit logs from the poplar provide a growing medium for shiitake mushrooms 16 see alsoedit poplar walk christ
