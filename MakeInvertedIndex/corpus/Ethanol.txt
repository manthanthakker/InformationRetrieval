acid-base chemistry 10.5 halogenation 10.6 oxidation etymologyedit ethanol is the systematic name defined by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac for a molecule with two carbon atoms prefix eth- having a single bond between them suffix -ane and an attached functional group-oh group suffix -ol 1 the prefix ethyl was coined in 1834 by the german chemist justus liebig 17 ethyl is a contraction of the ancient greek αἰθήρ aithḗr upper air and the greek word ύλη hyle substance 18 the name ethanol was coined as a result of a resolution that was adopted at the international conference on chemical nomenclature that was held in april 1892 in geneva switzerland 19 the term alcohol now refers to a wider class of substances in chemistry nomenclature but in common parlance it remains the name of ethanol ultimately a medieval loan from arabic al-kuḥl 20 use of alcohol in this sense is modern introduced in the mid 18th century before that time middle latin alcohol referred to powdered ore of antimony powdered cosmetic by the later 17th century any sublimated substance distilled spirit use for the spirit of wine shortened from a full expression alcohol of wine recorded 1753 the systematic use in chemistry dates to 1850 usesedit medicaledit antisepticedit ethanol is used in medical wipes and most common antibacterial hand sanitizer gels as an antiseptic ethanol kills organisms by denaturing their proteins and dissolving their lipids and is effective against most bacteria and fungi and many viruses however ethanol is ineffective against bacterial spores 21 antitussiveedit ethanol is widely used clinically and over the counter as an antitussive agent 22 antidoteedit ethanol may be administered as an antidote to methanol 23 and ethylene glycol poisoning medicinal solventedit ethanol often in high concentrations is used to dissolve many water-insoluble medications and related compounds proprietary liquid preparations of cough and cold remedies analgesics and mouth washes may be dissolved in 1 to 25 concentrations of ethanol and may need to be avoided in individuals with adverse reactions to ethanol such as alcohol-induced respiratory reactions 24 recreationaledit ethanol is a central nervous system depressant and has significant psychoactive effects in sublethal doses based on its abilities to alter human consciousness ethanol is considered a psychoactive drug 25 the amount of ethanol in the body is typically quantified by blood alcohol content bac which is here taken as weight of ethanol per unit volume of blood small doses of ethanol in general produce euphoria and relaxation people experiencing these symptoms tend to become talkative and less inhibited and may exhibit poor judgment at higher dosages bac  1gl ethanol acts as a central nervous system depressant producing at progressively higher dosages impaired sensory and motor function slowed cognition stupefaction unconsciousness and possible death ethanol is commonly consumed as a recreational drug especially while socializing due to its psychoactive effects fueledit engine fueledit the largest single use of ethanol is as an engine fuel and fuel additive brazil in particular relies heavily upon the use of ethanol as an engine fuel due in part to its role as the globes leading producer of ethanol 30 gasoline sold in brazil contains at least 25 anhydrous ethanol hydrous ethanol about 95 ethanol and 5 water can be used as fuel in more than 90 of new gasoline fueled cars sold in the country brazilian ethanol is produced from sugar cane and noted for high carbon sequestration 31 the us and many other countries primarily use e10  10 ethanol sometimes known as gasohol and e85  85 ethanol ethanolgasoline mixtures ethanol has been used as rocket fuel and is currently in lightweight rocket-powered racing aircraft 32 australian law limits the use of pure ethanol from sugarcane waste to 10 in automobiles older cars and vintage cars designed to use a slower burning fuel should have the engine valves upgraded or replaced 33 according to an industry advocacy group ethanol as a fuel reduces harmful tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide particulate matter oxides of nitrogen and other ozone-forming pollutants 34 argonne national laboratory analyzed greenhouse gas emissions of many different engine and fuel combinations and found that biodieselpetrodiesel blend b20 showed a reduction of 8 conventional e85 ethanol blend a reduction of 17 and cellulosic ethanol 64 compared with pure gasoline 35 ethanol combustion in an internal combustion engine yields many of the products of incomplete combustion produced by gasoline and significantly larger amounts of formaldehyde and related species such as acetaldehyde 36 this leads to a significantly larger photochemical reactivity and more ground level ozone 37 these data have been assembled into the clean fuels report comparison of fuel emissions 38 and show that ethanol exhaust generates 2.14times as much ozone as gasoline exhaustcitation needed when this is added into the custom localised pollution index lpi of the clean fuels report the local pollution of ethanol pollution that contributes to smog is rated 1.7 where gasoline is 1.0 and higher numbers signify greater pollutioncitation needed the california air resources board formalized this issue in 2008 by recognizing control standards for formaldehydes as an emissions control group much like the conventional nox and reactive organic gases rogs 39 world production of ethanol in 2006 was 51 gigalitres  1.3×1010usgal with 69 of the world supply coming from brazil and the united states 40 more than 20 of brazilian cars are able to use 100 ethanol as fuel which includes ethanol-only engines and flex-fuel engines 41 flex-fuel engines in brazil are able to work with all ethanol all gasoline or any mixture of both in the us flex-fuel vehicles can run on 0 to 85 ethanol  15 gasoline since higher ethanol blends are not yet allowed or efficient brazil supports this population of ethanol-burning automobiles with large national infrastructure that produces ethanol from domestically grown sugar cane sugar cane not only has a greater concentration of sucrose than corn by about 30 but is also much easier to extract the bagasse generated by the process is not wasted but is used in power plants to produce electricitycitation needed in the united states the ethanol fuel industry is based largely on corn according to the renewable fuels association as of 30 october 2007 131 grain ethanol bio-refineries in the united states have the capacity to produce 7.0billion us gallons  26,000,000m3 of ethanol per year an additional 72 construction projects underway in the us can add 6.4billion us gallons  24,000,000m3 of new capacity in the next 18 months over time it is believed that a material portion of the ≈150-billion-us-gallon  570,000,000m3 per year market for gasoline will begin to be replaced with fuel ethanol 42 sweet sorghum is another potential source of ethanol and is suitable for growing in dryland conditions the international crops research institute for the semi-arid tropics icrisat is investigating the possibility of growing sorgham as a source of fuel food and animal feed in arid parts of asia and africa 43 sweet sorghum has one-third the water requirement of sugarcane over the same time period it also requires about 22 less water than corn also known as maize the worlds first sweet sorghum ethanol distillery began commercial production in 2007 in andhra pradesh india 44 ethanols high miscibility with water makes it unsuitable for shipping through modern pipelines like liquid hydrocarbons 45 mechanics have seen increased cases of damage to small engines in particular the carburetor and attribute the damage to the increased water retention by ethanol in fuel 46 rocket fueledit ethanol was commonly used as fuel in early bipropellant rocket liquid propelled vehicles in conjunction with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen the german v-2 rocket of world war ii credited with beginning the space age used ethanol mixed with 25 of water to reduce the combustion chamber temperature 47 48 the v-2s design team helped develop us rockets following world war ii including the ethanol-fueled redstone rocket which launched the first us satellite 49 alcohols fell into general disuse as more efficient rocket fuels were developed 48 fuel cellsedit commercial fuel cells operate on reformed natural gas hydrogen or methanol ethanol is an attractive alternative due to its wide availability low cost high purity and low toxicity there are a wide range of fuel cell concepts that have been trialled including direct-ethanol fuel cells auto-thermal reforming systems and thermally integrated systems the majority of work is being conducted at a research level although there are a number of organizations at the beginning of commercialization of ethanol fuel cells 50 household heatingedit ethanol fireplaces can be used for home heating or for decoration 51 feedstockedit ethanol is an important industrial ingredient it has widespread use as a precursor for other organic compounds such as ethyl halides ethyl esters diethyl ether acetic acid and ethyl amines solventedit ethanol is miscible with water and is a good general purpose solvent it is found in paints tinctures markers and personal care products such as mouthwashes perfumes and deodorants however polysaccharides precipitate from aqueous solution in the presence of alcohol and ethanol precipitation is used for this reason in the purification of dna and rna adverse effectsedit loss of balanceedit when alcohol reaches the brain it has the ability to delay signals that are sent between nerve cells that control balance thinking and movement 53 gastrointestinal diseasesedit alcohol stimulates gastric juice production even when food is not present and as a result its consumption will stimulate acidic secretions normally intended to digest protein molecules consequently the excess acidity may harm the inner lining of the stomach the stomach lining is normally protected by a mucosal layer which prevents the stomach from essentially digesting itself however in patients who have a peptic ulcer disease pud this mucosal layer is broken down pud is commonly associated with the bacteria h pylori h pylori secrete a toxin that weakens the mucosal wall which as a result lead to acid and protein enzymes penetrating the weakened barrier because alcohol stimulates a persons stomach to secrete acid a person with pud should avoid drinking alcohol on an empty stomach drinking alcohol would cause more acid release which would further damage the already-weakened stomach wall 54 complications of this disease could include a burning pain in the abdomen bloating and in severe cases the presence of dark black stools indicate internal bleeding 55 a person who drinks alcohol regularly is strongly advised to reduce their intake to prevent pud aggravation 55 ingestion of alcohol can initiate systemic pro-inflammatory changes through two intestinal routes  1 altering intestinal microbiota composition dysbiosis which increases lipopolysaccharide lps release and  2 degrading intestinal barrier integrity - thus allowing this lps to enter the circulatory system the major portion of the blood supply to the liver is provided the portal vein therefore while the liver is continuously fed nutrients from the intestine it is also exposed to any bacteria andor bacterial derivatives that breach the intestinal mucosal barrier consequently lps levels increase in the portal vein liver and systemic circulation after alcohol intake immune cells in the liver respond to lps with the production of reactive oxygen species ros leukotrienes chemokines and cytokines these factors promote tissue inflammation and contribute to organ pathology 56 short-term toxic allergy-like responsesedit ethanol-containing beverages can cause urticarial skin eruptions systemic dermatitis alcohol flush reactions exacerbations of rhinitis and more seriously and commonly bronchoconstriction in patients with a history of asthma these reactions occur within 1–60 minutes of ethanol ingestion and are due to 1 genetic abnormalities in the metabolism of ethanol which cause the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde to accumulate in tissues and trigger the release of histamine the evoker of these symptoms 2 true allergy reactions to allergens occurring naturally in or contaminating alcoholic beverages particularly wines and beers and 3 unknown causes 24 long-termedit birth defectsedit ethanol is classified as a teratogenmedical citation needed according to the cdc alcohol consumption by women of child-bearing age who are not using birth control increases the risk of fetal alcohol syndrome the cdc currently recommends complete abstinence from alcoholic beverages 57 canceredit iarc list ethanol in alcoholic beverages as group 1 carcinogens and arguments there is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of acetaldehyde the major metabolite of ethanol in experimental animals 58 other effectsedit frequent drinking of alcoholic beverages has been shown to be a major contributing factor in cases of elevated blood levels of triglycerides 59 reinforcement disordersedit addictionedit the reinforcing effects of alcohol consumption are mediated by acetaldehyde generated by catalase and other oxidizing enzymes such as cytochrome p-4502e1 in the brain 60 although acetaldehyde has been associated with some of the adverse and toxic effects of ethanol it appears to play a central role in the activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system 61 ethanols rewarding and reinforcing ie addictive properties are mediated through its effects on dopamine neurons in the mesolimbic reward pathway which connects the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens nacc 62 63 one of ethanols primary effects is the allosteric inhibition of nmda receptors and facilitation of gabaa receptors eg enhanced gabaa receptor-mediated chloride flux through allosteric regulation of the receptor 64 at high doses ethanol inhibits most ligand gated ion channels and voltage gated ion channels in neurons as well 64 with acute alcohol consumption dopamine is released in the synapses of the mesolimbic pathway in turn heightening activation of postsynaptic d1 receptors 62 63 the activation of these receptors triggers postsynaptic internal signaling events through protein kinase a which ultimately phosphorylate camp response element binding protein creb inducing creb-mediated changes in gene expression 62 63 with chronic alcohol intake consumption of ethanol similarly induces creb phosphorylation through the d1 receptor pathway but it also alters nmda receptor function through phosphorylation mechanisms 62 63 an adaptive downregulation of the d1 receptor pathway and creb function occurs as well 62 63 chronic consumption is also associated with an effect on creb phosphorylation and function via postsynaptic nmda receptor signaling cascades through a mapkerk pathway and camk-mediated pathway 63 these modifications to creb function in the mesolimbic pathway induce expression ie increase gene expression of δfosb in the nacc 63 where δfosb is the master control protein that when overexpressed in the nacc is necessary and sufficient for the development and maintenance of an addictive state ie its overexpression in the nucleus accumbens produces and then directly modulates compulsive alcohol consumption 63 65 66 67 dependence and withdrawaledit discontinuing consumption of alcohol after several years of heavy drinking can also be fatal alcohol withdrawal can cause anxiety autonomic dysfunction seizures and hallucinations delirium tremens is a condition that requires people with a long history of heavy drinking to undertake an alcohol detoxification regimen overdoseedit death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol levels reach 0.4 a blood level of 0.5 or more is commonly fatal levels of even less than 0.1 can cause intoxication with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3–0.4 69 prolonged heavy consumption of alcohol can cause significant permanent damage to the brain and other organs interactionsedit ethanol can intensify the sedation caused by other central nervous system depressant drugs such as barbiturates benzodiazepines opioids non-benzodiazepines such as zolpidem and zopiclone antipsychotics sedative antihistamines and antidepressants 69 it interacts with cocaine in vivo to produce cocaethylene another psychoactive substance 70 ethanol enhances the bioavailability of methylphenidate elevated plasma d-mph 71 in combination with cannabis ethanol increases plasma thc levels which suggests that ethanol may increase the absorption of thc 72 alcohol and metronidazoleedit one of the most important drugfood interactions that should be noted is between alcohol and metronidazole metronidazole is an antibacterial agent that kills bacteria by damaging cellular dna and hence cellular function 73 metronidazole is usually given to people who have diarrhea caused by clostridium difficile bacteria c difficile is one of the most common microorganisms that cause diarrhea and can lead to complications such as colon inflammation and even more severely death patients who are taking metronidazole are strongly advised to avoid alcohol even after 1hour after the last dose the reason is that alcohol and metronidazole can lead to side effects such as flushing headache nausea vomiting abdominal cramps and sweating 74 75 75 these symptoms are often called the disulfiram-like reaction the proposed mechanism of action for this interaction is that metronidazole can bind to an enzyme that normally metabolizes alcohol binding to this enzyme may impair the livers ability to process alcohol for proper excretion 76 pharmacologyedit pharmacodynamicsedit ethanol acts in the central nervous system primarily by binding to the gabaa receptor increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gaba ie it is a positive allosteric modulator 77 ethanol is known to possess the following direct pharmacodynamic actions most important actions are bolded 78 gabaa receptor positive allosteric modulator 64 primarily of δ subunit-containing receptors nmda receptor negative allosteric modulator 64 79 mesolimbic dopamine release secondary to gabaanmda receptor modulation 64 61 endogenous opioid release in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway secondary to an unidentified mechanism in the nacc or vta 64 ampa receptor negative allosteric modulator 79 kainate receptor negative allosteric modulator 79 nach receptor agonist 5-ht3 receptor agonist glycine reuptake inhibitor 80 adenosine reuptake inhibitor 81 l-type calcium channel blocker girk channel opener mesolimbic dopamine release secondary to gabaanmda receptor modulation 64 61 endogenous opioid release in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway secondary to an unidentified mechanism in the nacc or vta 64 some of its actions on ligand-gated ion channels specifically the nach receptors and the glycine receptor are dose-dependent with potentiation or inhibition occurring dependent on ethanol concentration this is because ethanols effects on these channels are a summation of positive and negative allosteric modulatory actions 78 pharmacokineticsedit the removal of ethanol from the human body through oxidation by alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver is limited hence the removal of a large concentration of alcohol from blood may follow zero-order kinetics this means that alcohol leaves the body at a constant rate rather than having an elimination half-life 9 the rate-limiting steps for one substance may be in common with other substances as a result the blood alcohol concentration can be used to modify the rate of metabolism of methanol and ethylene glycol methanol itself is not highly toxic but its metabolites formaldehyde and formic acid are therefore to reduce the rate of production and concentration of these harmful metabolites ethanol can be ingested 82 ethylene glycol poisoning can be treated in the same way pure ethanol will irritate the skin and eyes 83 nausea vomiting and intoxication are symptoms of ingestion long-term use by ingestion can result in serious liver damage 84 atmospheric concentrations above one in a thousand are above the european union occupational exposure limits 84 metabolismedit ethanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then into the acetyl in acetyl coa by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase acetyl coa is the final product of both carbohydrate and fat metabolism where the acetyl can be further used to produce energy or for biosynthesis as such ethanol can be compared to an energy-bearing macronutrient yielding approximately 7 kcal per gram consumed 85 however the product of the first step of this breakdown acetaldehyde 86 is more toxic than ethanol acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol it has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver 87 and multiple forms of cancer during the metabolism of alcohol via the respective dehydrogenases nad nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is converted into reduced nad normally nad is used to metabolise fats in the liver and as such alcohol competes with these fats for the use of nad prolonged exposure to alcohol means that fats accumulate in the liver leading to the term fatty liver continued consumption such as in alcoholism then leads to cell death in the hepatocytes as the fat stores reduce the function of the cell to the point of death these cells are then replaced with scar tissue leading to the condition called cirrhosis alcohol and digestionedit a part of ethyl alcohol is hydrophobic this hydrophobic or lipophilic end can diffuse across cells that line the stomach wall in fact alcohol is one of the rare substances that can be absorbed in the stomach most food substances are absorbed in the small intestine however even though alcohol can be absorbed in the stomach it is mostly absorbed in the small intestine because the small intestine has a large surface area that promotes absorption once alcohol is absorbed in the small intestine it delays the release of stomach contents from emptying into the small intestine thus alcohol can delay the rate of absorption of nutrients 88 after absorption alcohol reaches the liver where it is metabolized breathalyzersedit alcohol that is not processed by the liver goes to the heart the liver can process only a certain amount of alcohol per unit time thus when a person drinks too much alcohol more alcohol can reach the heart in the heart alcohol reduces the force of heart contractions consequently the heart will pump less blood lowering overall body blood pressure 53 also blood that reaches the heart goes to the lungs to replenish bloods oxygen concentration it is at this stage that a person can breathe out traces of alcohol 53 this is the underlying principle of the alcohol breath testing or breathalyzers to determine if a driver has been drinking and driving 89 from the lungs blood returns to the heart and will be distributed throughout the body interestingly alcohol increases levels of high-density lipoproteinshdls which carry cholesterol 53 alcohol is known to make blood less likely to clot reducing risk of heart attack and stroke this could be the reason that alcohol seems to produce health benefits when consumed in moderate amounts 90 also alcohol dilates blood vessels consequently a person will feel warmer and hisher skin flush and appear pink 53 magnitude of effectsedit some individuals have less effective forms of one or both of the metabolizing enzymes and can experience more severe symptoms from ethanol consumption than others however those having acquired alcohol tolerance have a greater quantity of these enzymes and metabolize ethanol more rapidly 91 chemistryedit chemical formulaedit ethanol is a 2-carbon alcohol its molecular formula is ch3ch2oh an alternative notation is ch3ch2oh which indicates that the carbon of a methyl group ch3 is attached to the carbon of a methylene group ch2 which is attached to the oxygen of a hydroxyl group oh it is a constitutional isomer of dimethyl ether ethanol is sometimes abbreviated as etoh using the common organic chemistry notation of representing the ethyl group c2h5- with et physical propertiesedit ethanol is a volatile colorless liquid that has a slight odor it burns with a smokeless blue flame that is not always visible in normal light the physical properties of ethanol stem primarily from the presence of its hydroxyl group and the shortness of its carbon chain ethanols hydroxyl group is able to participate in hydrogen bonding rendering it more viscous and less volatile than less polar organic compounds of similar molecular weight such as propane ethanol is slightly more refractive than water having a refractive index of 1.36242 at λ=589.3nm and 18.35c or 65.03f 92 the triple point for ethanol is 150 k at a pressure of 4.3  10−4 pa 93 solvent propertiesedit ethanol is a versatile solvent miscible with water and with many organic solvents including acetic acid acetone benzene carbon tetrachloride chloroform diethyl ether ethylene glycol glycerol nitromethane pyridine and toluene 92 94 it is also miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane and hexane and with aliphatic chlorides such as trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene 94 ethanols miscibility with water contrasts with the immiscibility of longer-chain alcohols five or more carbon atoms whose water miscibility decreases sharply as the number of carbons increases 95 the miscibility of ethanol with alkanes is limited to alkanes up to undecane mixtures with dodecane and higher alkanes show a miscibility gap below a certain temperature about 13c for dodecane 96 the miscibility gap tends to get wider with higher alkanes and the temperature for complete miscibility increases ethanol-water mixtures have less volume than the sum of their individual components at the given fractions mixing equal volumes of ethanol and water results in only 1.92 volumes of mixture 92 97 mixing ethanol and water is exothermic with up to 777jmol 98 being released at 298k mixtures of ethanol and water form an azeotrope at about 89 mole- ethanol and 11 mole- water 99 or a mixture of 95.6 percent ethanol by mass or about 97 alcohol by volume at normal pressure which boils at 351k  78c this azeotropic composition is strongly temperature- and pressure-dependent and vanishes at temperatures below 303k 100 hydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be hygroscopic to the extent that it readily absorbs water from the air the polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds notably sodium and potassium hydroxides magnesium chloride calcium chloride ammonium chloride ammonium bromide and sodium bromide 94 sodium and potassium chlorides are slightly soluble in ethanol 94 because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end it will also dissolve nonpolar substances including most essential oils 101 and numerous flavoring coloring and medicinal agents the addition of even a few percent of ethanol to water sharply reduces the surface tension of water this property partially explains the tears of wine phenomenon when wine is swirled in a glass ethanol evaporates quickly from the thin film of wine on the wall of the glass as the wines ethanol content decreases its surface tension increases and the thin film beads up and runs down the glass in channels rather than as a smooth sheet flammabilityedit an ethanol-water solution that contains 40 alcohol by weight will catch fire if heated to about 26c  79f and if an ignition source is applied to it this is called its flash point 102 the flash point of pure ethanol is 16.60c  61.88f less than average room temperature dishes using burning alcohol for culinary effects are called flambé natural occurrenceedit ethanol is a byproduct of the metabolic process of yeast as such ethanol will be present in any yeast habitat ethanol can commonly be found in overripe fruit 104 ethanol produced by symbiotic yeast can be found in bertam palm blossoms although some animal species such as the pentailed treeshrew exhibit ethanol-seeking behaviors most show no interest or avoidance of food sources containing ethanol 105 ethanol is also produced during the germination of many plants as a result of natural anerobiosis 106 ethanol has been detected in outer space forming an icy coating around dust grains in interstellar clouds 107 minute quantity amounts average 196 ppb of endogenous ethanol and acetaldehyde were found in the exhaled breath of healthy volunteers 108 auto-brewery syndrome also known as gut fermentation syndrome is a rare medical condition in which intoxicating quantities of ethanol are produced through endogenous fermentation within the digestive system 109 productionedit ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical through the hydration of ethylene and via biological processes by fermenting sugars with yeast 110 which process is more economical depends on prevailing prices of petroleum and grain feed stocks ethylene hydrationedit ethanol for use as an industrial feedstock or solvent sometimes referred to as synthetic ethanol is made from petrochemical feed stocks primarily by the acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene the catalyst is most commonly phosphoric acid 111 112 adsorbed onto a porous support such as silica gel or diatomaceous earth this catalyst was first used for large-scale ethanol production by the shell oil company in 1947 113 the reaction is carried out in the presence of high pressure steam at 300c  572f where a 1.0:0.6 ethylene to steam ratio is maintained 114 115 in the us this process was used on an industrial scale by union carbide corporation and others but now only lyondellbasell uses it commercially in an older process first practiced on the industrial scale in 1930 by union carbide 116 but now almost entirely obsolete ethylene was hydrated indirectly by reacting it with concentrated sulfuric acid to produce ethyl sulfate which was hydrolyzed to yield ethanol and regenerate the sulfuric acid 117 fermentationedit ethanol in alcoholic beverages and fuel is produced by fermentation certain species of yeast eg saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolize sugar producing ethanol and carbon dioxide the chemical equations below summarize the conversion fermentation is the process of culturing yeast under favorable thermal conditions to produce alcohol this process is carried out at around 35–40c  95–104f toxicity of ethanol to yeast limits the ethanol concentration obtainable by brewing higher concentrations therefore are obtained by fortification or distillation the most ethanol-tolerant yeast strains can survive up to approximately 18 ethanol by volume to produce ethanol from starchy materials such as cereal grains the starch must first be converted into sugars in brewing beer this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate or malt which produces the enzyme amylase when the malted grain is mashed the amylase converts the remaining starches into sugars celluloseedit sugars for ethanol fermentation can be obtained from cellulose deployment of this technology could turn a number of cellulose-containing agricultural by-products such as corncobs straw and sawdust into renewable energy resources other agricultural residues such as sugar cane bagasse and energy crops such as switchgrass may also be a sources of fermentable sugars 118 testingedit breweries and biofuel plants employ two methods for measuring ethanol concentration infrared ethanol sensors measure the vibrational frequency of dissolved ethanol using the ch band at 2900cm−1 this method uses a relatively inexpensive solid state sensor that compares the ch band with a reference band to calculate the ethanol content the calculation makes use of the beer-lambert law alternatively by measuring the density of the starting material and the density of the product using a hydrometer the change in specific gravity during fermentation indicates the alcohol content this inexpensive and indirect method has a long history in the beer brewing industry purificationedit distillationedit ethylene hydration or brewing produces an ethanolwater mixture for most industrial and fuel uses the ethanol must be purified fractional distillation at atmospheric pressure can concentrate ethanol to 95.6 by volume  89.5 mole this mixture is an azeotrope with a boiling point of 78.1c  172.6f and cannot be further purified by distillation addition of an entraining agent such as benzene cyclohexane or heptane allows a new ternary azeotrope comprising the ethanol water and the entraining agent to be formed this lower-boiling ternary azeotrope is removed preferentially leading to water-free ethanol 112 at pressures less than atmospheric pressure the composition of the ethanol-water azeotrope shifts to more ethanol-rich mixtures and at pressures less than 70torr  9.333kpa there is no azeotrope and it is possible to distill absolute ethanol from an ethanol-water mixture while vacuum distillation of ethanol is not presently economical pressure-swing distillation is a topic of current research in this technique a reduced-pressure distillation first yields an ethanol-water mixture of more than 95.6 ethanol then fractional distillation of this mixture at atmospheric pressure distills off the 95.6 azeotrope leaving anhydrous ethanol at the bottomcitation needed molecular sieves and desiccantsedit apart from distillation ethanol may be dried by addition of a desiccant such as molecular sieves cellulose and cornmeal the desiccants can be dried and reused 112 molecular sieves can be used to selectively absorb the water from the 95.6 ethanol solution synthetic zeolite in pellet form can be used as well as a variety of plant-derived absorbents including cornmeal straw and sawdust the zeolite bed can be regenerated essentially an unlimited number of times by drying it with a blast of hot carbon dioxide cornmeal and other plant-derived absorbents cannot readily be regenerated but where ethanol is made from grain they are often available at low cost absolute ethanol produced this way has no residual benzene and can be used to fortify port and sherry in traditional winery operations membranes and reverse osmosisedit membranes can also be used to separate ethanol and water membrane-based separations are not subject to the limitations of the water-ethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vapor-liquid equilibria membranes are often used in the so-called hybrid membrane distillation process this process uses a pre-concentration distillation column as first separating step the further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor permeation or pervaporation mode vapor permeation uses a vapor membrane feed and pervaporation uses a liquid membrane feed other techniquesedit a variety of other techniques have been discussed including the following 112 direct electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to ethanol under ambient conditions using copper nanoparticles on a carbon nanospike film as the catalyst 119 extraction of ethanol from grain mash by supercritical carbon dioxide pervaporation fractional freezing is also used to concentrate fermented alcoholic solutions such as traditionally made applejack beverage pressure swing adsorption 120 grades of ethanoledit denatured alcoholedit pure ethanol and alcoholic beverages are heavily taxed as psychoactive drugs but ethanol has many uses that do not involve its consumption to relieve the tax burden on these uses most jurisdictions waive the tax when an agent has been added to the ethanol to render it unfit to drink these include bittering agents such as denatonium benzoate and toxins such as methanol naphtha and pyridine products of this kind are called denatured alcohol 121 122 absolute alcoholedit absolute or anhydrous alcohol refers to ethanol with a low water content there are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1 to a few parts per million ppm levels if azeotropic distillation is used to remove water it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent eg benzene 123 absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption absolute ethanol is used as a solvent for laboratory and industrial applications where water will react with other chemicals and as fuel alcohol spectroscopic ethanol is an absolute ethanol with a low absorbance in ultraviolet and visible light fit for use as a solvent in ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 124 pure ethanol is classed as 200 proof in the us equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the uk system 125 rectified spiritsedit rectified spirit an azeotropic composition of 96 ethanol containing 4 water is used instead of anhydrous ethanol for various purposes wine spirits are about 94 ethanol  188 proof the impurities are different from those in 95  190 proof laboratory ethanol 126 reactionsedit ethanol is classified as a primary alcohol meaning that the carbon its hydroxyl group attaches to has at least two hydrogen atoms attached to it as well many ethanol reactions occur at its hydroxyl group ester formationedit in the presence of acid catalysts ethanol reacts with carboxylic acids to produce ethyl esters and water this reaction which is conducted on large scale industrially requires the removal of the water from the reaction mixture as it is formed esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and a salt this reaction is known as saponification because it is used in the preparation of soap ethanol can also form esters with inorganic acids diethyl sulfate and triethyl phosphate are prepared by treating ethanol with sulfur trioxide and phosphorus pentoxide respectively diethyl sulfate is a useful ethylating agent in organic synthesis ethyl nitrite prepared from the reaction of ethanol with sodium nitrite and sulfuric acid was formerly used as a diuretic dehydrationedit strong acid desiccants cause the partial dehydration of ethanol to form diethyl ether and other byproducts if the dehydration temperature exceeds around 160c  320f full dehydration will occur and ethylene will be the main product combustionedit complete combustion of ethanol forms carbon dioxide and water specific heat  2.44 kjkgk acid-base chemistryedit ethanol is a neutral molecule and the ph of a solution of ethanol in water is nearly 7.00 ethanol can be quantitatively converted to its conjugate base the ethoxide ion ch3ch2o by reaction with an alkali metal such as sodium 95 or a very strong base such as sodium hydride the acidity of water and ethanol are nearly the same as indicated by their pka of 15.7 and 16 respectively thus sodium ethoxide and sodium hydroxide exist in an equilibrium that is closely balanced halogenationedit ethanol is not used industrially as a precursor to ethyl halides but the reactions are illustrative ethanol reacts with hydrogen halides to produce ethyl halides such as ethyl chloride and ethyl bromide via an sn2 reaction these reactions require a catalyst such as zinc chloride 117 hbr requires refluxing with a sulfuric acid catalyst 117 ethyl halides can in principle also be produced by treating ethanol with more specialized halogenating agents such as thionyl chloride or phosphorus tribromide 95 117 upon treatment with halogens in the presence of base ethanol gives the corresponding haloform chx3 where x  cl br i this conversion is called the haloform reaction 129  an intermediate in the reaction with chlorine is the aldehyde called chloral which forms chloral hydrate upon reaction with water 130 oxidationedit ethanol can be oxidized to acetaldehyde and further oxidized to acetic acid depending on the reagents and conditions 117 this oxidation is of no importance industrially but in the human body these oxidation reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme liver alcohol dehydrogenase the oxidation product of ethanol acetic acid is a nutrient for humans being a precursor to acetyl coa where the acetyl group can be spent as energy or used for biosynthesis historyedit the fermentation of sugar into ethanol is one of the earliest biotechnologies employed by humans the intoxicating effects of ethanol consumption have been known since ancient times ethanol has been used by humans since prehistory as the intoxicating ingredient of alcoholic beverages dried residue on 9,000-year-old pottery found in china suggests that neolithic people consumed alcoholic beverages 131 although distillation was well known by the early greeks and arabs the first recorded production of alcohol from distilled wine was by the school of salerno alchemists in the 12th century 132 the first to mention absolute alcohol in contrast with alcohol-water mixtures was raymond lull 132 in 1796 german-russian chemist johann tobias lowitzde obtained pure ethanol by mixing partially purified ethanol the alcohol-water azeotrope with an excess of anhydrous alkali and then distilling the mixture over low heat 133 french chemist antoine lavoisier described ethanol as a compound of carbon hydrogen and oxygen and in 1807 nicolas-théodore de saussure determined ethanols chemical formula 134 135 fifty years later archibald scott couper published the structural formula of ethanol it was one of the first structural formulas determined 136 ethanol was first prepared synthetically in 1825 by michael faraday he found that sulfuric acid could absorb large volumes of coal gas 137 he gave the resulting solution to henry hennell a british chemist who found in 1826 that it contained sulphovinic acid ethyl hydrogen sulfate 138 in 1828 hennell and the french chemist georges-simon serullas independently discovered that sulphovinic acid could be decomposed into ethanol 139 140 thus in 1825 faraday had unwittingly discovered that ethanol could be produced from ethylene a component of coal gas by acid-catalyzed hydration a process similar to current industrial ethanol synthesis 141 ethanol was used as lamp fuel in the united states as early as 1840 but a tax levied on industrial alcohol during the civil war made this use uneconomical the tax was repealed in 1906 142 use as an automotive fuel dates back to 1908 with the ford model t able to run on petrol gasoline or ethanol 143 it fuels some spirit lamps ethanol intended for industrial use is often produced from ethylene 144 ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption including scents flavorings colorings and medicines in chemistry it is both a solvent and a feedstock for the synthesis of other products it has a long history as a fuel for heat and light and more recently as a fuel for internal combustion engines society and cultureedit a 2002 study found 41 of people fatally injured in traffic accidents were in alcohol related crashes 145 the risk of a fatal car accident increases exponentially with the level of alcohol in the drivers blood 146 most drunk driving laws governing the acceptable levels in the blood while driving or operating heavy machinery set typical upper limits of legal blood alcohol content bac at 0.08 147 see alsoedit pharmacy and pharmacology portal 1-propanol
