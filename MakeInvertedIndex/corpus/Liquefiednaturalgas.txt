liquefied natural gas liquefied natural gas lng is natural gas predominantly methane ch4 with some mixture of ethane c2h6f that has been converted to liquid form for ease of storage or transport it takes up about 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state it is odorless colorless toxic and non-corrosive hazards include flammability after vaporization into a gaseous state freezing and asphyxia the liquefaction process involves removal of certain components such as dust acid gases helium water and heavy hydrocarbons which could cause difficulty downstream the natural gas is then condensed into a liquid at close to atmospheric pressure by cooling it to approximately −162c −260f maximum transport pressure is set at around 25kpa  4psi lng achieves a higher reduction in volume than compressed natural gas cng so that the volumetric energy density of lng is 2.4times greater than that of cng or 60 percent that of diesel fuel 1 this makes lng cost efficient to transport over long distances where pipelines do not exist specially designed cryogenic sea vessels lng carriers or cryogenic road tankers are used for its transport lng is principally used for transporting natural gas to markets where it is regasified and distributed as pipeline natural gas it can be used in natural gas vehicles although it is more common to design vehicles to use compressed natural gas its relatively high cost of production and the need to store it in expensive cryogenic tanks have hindered widespread commercial use despite these drawbacks on energy basis lng production is expected to

the heating value depends on the source of gas that is used and the process that is used to liquefy the gas the range of heating value can span - 10 to 15 percent a typical value of the higher heating value of lng is approximately 50mjkg or 21,500btulb 2 a typical value of the lower heating value of lng is 45mjkg or 19,350btulb for the purpose of comparison of different fuels the heating value may be expressed in terms of energy per volume which is known as the energy density expressed in mjliter the density of lng is roughly 0.41kgliter to 0.5kgliter depending on temperature pressure and composition 3 compared to water at 1.0kgliter using the median value of 0.45kgliter the typical energy density values are 22.5 mjliter based on higher heating value or 20.3 mjliter based on lower heating value the volume-based energy density of lng is approximately 2.4 times greater than that of cng which makes it economical to transport natural gas by ship in the form of lng the energy density of lng is comparable to propane and ethanol but is only 60 percent that of diesel and 70 percent that of gasoline 4 historyedit experiments on the properties of gases started early in the seventeenth century by the middle of the seventeenth century robert boyle had derived the inverse relationship between the pressure and the volume of gases about the same time guillaume amontons started looking into temperature effects on gas various gas experiments continued for the next 200 years during that time there were efforts to liquefy gases many new facts on the nature of gases had been discovered for example early in the nineteenth century cagniard de la tour had shown there was a temperature above which a gas could not be liquefied there was a major push in the mid to late nineteenth century to liquefy all gases a number of scientists including michael faraday james joule and william thomson lord kelvin did experiments in this area in 1886 karol olszewski liquefied methane the primary constituent of natural gas by 1900 all gases had been liquefied except helium which was liquefied in 1908 the first large scale liquefaction of natural gas in the us was in 1918 when the us government liquefied natural gas as a way to extract helium which is a small component of some natural gas this helium was intended for use in british dirigibles for world war i the liquid natural gas lng was not stored but regasified and immediately put into the gas mains 5 the key patents having to do with natural gas liquefaction were in 1915 and the mid-1930s in 1915 godfrey cabot patented a method for storing liquid gases at very low temperatures it consisted of a thermos bottle type design which included a cold inner tank within an outer tank the tanks being separated by insulation in 1937 lee twomey received patents for a process for large scale liquefaction of natural gas the intention was to store natural gas as a liquid so it could be used for shaving peak energy loads during cold snaps because of large volumes it is not practical to store natural gas as a gas near atmospheric pressure however if it can be liquefied it can be stored in a volume 600 times smaller this is a practical way to store it but the gas must be stored at −260f −162c there are two processes for liquefying natural gas in large quantities the first is the cascade process in which the natural gas is cooled by another gas which in turn has been cooled by still another gas hence named the cascade process there are usually two cascade cycles prior to the liquid natural gas cycle the other method is the linde process with a variation of the linde process called the claude process being sometimes used in this process the gas is cooled regeneratively by continually passing it through an orifice until it is cooled to temperatures at which it liquefies the cooling of gas by expanding it through an orifice was developed by james joule and william thomson and is known as the joule-thomson effect lee twomey used the cascade process for his patents commercial operations in the united statesedit the east ohio gas company built a full-scale commercial liquid natural gas lng plant in cleveland ohio in 1940 just after a successful pilot plant built by its sister company hope natural gas company of west virginia this was the first such plant in the world originally it had three spheres approximately 63 feet in diameter containing lng at −260f each sphere held the equivalent of about 50 million cubic feet of natural gas a fourth tank a cylinder was added in 1942 it had an equivalent capacity of 100 million cubic feet of gas the plant operated successfully for three years the stored gas was regasified and put into the mains when cold snaps hit and extra capacity was needed this precluded the denial of gas to some customers during a cold snap the cleveland plant failed on october 20 1944 when the cylindrical tank ruptured spilling thousands of gallons of lng over the plant and nearby neighborhood the gas evaporated and caught fire which caused 130 fatalities 6 the fire delayed further implementation of lng facilities for several years however over the next 15 years new research on low-temperature alloys and better insulation materials set the stage for a revival of the industry it restarted in 1959 when a us world war ii liberty ship the methane pioneer converted to carry lng made a delivery of lng from the us gulf coast to energy starved great britain in june 1964 the worlds first purpose-built lng carrier the methane princess entered service 7 soon after that a large natural gas field was discovered in algeria international trade in lng quickly followed as lng was shipped to france and great britain from the algerian fields one more important attribute of lng had now been exploited once natural gas was liquefied it could not only be stored more easily but it could be transported thus energy could now be shipped over the oceans via lng the same way it was shipped by oil the us lng industry restarted in 1965 when a series of new plants were built in the us the building continued through the 1970s these plants were not only used for peak-shaving as in cleveland but also for base-load supplies for places that never had natural gas prior to this a number of import facilities were built on the east coast in anticipation of the need to import energy via lng however a recent boom in us natural gas production  2010-2014 enabled by hydraulic fracturing fracking has many of these import facilities being considered as export facilities the first us lng export was completed in early 2016 8 productionedit the natural gas fed into the lng plant will be treated to remove water hydrogen sulfide carbon dioxide and other components that will freeze eg benzene under the low temperatures needed for storage or be destructive to the liquefaction facility lng typically contains more than 90 percentmethane it also contains small amounts of ethane propane butane some heavier alkanes and nitrogen the purification process can be designed to give almost 100 percentmethane one of the risks of lng is a rapid phase transition explosion rpt which occurs when cold lng comes into contact with water 9 the most important infrastructure needed for lng production and transportation is an lng plant consisting of one or more lng trains each of which is an independent unit for gas liquefaction the largest lng train now in operation is in qatar these facilities recently reached a safety milestone completing 12 years of operations on its offshore facilities without a lost time incident 10 until recently it was the train 4 of atlantic lng in trinidad and tobago with a production capacity of 5.2 million metric ton per annum mmtpa 11 followed by the segas lng plant in egypt with a capacity of 5mmtpa in july 2014 atlantic lng celebrated its 3000th cargo of lng at the companys liquefaction facility in trinidad 12 the qatargasii plant has a production capacity of 7.8mmtpa for each of its two trains lng sourced from qatargas ii will be supplied to kuwait following the signing of an agreement in may 2014 between qatar liquefied gas company and kuwait petroleum corp 12 lng is loaded onto ships and delivered to a regasification terminal where the lng is allowed to expand and reconvert into gas regasification terminals are usually connected to a storage and pipeline distribution network to distribute natural gas to local distribution companies ldcs or independent power plants ipps lng plant productionedit information for the following table is derived in part from publication by the us energy information administration 13 see also list of lng terminals world total productionedit the lng industry developed slowly during the second half of the last century because most lng plants are located in remote areas not served by pipelines and because of the large costs to treat and transport lng constructing an lng plant costs at least $1.5billion per 1mmtpa capacity a receiving terminal costs $1billion per 1 bcfday throughput capacity and lng vessels cost $200 million$300 million in the early 2000s prices for constructing lng plants receiving terminals and vessels fell as new technologies emerged and more players invested in liquefaction and regasification this tended to make lng more competitive as a means of energy distribution but increasing material costs and demand for construction contractors have put upward pressure on prices in the last few years the standard price for a 125,000 cubic meter lng vessel built in european and japanese shipyards used to be us$250million when korean and chinese shipyards entered the race increased competition reduced profit margins and improved efficiencyreducing costs by 60 percent costs in us dollars also declined due to the devaluation of the currencies of the worlds largest shipbuilders the japanese yen and korean won since 2004 the large number of orders increased demand for shipyard slots raising their price and increasing ship costs the per-ton construction cost of an lng liquefaction plant fell steadily from the 1970s through the 1990s the cost reduced by approximately 35 percent however recently the cost of building liquefaction and regasification terminals doubled due to increased cost of materials and a shortage of skilled labor professional engineers designers managers and other white-collar professionals due to natural gas shortage concerns in the northeastern us and surplus nature gas in the rest of the country many new lng import and export terminals are being contemplated in the united states concerns about the safety of such facilities create controversy in some regions where they are proposed one such location is in the long island sound between connecticut and long island broadwater energy an effort of transcanada corp and shell wishes to build an lng import terminal in the sound on the new york side local politicians including the suffolk county executive raised questions about the terminal in 2005 new york senators chuck schumer and hillary clinton also announced their opposition to the project 19 several import terminal proposals along the coast of maine were also met with high levels of resistance and questions on sep 13 2013 the us department of energy approved dominion cove points application to export up to 770 million cubic feet per day of lng to countries that do not have a free trade agreement with the us 20 in may 2014 the ferc concluded its environmental assessment of the cove point lng project which found that the proposed natural gas export project could be built and operated safely 21 another lng terminal is currently proposed for elba island ga 22 plans for three lng export terminals in the us gulf coast region have also received conditional federal approval 20 23 in canada an lng export terminal is under construction near guysborough nova scotia 24 commercial aspectsedit global tradeedit in the commercial development of an lng value chain lng suppliers first confirm sales to the downstream buyers and then sign long-term contracts typically 20–25 years with strict terms and structures for gas pricing only when the customers are confirmed and the development of a greenfield project deemed economically feasible could the sponsors of an lng project invest in their development and operation thus the lng liquefaction business has been limited to players with strong financial and political resources major international oil companies iocs such as exxonmobil royal dutch shell bp bg group chevron and national oil companies nocs such as pertamina and petronas are active players lng is shipped around the world in specially constructed seagoing vessels the trade of lng is completed by signing an spa sale and purchase agreement between a supplier and receiving terminal and by signing a gsa gas sale agreement between a receiving terminal and end-users most of the contract terms used to be des or ex ship holding the seller responsible for the transport of the gas with low shipbuilding costs and the buyers preferring to ensure reliable and stable supply however contracts with fob terms increased under such terms the buyer who often owns a vessel or signs a long-term charter agreement with independent carriers is responsible for the transport lng purchasing agreements used to be for a long term with relatively little flexibility both in price and volume if the annual contract quantity is confirmed the buyer is obliged to take and pay for the product or pay for it even if not taken in what is referred to as the obligation of take-or-pay contract top in the mid-1990s lng was a buyers market at the request of buyers the spas began to adopt some flexibilities on volume and price the buyers had more upward and downward flexibilities in top and short-term spas less than 16 years came into effect at the same time alternative destinations for cargo and arbitrage were also allowed by the turn of the 21st century the market was again in favor of sellers however sellers have become more sophisticated and are now proposing sharing of arbitrage opportunities and moving away from s-curve pricing there has been much discussion regarding the creation of an ogec as a natural gas equivalent of opec russia and qatar countries with the largest and the third largest natural gas reserves in the world have finally supported such movecitation needed until 2003 lng prices have closely followed oil prices since then lng prices in europe and japan have been lower than oil prices although the link between lng and oil is still strong in contrast prices in the us and the uk have recently skyrocketed then fallen as a result of changes in supply and storagecitation needed in late 1990s and in early 2000s the market shifted for buyers but since 2003 and 2004 it has been a strong sellers market with net-back as the best estimation for pricescitation needed research from qnb group in 2014 shows that robust global demand is likely to keep lng prices high for at least the next few years 25 the current surge in unconventional oil and gas in the us has resulted in lower gas prices in the us this has led to discussions in asia oil linked gas markets to import gas based on henry hub index 26 recent high level conference in vancouver the pacific energy summit 2013 pacific energy summit 2013 convened policy makers and experts from asia and the us to discuss lng trade relations between these regions receiving terminals exist in about 18 countries including india japan korea taiwan china greece belgium spain italy france the uk the us chile and the dominican republic among others plans exist for argentina brazil uruguay canada ukraine and others to also construct new receiving gasification terminals lng project screeningedit base load large scale >1 mtpa lng projects require natural gas reserves 27 buyers 28 and financing using proven technology and a proven contractor is extremely important for both investors and buyers 29 gas reserves required 1 tcf of gas required per mtpa of lng over 20 years 27 usesedit the primary use of lng is to simplify transport of natural gas from the source to a destination on the large scale this is done when the source and the destination are across an ocean from each other it can also be used when adequate pipeline capacity is not available for large scale transport uses the lng is typically regassified at the receiving end and pushed into the local natural gas pipeline infrastructure - lng can also be used to meet peak demand when the normal pipeline infrastructure can meet most demand needs but not the peak demand needs these plants are typically called lng peak shaving plants as the purpose is to shave off part of the peak demand from what is required out of the supply pipeline - lng can be used to fuel internal combustion engines lng is in the early stages of becoming a mainstream fuel for transportation needs it is being evaluated and tested for over-the-road trucking 30 off-road 31 marine and train applications 32 there are known problems with the fuel tanks and delivery of gas to the engine 33 but despite these concerns the move to lng as a transportation fuel has begun  use of lng to fuel large over-the-road trucksedit china has been a leader in the use of lng vehicles 34 with over 100,000 lng powered vehicles on the road as of sept 2014 35 in the united states the beginnings of a public lng fueling capability is being put in place an alternative fuelling centre tracking site shows 81 public truck lng fuel centres as of aug 2016 36 the 2013 national truckers directory lists approximately 7,000 truckstops 37 thus approximately 1 of us truckstops have lng available as of december 2014 lng fuel and ngvs have not been taken to very quickly within europe and it is questionable whether lng will ever become the fuel of choice among fleet operators 38 during the year 2015 netherlands introduced lng powered trucks in transport sector 39 australian government is planning to develop an lng highway to utilise the locally produced lng and replace the imported diesel fuel used by interstate haulage vehicles 40 in the year 2015 india also made small beginning by transporting lng by lng powered road tankers in kerala state 41 japan the worlds largest importer of lng is set to use of lng as road transport fuel 42 use of lng to fuel high-horsepowerhigh-torque enginesedit in internal combustion engines the volume of the cylinders is a common measure of the power of an engine thus a 2000cc engine would typically be more powerful than a 1800cc engine but that assumes a similar air-fuel mixture is used also if via a turbocharger as an example the 1800cc engine were using an air-fuel mixture that was significantly more energy dense then it might be able to produce more power than a 2000cc engine burning a less energy dense air-fuel mixture unfortunately turbochargers are both complex and expensive thus it becomes clear for high-horsepowerhigh-torque engines a fuel that can inherently be used to create a more energy dense air-fuel mixture is preferred because a smaller and simpler engine can be used to produce the same power with traditional gasoline and diesel engines the energy density of the air-fuel mixture is limited because the liquid fuels do not mix well in the cylinder further gasoline and diesel auto-ignite 43 at temperatures and pressures relevant to engine design an important part of traditional engine design is designing the cylinders compression ratios and fuel injectors such that pre-ignition is avoided 44 but at the same time as much fuel as possible can be injected become well mixed and still have time to complete the combustion process during the power stroke natural gas does not auto-ignite at pressures and temperatures relevant to traditional gasoline and diesel engine design thus providing more flexibility in the design of a natural gas engine methane the main component of natural gas has an autoignition temperature of 580c/1076f 45 whereas gasoline and diesel autoignite at approximately 250c and 210c respectively with a compressed natural gas cng engine the mixing of the fuel and the air is more effective since gases typically mix well in a short period of time but at typical cng compression pressures the fuel itself is less energy dense than gas or diesel thus the end result is a lower energy dense air-fuel mixture thus for the same cylinder displacement engine a non turbocharged cng powered engine is typically less powerful than a similarly sized gas or diesel engine for that reason turbochargers are popular on european cng cars 46 despite that limitation the 12 liter cummins westport isx12g engine 47 is an example of a cng capable engine designed to pull tractortrailer loads up to 80,000 lbs showing cng can be used in most if not all on-road truck applications the original isx g engines incorporated a turbocharger to enhance the air-fuel energy density 48 lng offers a unique advantage over cng for more demanding high-horsepower applications by eliminating the need for a turbocharger because lng boils at approximately -160c by using a simple heat exchanger a small amount of lng can be converted to its gaseous form at extremely high pressure with the use of little or no mechanical energy a properly designed high-horsepower engine can leverage this extremely high pressure energy dense gaseous fuel source to create a higher energy density air-fuel mixture than can be efficiently created with a cng powered engine the end result when compared to cng engines is more overall efficiency in high-horsepower engine applications when high-pressure direct injection technology is used the westport hdmi2 49 fuel system is an example of a high-pressure direct injection technology that does not require a turbocharger if teamed with appropriate lng heat exchanger technology the volvo trucks 13-liter lng engine 50 is another example of a lng engine leveraging advanced high pressure technology westport recommends cng for engines 7 liters or smaller and lng with direct injection for engines between 20 and 150 liters for engines between 7 and 20 liters either option is recommended see slide 13 from there ngv bruxelles  industry innovation session presentation 51 container shipping company maersk group has decided to introduce lng fuel driven container ships 52 deme group has contracted wärtsilä to power its new generation antigoon class dredger with dual fuel df engines 53 high horsepower engines in the oil drilling mining locomotive and marine fields have been or are being developed 54 paul blomerous has written a paper 55 concluding as much as 40 million tonnes per annum of lng approximately 26.1 billion gallonsyear or 71 million gallonsday could be required just to meet the global needs of the high-horsepower engines by 2025 to 2030 as of the end of 1st quarter 2015 prometheus energy group inc claims to have delivered over 100 million gallons of lng within the previous 4 years into the industrial market 56 and is continuing to add new customers tradeedit the global trade in lng is growing rapidly from negligible in 1970 to what is expected to be a globally meaningful amount by 2020 as a reference the 2014 global production of crude oil was 92 million barrels per day 57 or 186.4 quadsyr quadrillion btusyr in 1970 global lng trade was of 3 billion cubic metres bcm  0.11 quads 58 in 2011 it was 331 bcm  11.92 quads 58 the us started exporting lng in february 2016 the black  veatch oct 2014 forecast is that by 2020 the us alone will export between 10 bcfd  3.75 quadsyr and 14 bcfd  5.25 quadsyr 59 ey projects global lng demand could hit 400 mtpa  19.7 quads by 2020 60 if that occurs the lng market will be roughly 10 the size of the global crude oil market and that does not count the vast majority of natural gas which is delivered via pipeline directly from the well to the consumer in 2004 lng accounted for 7 percent of the worlds natural gas demand 61 the global trade in lng which has increased at a rate of 7.4 percent per year over the decade from 1995 to 2005 is expected to continue to grow substantially 62 lng trade is expected to increase at 6.7 percent per year from 2005 to 2020 62 until the mid-1990s lng demand was heavily concentrated in northeast asia japan south korea and taiwan at the same time pacific basin supplies dominated world lng trade 62 the world-wide interest in using natural gas-fired combined cycle generating units for electric power generation coupled with the inability of north american and north sea natural gas supplies to meet the growing demand substantially broadened the regional markets for lng it also brought new atlantic basin and middle east suppliers into the trade 62 by the end of 2011 there were 18 lng exporting countries and 25 lng importing countries the three biggest lng exporters in 2011 were qatar  75.5 mt malaysia  25 mt and indonesia  21.4 mt the three biggest lng importers in 2011 were japan  78.8 mt south korea  35 mt and uk  18.6 mt 63 lng trade volumes increased from 140 mt in 2005 to 158 mt in 2006 165 mt in 2007 172 mt in 2008 64 global lng production was 246 mt in 2014 65 most of which was used in trade between countries 66 during the next several years there would be significant increase in volume of lng trade 60 for example about 59 mtpa of new lng supply from six new plants came to market just in 2009 including northwest shelf train 5 4.4 mtpa sakhalin ii 9.6 mtpa yemen lng 6.7 mtpa tangguh 7.6 mtpa qatargas 15.6 mtpa rasgas qatar 15.6 mtpa in 2006 qatar became the worlds biggest exporter of lng 58 as of 2012 qatar is the source of 25 percent of the worlds lng exports 58 investments in us export facilities were increasing by 2013 these investments were spurred by increasing shale gas production in the united states and a large price differential between natural gas prices in the us and those in europe and asia cheniere energy became the first company in the united states to receive permission and export lng in 2016 8 importsedit in 1964 the uk and france made the first lng trade buying gas from algeria witnessing a new era of energy today only 19 countries export lng 58 compared with the crude oil market in 2013 the natural gas market was about 72 percent of the crude oil market measured on a heat equivalent basis 67 of which lng forms a small but rapidly growing part much of this growth is driven by the need for clean fuel and some substitution effect due to the high price of oil primarily in the heating and electricity generation sectors japan south korea spain france italy and taiwan import large volumes of lng due to their shortage of energy in 2005 japan imported 58.6 million tons of lng representing some 30 percent of the lng trade around the world that year also in 2005 south korea imported 22.1 million tons and in 2004 taiwan imported 6.8 million tons these three major buyers purchase approximately two-thirds of the worlds lng demand in addition spain imported some 8.2 mmtpa in 2006 making it the third largest importer france also imported similar quantities as spaincitation needed following the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster in march 2011 japan became a major importer accounting for one third of the total 68 european lng imports fell by 30 percent in 2012 and are expected to fall further by 24 percent in 2013 as south american and asian importers pay more 69 cargo diversionedit based on the lng spas lng is destined for pre-agreed destinations and diversion of that lng is not allowed however if seller and buyer make a mutual agreement then the diversion of the cargo is permittedsubject to sharing the additional profit created by such a diversion in the european union and some other jurisdictions it is not permitted to apply the profit-sharing clause in lng spas cost of lng plantsedit for an extended period of time design improvements in liquefaction plants and tankers had the effect of reducing costs in the 1980s the cost of building an lng liquefaction plant cost $350 per tpa tonne per year in 2000s it was $200tpa in 2012 the costs can go as high as $1,000tpa partly due to the increase in the price of steel 58 as recently as 2003 it was common to assume that this was a learning curve effect and would continue into the future but this perception of steadily falling costs for lng has been dashed in the last several years 62 the construction cost of greenfield lng projects started to skyrocket from 2004 afterward and has increased from about $400 per ton per year of capacity to $1,000 per ton per year of capacity in 2008 the main reasons for skyrocketed costs in lng industry can be described as follows the 2007–2008 global financial crisis caused a general decline in raw material and equipment prices which somewhat lessened the construction cost of lng plants however by 2012 this was more than offset by increasing demand for materials and labor for the lng market small-scale liquefaction plantsedit small-scale liquefaction plants are suitable for peakshaving on natural gas pipelines transportation fuel or for deliveries of natural gas to remote areas not connected to pipelines 70 they typically have a compact size are fed from a natural gas pipeline and are located close to the location where the lng will be used this proximity decreases transportation and lng product costs for consumers 71 72 it also avoids the additional greenhouse gas emissions generated during long transportation the small-scale lng plant also allows localized peakshaving to occurbalancing the availability of natural gas during high and low periods of demand it also makes it possible for communities without access to natural gas pipelines to install local distribution systems and have them supplied with stored lng 73 lng pricingedit there are three major pricing systems in the current lng contracts oil indexed contract used primarily in japan korea taiwan and china oil oil products and other energy carriers indexed contracts used primarily in continental europe 74 and market indexed contracts used in the us and the uk the formula for an indexed price is as follows cp  bp  β x bp constant part or base price β gradient x indexation the formula has been widely used in asian lng spas where base price refers to a term that represents various non-oil factors but usually a constant determined by negotiation at a level which can prevent lng prices from falling below a certain level it thus varies regardless of oil price fluctuation henry hub plusedit some lng buyers have already signed contracts for future us-based cargos at henry hub-linked prices 75 cheniere energys lng export contract pricing consists of a fixed fee liquefaction tolling fee plus 115 of henry hub per mmbtu of lng 76 tolling fees in the cheniere contracts vary $2.25mmbtu with bg group signed in 2011 $2.49mmbtu with spains gnf signed in 2012 and $3.00mmbtu with south koreas kogas and centrica signed in 2013 77 oil parityedit oil parity is the lng price that would be equal to that of crude oil on a barrel of oil equivalent basis if the lng price exceeds the price of crude oil in boe terms then the situation is called broken oil parity a coefficient of 0.1724 results in full oil parity in most cases the price of lng is less than the price of crude oil in boe terms in 2009 in several spot cargo deals especially in east asia oil parity approached the full oil parity or even exceeds oil parity 78 in january 2016 the spot lng price  5.461 usmmbtu has broken oil parity when the brent crude price ≤32 usbbl has fallen steeply 79 by the end of june 2016 lng price has fallen by nearly 50 below its oil parity price making it more economical than more polluting dieselgas oil in transport sector 80 s-curveedit many formulae include an s-curve where the price formula is different above and below a certain oil price to dampen the impact of high oil prices on the buyer and low oil prices on the seller bulk of the lng trade is governed by long term contracts when the spot lng prices are cheaper than long term oil price indexed contracts profitable lng end use is to power mobile engines for replacing costly gasoline and diesel consumption jcc and icpedit in most of the east asian lng contracts price formula is indexed to a basket of crude imported to japan called the japan crude cocktail jcc in indonesian lng contracts price formula is linked to indonesian crude price icp brent and other energy carriersedit in continental europe the price formula indexation does not follow the same format and it varies from contract to contract brent crude price b heavy fuel oil price hfo light fuel oil price lfo gas oil price go coal price electricity price and in some cases consumer and producer price indexes are the indexation elements of price formulas price reviewedit usually there exists a clause allowing parties to trigger the price revision or price reopening in lng spas in some contracts there are two options for triggering a price revision regular and special regular ones are the dates that will be agreed and defined in the lng spas for the purpose of price review quality of lngedit lng quality is one of the most important issues in the lng business any gas which does not conform to the agreed specifications in the sale and purchase agreement is regarded as off-specification off-spec or off-quality gas or lng quality regulations serve three purposes 81 in the case of off-spec gas or lng the buyer can refuse to accept the gas or lng and the seller has to pay liquidated damages for the respective off-spec gas volumes the quality of gas or lng is measured at delivery point by using an instrument such as a gas chromatograph the most important gas quality concerns involve the sulphur and mercury content and the calorific value due to the sensitivity of liquefaction facilities to sulfur and mercury elements the gas being sent to the liquefaction process shall be accurately refined and tested in order to assure the minimum possible concentration of these two elements before entering the liquefaction plant hence there is not much concern about them however the main concern is the heating value of gas usually natural gas markets can be divided in three markets in terms of heating value 81 asia japan korea taiwan where gas distributed is rich with a gross calorific value gcv higher than 43 mjm3n ie 1,090 btuscf the uk and the us where distributed gas is lean with a gcv usually lower than 42 mjm3n ie 1,065 btuscf continental europe where the acceptable gcv range is quite wide approx 39 to 46 mjm3n ie 990 to 1,160 btuscf there are some methods to modify the heating value of produced lng to the desired level for the purpose of increasing the heating value injecting propane and butane is a solution for the purpose of decreasing heating value nitrogen injecting and extracting butane and propane are proved solutions blending with gas or lng can be a solutions however all of these solutions while theoretically viable can be costly and logistically difficult to manage in large scale lean lng price in terms of mmbtu is lower to the rich lng price 82 liquefaction technologyedit there are several liquefaction processes available for large baseload lng plants 83 it was expected that by the end of 2012 there will be 100 liquefaction trains on stream with total capacity of 297.2 mtyear mmtpa the majority of these trains use either apci ap-c3mrtm or cascade technology for the liquefaction process the other processes used in a small minority of some liquefaction plants include shells dmr double-mixed refrigerant technology and the linde technology apci technology is the most-used liquefaction process in lng plants out of 100 liquefaction trains onstream or under-construction 86 trains with a total capacity of 243 mmtpa have been designed based on the apci process philips cascade process is the second most-used used in 10 trains with a total capacity of 36.16 mmtpa the shell dmr process has been used in three trains with total capacity of 13.9 mmtpa and finally the lindestatoil process is used in the snohvit 4.2 mmtpa single train floating liquefied natural gas flng facilities float above an offshore gas field and produce liquefy store and transfer lng and potentially lpg and condensate at sea before carriers ship it directly to markets the first flng facility is now in development by shell 84 due for completion in around 2017 85 storageedit modern lng storage tanks are typically full containment type which has a prestressed concrete outer wall and a high-nickel steel inner tank with extremely efficient insulation between the walls large tanks are low aspect ratio height to width and cylindrical in design with a domed steel or concrete roof storage pressure in these tanks is very low less than 10kpa  1.45psig sometimes more expensive underground tanks are used for storage smaller quantities say 700m3  190,000 usgallons and less may be stored in horizontal or vertical vacuum-jacketed pressure vessels these tanks may be at pressures anywhere from less than 50kpa to over 1,700kpa  7psig to 250psig lng must be kept cold to remain a liquid independent of pressure despite efficient insulation there will inevitably be some heat leakage into the lng resulting in vaporisation of the lng this boil-off gas acts to keep the lng cold the boil-off gas is typically compressed and exported as natural gas or it is reliquefied and returned to storage transportationedit lng is transported in specially designed ships with double hulls protecting the cargo systems from damage or leaks there are several special leak test methods available to test the integrity of an lng vessels membrane cargo tanks 86 the tankers cost around us$200 million each 58 transportation and supply is an important aspect of the gas business since natural gas reserves are normally quite distant from consumer markets natural gas has far more volume than oil to transport and most gas is transported by pipelines there is a natural gas pipeline network in the former soviet union europe and north america natural gas is less dense even at higher pressures natural gas will travel much faster than oil through a high-pressure pipeline but can transmit only about a fifth of the amount of energy per day due to the lower density natural gas is usually liquefied to lng at the end of the pipeline prior to shipping short lng pipelines for use in moving product from lng vessels to onshore storage are available longer pipelines which allow vessels to offload lng at a greater distance from port facilities are under development this requires pipe in pipe technology due to requirements for keeping the lng cold 87 lng is transported using both tanker truck 88 railway tanker and purpose built ships known as lng carriers lng will be sometimes taken to cryogenic temperatures to increase the tanker capacity the first commercial ship-to-ship transfer sts transfers were undertaken in february 2007 at the flotta facility in scapa flow 89 with 132,000 m3 of lng being passed between the vessels excalibur and excelsior transfers have also been carried out by exmar shipmanagement the belgian gas tanker owner in the gulf of mexico which involved the transfer of lng from a conventional lng carrier to an lng regasification vessel lngrv prior to this commercial exercise lng had only ever been transferred between ships on a handful of occasions as a necessity following an incidentcitation needed sigtto - the society of international gas tanker and terminal operators is the responsible body for lng operators around the world and seeks to disseminate knowledge regarding the safe transport of lng at sea 90 besides lng vessels lng is also used in some aircraft terminalsedit liquefied natural gas is used to transport natural gas over long distances often by sea in most cases lng terminals are purpose-built ports used exclusively to export or import lng refrigerationedit the insulation as efficient as it is will not keep lng cold enough by itself inevitably heat leakage will warm and vapourise the lng industry practice is to store lng as a boiling cryogen that is the liquid is stored at its boiling point for the pressure at which it is stored atmospheric pressure as the vapour boils off heat for the phase change cools the remaining liquid because the insulation is very efficient only a relatively small amount of boil off is necessary to maintain temperature this phenomenon is also called auto-refrigeration boil off gas from land based lng storage tanks is usually compressed and fed to natural gas pipeline networks some lng carriers use boil off gas for fuel environmental concernsedit natural gas could be considered the most environmentally friendly fossil fuel because it has the lowest co2 emissions per unit of energy and because it is suitable for use in high efficiency combined cycle power stations for an equivalent amount of heat burning natural gas produces about 30 percent less carbon dioxide than burning petroleum and about 45 per cent less than burning coal  91 on a per kilometre transported basis emissions from lng are lower than piped natural gas which is a particular issue in europe where significant amounts of gas are piped several thousand kilometres from russia however emissions from natural gas transported as lng are higher than for natural gas produced locally to the point of combustion as emissions associated with transport are lower for the lattercitation needed however on the west coast of the united states where up to three new lng importation terminals were proposed prior to the us fracking boom environmental groups such as pacific environment ratepayers for affordable clean energy race and rising tide had moved to oppose them 92 they claimed that while natural gas power plants emit approximately half the carbon dioxide of an equivalent coal power plant the natural gas combustion required to produce and transport lng to the plants adds 20 to 40 percent more carbon dioxide than burning natural gas alone 93 a 2015 peer reviewed study evaluated the full end to end life cycle of lng produced in the us and consumed in europe or asia 94 it concluded that global co2 production would be reduced due to the resulting reduction in other fossil fuels burned safety and accidentsedit natural gas is a fuel and a combustible substance to ensure safe and reliable operation particular measures are taken in the design construction and operation of lng facilities in its liquid state lng is not explosive and can not burn for lng to burn it must first vaporize then mix with air in the proper proportions the flammable range is 5 percent to 15 percent and then be ignited in the case of a leak lng vaporizes rapidly turning into a gas methane plus trace gases and mixing with air if this mixture is within the flammable range there is risk of ignition which would create fire and thermal radiation hazards gas venting from vehicles powered by lng may create a flammability hazard if parked indoors for longer than a week additionally due to its low temperature refueling a lng-powered vehicle requires training to avoid the risk of frostbite 95 lng tankers have sailed over 100 million miles without a shipboard death or even a major accident 96 several on-site accidents involving or related to lng are listed below 1944 oct 20 the east ohio natural gas co experienced a failure of an lng tank in cleveland ohio us 97 128 people perished in the explosion and fire the tank did not have a dike retaining wall and it was made during world war ii when metal rationing was very strict the steel of the tank was made with an extremely low amount of nickel which meant the tank was brittle when exposed to the cryogenic nature of lng the tank ruptured spilling lng into the city sewer system the lng vaporized and turned into gas which exploded and burned 1979 oct 6 lusby maryland us at the cove point lng import facility a pump seal failed releasing natural gas vapors not lng which entered and settled in an electrical conduit 97 a worker switched off a circuit breaker which ignited the gas vapors the resulting explosion killed a worker severely injured another and caused heavy damage to the building a safety analysis was not required at the time and none was performed during the planning design or construction of the facility 98 national fire codes were changed as a result of the accident 2004 jan 19 skikda algeria explosion at sonatrach lng liquefaction facility 97 27 killed 56 injured three lng trains destroyed a marine berth was damaged and 2004 production was down 76 percent for the year total loss was us$900 million a steam boiler that was part of an lng liquefaction train exploded triggering a massive hydrocarbon gas explosion the explosion occurred where propane and ethane refrigeration storage were located site distribution of the units caused a domino effect of explosions 99 100 it remains unclear if lng or lng vapour or other hydrocarbon gases forming part of the liquefaction process initiated the explosions one report of the us government team site inspection of the sonatrach skikda lng plant in skikda algeria march 12–16 2004 has cited it was a leak of hydrocarbons from the refrigerant liquefaction process system see alsoedit lng regasification compressed
