resource depletion resource depletion is the consumption of a resource faster than it can be replenished natural resources are commonly divided between renewable resources and non-renewable resources see also mineral resource classification use of either of these forms of resources beyond their rate of replacement is considered to be resource depletion resource depletion is most commonly used in reference to farming fishing mining water usage and consumption of fossil fuels 1  contents 1 causes 2 minerals 3 oil 4 deforestation 4.1 causes 4.2 environmental impact 4.3 controlling deforestation

slash-and-burn agricultural practices currently occurring in many developing countries soil erosion technological and industrial development deforestation mineralsedit minerals are needed to provide food clothing and housing a united states geological survey usgs study found a significant long-term trend over the 20th century for non-renewable resources such as minerals to supply a greater proportion of the raw material inputs to the non-fuel non-food sector of the economy an example is the greater consumption of crushed stone sand and gravel used in construction 2 large-scale exploitation of minerals began in the industrial revolution around 1760 in england and has grown rapidly ever since technological improvements have allowed humans to dig deeper and access lower grades and different types of ore over that time 3 4 5 virtually all basic industrial metals copper iron bauxite etc as well as rare earth minerals face production output limitations from time to time 6 because supply involves large up-front investments and is therefore slow to respond to rapid increases in demand 4 minerals projected by some to enter production decline during the next 20 years gas  2023 7 copper  2024 8 data from the united states geological survey usgs suggest that it is very unlikely that copper production will peak before 2040 5 zinc 9 new developments in hydrometallurgy have transformed non-sulphide zinc deposits largely ignored until now into large low cost reserves 10 11 minerals projected by some to enter production decline during the present century aluminium  2057 8 coal  2060 8 iron  2068 8 such projections may change as new discoveries are made 8 and typically misinterpret available data on mineral resources and mineral reserves 4 5 oiledit peak oil is the period when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached after which the rate of production enters terminal decline it relates to a long-term decline in the available supply of petroleum this combined with increasing demand will significantly increase the worldwide prices of petroleum derived products most significant will be the availability and price of liquid fuel for transportation the united states department of energy in the hirsch report indicates that the peaking of world oil production presents the u s and the world with an unprecedented risk management problem as peaking is approached liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically and without timely mitigation the economic social and political costs will be unprecedented viable mitigation options exist on both the supply and demand sides but to have substantial impact they must be initiated more than a decade in advance of peaking 12 deforestationedit deforestation is the clearing of forests by logging or burning of trees and plants in a forested area as a result of deforestation presently about one half of the forests that once covered earth have been destroyed 13 it occurs for many different reasons and it has several negative implications on the atmosphere and the quality of the land in and surrounding the forest causesedit one of the main causes of deforestation is clearing forests for agricultural reasons as the population of developing areas especially near rainforests increases the need for land for farming becomes more and more important 14 for most people a forest has no value when its resources arent being used so the incentives to deforest these areas outweigh the incentives to preserve the forests for this reason the economic value of the forests is very important for the developing countries 15 environmental impactedit because deforestation is so extensive it has made several significant impacts on the environment including carbon dioxide in the atmosphere changing the water cycle an increase in soil erosion and a decrease in biodiversity deforestation is often cited as a cause of global warming because trees and plants remove carbon dioxide and emit oxygen into the atmosphere the reduction of forests contribute to about 12 of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions 16 one of the most pressing issues that deforestation creates is soil erosion the removal of trees causes higher rates of erosion increasing risks of landslides which is a direct threat to many people living close to deforested areas as forests get destroyed so does the habitat for millions of animals it is estimated that 80 of the worlds known biodiversity lives in the rainforests and the destruction of these rainforests is accelerating extinction at an alarming rate 17 controlling deforestationedit the united nations and the world bank created programs such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation redd which works especially with developing countries to use subsidies or other incentives to encourage citizens to use the forest in a more sustainable way 18 in addition to making sure that emissions from deforestation are kept to a minimum an effort to educate people on sustainability and helping them to focus on the long-term risks is key to the success of these programs 19 the new york declaration on forests and its associated actions promotes reforestation which is being encouraged in many countries in an attempt to repair the damage that deforestation has done 20 wetlandsedit wetlands are areas that are often saturated by enough surface or groundwater to sustain vegetation that is usually adapted to saturated soil conditions such as cattails bulrushes red maples wild rice blackberries cranberries and peat moss because some varieties of wetlands are rich in minerals and nutrients and provide many of the advantages of both land and water environments they contain diverse species and possibly even form a food chain when human activities take away resources many species are affected an ecosystem contains many species years ago people assumed wetlands were useless so it was not a large concern when they were being dug up many people want to use them for developing homes etc on the other side of the argument people believe that the wetlands are a vital source for other life forms and a part of the life cycle wetlands provide services for some loss of wetlands resulted from natural causes such as erosion sedimentation the buildup of soil by the settling of fine particles over a long period of time subsidence the sinking of land because of diminishing underground water supplies and a rise in the sea levelcitation needed see alsoedit holocene extinction
