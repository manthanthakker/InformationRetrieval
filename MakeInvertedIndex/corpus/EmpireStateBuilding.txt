building was first developed as the john thompson farm in the late 18th century 22 at the time a stream ran across the site emptying into sunfish pond located a block away beginning in the late 19th century the block was occupied by the waldorf-astoria hotel 23 frequented by the four hundred the social elite of new york the limestone for the empire state building came from the empire mill in sanders indiana which is an unincorporated town adjacent to bloomington indiana the empire mill land office is near state road 37 and old state road 37 just south of bloomington the bloomington bedford and oolitic area is known locally as the limestone capital of the world 24 25 design and construction the empire state building was designed by william f lamb from the architectural firm shreve lamb and harmon which produced the building drawings in just two weeks using its earlier designs for the reynolds building in winston-salem north carolina and the carew tower in cincinnati ohio designed by the architectural firm w w ahlschlager  associates as a basis 26 27 every year the staff of the empire state building sends a fathers day card to the staff at the reynolds building in winston-salem to pay homage to its role as predecessor to the empire state building 28 the building was designed from the top down 29 the general contractors were the starrett brothers and eken and the project was financed primarily by john j raskob and pierre s du pont the construction company was chaired by alfred e smith a former governor of new york and james farleys general builders supply corporation supplied the building materials 1 john w bowser was project construction superintendent 30 31 32 excavation of the site began on january 22 1930 and construction on the building itself started on march 17st patricks dayper al smiths influence as empire state inc president the project involved 3,400 workers mostly immigrants from europe along with hundreds of mohawk iron workers many from the kahnawake reserve near montreal according to official accounts five workers died during the construction 33 governor smiths grandchildren cut the ribbon on may 1 1931 lewis wickes hines photography of the construction provides not only invaluable documentation of the construction but also a glimpse into common day life of workers in that era 34 the construction was part of an intense competition in new york for the title of worlds tallest building two other projects fighting for the title 40 wall street and the chrysler building were still under construction when work began on the empire state building each held the title for less than a year as the empire state building surpassed them upon its completion on april 11 1931 12 days ahead of schedule just 410days after construction commenced 2 the building was officially opened on may 1 1931 in dramatic fashion when united states president herbert hoover turned on the buildings lights with the push of a button from washington dc ironically the first use of tower lights atop the empire state building the following year was for the purpose of signaling the victory of franklin d roosevelt over hoover in the presidential election of november 1932 35 opening the buildings opening coincided with the great depression in the united states and as a result much of its office space was initially unrented the buildings vacancy was exacerbated by its poor location on 34th street which placed it relatively far from public transportation as grand central terminal and penn station built decades beforehand are several blocks away as is the more recently built port authority bus terminal other more successful skyscrapers such as the chrysler building did not have this problem in its first year of operation the observation deck took in approximately 2million dollars as much money as its owners made in rent that year the lack of renters led new yorkers to deride the building as the empty state building 36 37 the building only became profitable in 1950 the 1951 sale of the empire state building to roger l stevens and his business partners was brokered by the prominent upper manhattan real-estate firm charles f noyes  company for a record $51million at the time that was the highest price paid for a single structure in real-estate history 38 incidents 1945 plane crash at 9:40 am on saturday july 28 1945 a b-25 mitchell bomber piloted in thick fog by lieutenant colonel william franklin smith jr 39 crashed into the north side of the empire state building between the 79th and 80th floors where the offices of the national catholic welfare council were located one engine shot through the side opposite the impact and flew as far as the next block where it landed on the roof of a nearby building starting a fire that destroyed a penthouse the other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft the resulting fire was extinguished in 40minutes fourteen people were killed in the incident 40 41 elevator operator betty lou oliver survived a plunge of 75 stories inside an elevator which still stands as the guinness world record for the longest survived elevator fall recorded 42 despite the damage and loss of life the building was open for business on many floors on the following monday the crash helped spur the passage of the long-pending federal tort claims act of 1946 as well as the insertion of retroactive provisions into the law allowing people to sue the government for the incident 43 a year later another aircraft narrowly missed striking the building 44 suicide attempts over the years more than 30 people have attempted suicide most successfully by jumping from the upper parts of the building 45 the first suicide occurred even before its completion by a worker who had been laid off the fence around the observatory terrace was put up in 1947 after five people tried to jump during a three-week span 46 on december 16 1943 ex-united states navy gunners mate william lloyd rambo 22 jumped to his death from the 86th floor landing amidst christmas shoppers on the street below 47 in the early morning of september 27 1946 shell-shocked 27-year-old marine douglas w brashear jr jumped from the 76th-floor window of the grant advertising agency after phoning a co-worker to tell her i know now this is the end police found his shoes 50 feet from his body 48 on may 1 1947 23-year-old evelyn mchale leapt to her death from the 86th floor observation deck and landed on a limousine parked at the curb photography student robert wiles took a photo of mchales oddly intact corpse a few minutes after her death the police found a suicide note among possessions she left on the observation deck he is much better off without me  i wouldnt make a good wife for anybody the photo ran in the edition of may 12 1947 of life magazine 49 and is often referred to as the most beautiful suicide it was later used by visual artist andy warhol in one of his prints entitled suicide fallen body 50 only one person has jumped from the upper observatory on november 3 1932 frederick eckert of astoria ran past a guard in the enclosed 102nd floor gallery and jumped a gate leading to an outdoor catwalk intended for dirigible passengers he landed and died on the roof of the 86th floor observation promenade 51 two people have survived jumps in both cases by not falling more than a floor on december 2 1979 elvita adams jumped from the 86th floor only to be blown back onto a ledge on the 85th floor by a gust of wind and left with a broken hip 52 53 54 on april 25 2013 a man who is presumed to have jumped fell from the 86th floor observation deck but landed alive on an 85th floor ledge  where security guards brought him inside with minor injuries 55

floor where an outdoor observation deck is located the building has 70mi  113km of pipe 2,500,000ft  760,000m of electrical wire 59 and about 9,000 faucetscitation needed it is heated by low-pressure steam despite its height the building only requires between 2 and 3psi  14 and 21kpa of steam pressure for heating it weighs approximately 370,000 short tons  340,000t the exterior of the building is clad in indiana limestone panels the empire state building cost $40,948,900 to build 4 equivalent to $638,247,300 in 2016 long-term forecasting of the life cycle of the structure was implemented at the design phase to ensure that the buildings future intended uses were not restricted by the requirements of previous generations this is particularly evident in the over-design of the buildings electrical system the buildings art deco design is typical of preworld war ii architecture in new york the modernistic stainless steel canopies of the entrances on 33rd and 34th streets lead to two story-high corridors around the elevator core crossed by stainless steel and glass-enclosed bridges at the second-floor level the elevator core contains 67 elevators 16 the lobby is three stories high and features an aluminum relief of the skyscraper without the antenna which was not added to the spire until 1952 the north corridor contained eight illuminated panels created by roy sparkia and renée nemorov in 1963 in time for the 1964 worlds fair which depicts the building as the eighth wonder of the world alongside the traditional seven these panels were eventually moved near a ticketing line for the observation deck until the 1960s the ceilings in the lobby had a shiny art deco mural inspired by both the sky and the machine age until it was covered with ceiling tiles and fluorescent lighting because the original murals designed by an artist named leif neandross were damaged reproductions were installed over 50 artists and workers used 15,000 square feet of aluminum and 1,300 square feet of 23-carat gold leaf to re-create the mural renovations to the lobby alluded to original plans for the building replacing the clock over the information desk in the fifth avenue lobby with an anemometer as well as installing two chandeliers originally intended to be part of the building when it first opened 60 in 2000 the buildings owners installed a series of paintings by the new york artist kysa johnson in the concourse level in january 2014 the artist filed suit in federal court in new york under the visual artists rights act alleging the negligent destruction of the paintings and damage to her reputation as an artist 61 the buildings lobbies and common areas received a $550 million renovation in 2009 which included new air conditioning waterproofing and renovating the observation deck moving the gift shop to the 80th floor 62 of this $120million was spent in an effort to transform the building into a more energy efficient and eco-friendly structure 20 for example the 6,500 windows were remanufactured onsite into superwindows which block heat but pass light air conditioning operating costs on hot days were reduced and this saved $17 million of the projects capital cost immediately partly funding other retrofitting 63 receiving a gold leadership in energy and environmental design leed rating in september 2011 the empire state building is the tallest leed certified building in the united states 21 features above the 102nd floor on the 102nd floor of the empire state building there is a door with stairs ascending to the 103rd floor 64 this was built as a disembarkation floor for airships tethered to the buildings spire and has a circular balcony outside 65 it is now a hot spot for celebritiescitation needed and an access point to reach the spire for maintenance the room now contains electrical equipment above the 103rd floor there is a set of stairs and a ladder to reach the spire for maintenance work the buildings art deco spire was designed to be a mooring mast and depot for dirigibles 66 an elevator between the 86th and 102nd floors would carry passengers after they checked in on the 86th floor 67 the idea proved impractical and dangerous due to the powerful updrafts caused by the building itself 68 as well as the lack of mooring lines tying the other end of the craft to the ground 69 the buildings design was expanded to include the mooring mast as part of a competition for the worlds tallest buildingcitation needed a large broadcast tower was added atop the spire in the early 1950s to support the transmission antennas of several television and fm stations until then nbc had exclusive rights to the site and  beginning in 1931  built various smaller antennas for their television transmissions 66 broadcast stations new york city is the largest media market in the united states since the september 11 attacks nearly all of the citys commercial broadcast stations both television and fm radio have transmitted from the top of the empire state building although a few fm stations are located at the nearby condé nast building most new york city am stations broadcast from sites across the hudson river in new jersey or from other surrounding areas broadcasting began at the empire state building on december 22 1931 when rca began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the spire they leased the 85th floor and built a laboratory there andin 1934rca was joined by edwin howard armstrong in a cooperative venture to test his fm system from the buildings antenna when armstrong and rca fell out in 1935 and his fm equipment was removed the 85th floor became the home of rcas new york television operations first as experimental station w2xbs channel 1 which eventually became on july 1 1941 commercial station wnbt channel 1 now wnbc-tv channel 4 nbcs fm station weaf-fm now wqht began transmitting from the antenna in 1940 nbc retained exclusive use of the top of the building until 1950 when the fcc ordered the exclusive deal broken based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for the now seven new york-area television stations five licensed to new york city ny one licensed to newark nj and one licensed to secaucus nj to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted construction on a giant tower began other television broadcasters then joined rca at the building on the 83rd 82nd and 81st floors frequently bringing sister fm stations along for the ride multiple transmissions of tv and fm began from the new tower in 1951 in 1965 a separate set of fm antennas was constructed ringing the 103rd floor observation area to act as a master antenna when the world trade center was being constructed it caused serious reception problems for the television stations most of which then moved to the world trade center as soon as it was completed this made it possible to renovate the antenna structure and the transmitter facilities for the benefit of the fm stations remaining there which were soon joined by other fms and uhf tvs moving in from elsewhere in the metropolitan area the destruction of the world trade center necessitated a great deal of shuffling of antennas and transmitter rooms to accommodate the stations moving back uptown as of 2012 the empire state building is home to the following stations television broadcasting wcbs-2 wnbc-4 wnyw-5 wabc-7 wwor-9 secaucus wpix-11 wnet-13 newark wnye-25 wpxn-31 wxtv-41 paterson wnju-47 linden and

by over 110million people the 86th-floor observation deck offers impressive 360-degree views of the city there is a second observation deck on the 102nd floor that is open to the public it was closed in 1999 but reopened in november 2005 it is completely enclosed and much smaller than the first one it may be closed on high-traffic days tourists may pay to visit the observation deck on the 86th floor and an additional amount for the 102nd floor 70 the lines to enter the observation decks according to conciergecom are as legendary as the building itself there are five of them the sidewalk line the lobby elevator line the ticket purchase line the second elevator line and the line to get off the elevator and onto the observation deck 71 for an extra fee tourists can skip to the front of

york sky ride or ny sky ride is a simulated aerial tour over the city the cinematic presentation lasts approximately 25minutes as of may 2013 tickets are adults $57 children $42 seniors $49 since its opening the ride has gone through two incarnations the original version which ran from 1994 until around 2002 featured james doohan star treks scotty as the airplanes pilot who humorously tried to keep the flight under control during a storm with the tour taking an unexpected route through the subway coney island and fao schwartz among other places after the september 11 attacks in 2001 however the ride was closed and an updated version debuted in mid-2002 with actor kevin bacon as the pilot the new version of the narration attempted to make the attraction more educational and included some minor post-9/11 patriotic undertones with retrospective footage of the world trade center the new flight also goes haywire but this segment is much shorter than in the original lights in 1964 floodlights were added to illuminate the top of the building at night 74 since 1976 the spire has been lit in colors chosen to match seasonal and other events such as st patricks day christmas independence day and bastille day after the eightieth birthday and subsequent death of frank sinatra for example the building was bathed in blue light to represent the singers nickname ol blue eyes after the death of actress fay wray king kong in late 2004 the building stood in complete darkness for 15minutes 75 the floodlights bathed the building in red white and blue for several months after the destruction of the world trade center then reverted to the standard schedule 76 on june 4 2002 the empire state building donned purple and gold the royal colors of elizabeth ii in thanks for the united kingdom playing the star spangled banner during the changing of the guard at buckingham palace on september 12 2001 a show of support after the september 11 attacks 77 this would also be shown

the building was lit in blue and white the colors of the israeli flag in honor of the 49th annual celebrate israel parade 79 during 2012 the buildings metal halide lamps and floodlights were replaced with led fixtures increasing the available colors from nine to over 16 million the computer-controlled system allows the building to be illuminated in ways that were unable to be done previously with plastic gels for instance on november 6 2012 cnn used the top of the empire state building as a scoreboard for the 2012 united states presidential election when incumbent president barack obama had reached the 270 electoral votes necessary to win re-election the lights turned blue had republican challenger mitt romney won the building would have been lit red 80 also on november 26 2012 the

building was for the tallest skyscraper to structural height which it held for 42years until it was surpassed by the north tower of the world trade center in 1972 an early-1970s proposal to dismantle the spire and replace it with an additional 11 floors which would have brought the buildings height to 1,494feet  455m and made it once again the worlds tallest at the time was considered but ultimately rejected 86 with the destruction of the world trade center in the september 11 attacks the empire state building again became the tallest building in new york city and the second-tallest building in the americas surpassed only by the willis tower in chicago it is currently the fifth-tallest surpassed by the willis tower the trump international hotel and tower chicago 432 park avenue
