capacity factor the net capacity factor of a power plant is the ratio of its actual output over a period of time to its potential output if it were possible for it to operate at full nameplate capacity continuously over the same period of time to calculate the capacity factor take the total amount of energy the plant produced during a period of time and divide by the amount of energy the plant would have produced at full capacity capacity factors vary greatly depending on the type of fuel that is used and the design of the plant the capacity factor should not be confused with the availability factor capacity credit firm capacity or with efficiency  contents 1 sample calculations 1.1 nuclear power plant 1.2 wind farm 1.3 hydroelectric dam 2 reasons for reduced capacity factor 3

mwh in a 30-day month the number of megawatt-hours that would have been produced had the plant been operating at full capacity can be determined by multiplying the plants maximum capacity by the number of hours in the time period 1,000mw  30days  24hoursday is 720,000mwh the capacity factor is determined by dividing the actual output with the maximum possible output in this case the capacity factor is 0.9  90 1 palo verde nuclear generating station is the largest nuclear plant in the us with a nameplate capacity of 3,942 mw between its three reactors with an annual generation of 31,200,000 mwh in 2010 2 the capacity factor was 90.4 each of palo verdes three reactors is refueled every 18 months with one refueling every spring and fall in 2014 a refueling was completed in a record 28 days 3 wind farmedit the danish wind farm horns rev 2 the worlds largest in 2009 4 comprises 91 siemens swt-2.3-93 wind turbines each of 2.3 mw with a nominal total capacity of 209 mw in 2012 the wind farm generated 956 gwh of electricity 5 the capacity factor for this wind farm was 52.1 onshore wind farms can reach capacity factors of over 60 for example the 44 mw eolo plant in nicaragua had a net generation of 232.132 mwh in 2015 equivalent to a capacity factor of 60.2 6 note that capacity factor is not constrained by the betz limit so capacities higher that 59.2 are possible this is because capacity measures actual production relative to possible production by the turbine as opposed to production vs energy available in the wind hydroelectric damedit large rivers or large reservoirs in wet mountainous areas are ideal water supplies for hydropower in western canada the peace and columbia rivers support capacity factors averaging 85 of a 10,000mw capacity in the mild rainy oceanic climate 7  8 as of 2010 three gorges dam is the largest power generating station in the world by nameplate capacity in 2009 not yet fully complete it had 26 main generator units  700mw and two auxiliary generator units  50mw for a total installed capacity of 18,300mw total generation in 2009 was 79.47twh for a capacity factor of just under 50 hoover dam has a nameplate capacity of 2080 mw 9 and an annual generation averaging 4.2twh 9 the annual generation has varied between a high of 10.348twh in 1984 and a low of 2.648twh in 1956 9 taking the average figure for annual generation gives a capacity factor of reasons for reduced capacity factoredit there are several reasons why a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100 the first reason is that it was out of service or operating at reduced output for part of the time due to equipment failures or routine maintenance this accounts for most of the unused capacity of base load power plants base load plants have the lowest costs per unit of electricity because they are designed for maximum efficiency and are operated continuously at high output geothermal plants nuclear plants coal-fired plants and bioenergy plants that burn solid material are almost always operated as base load plants the second reason that a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100 is that output is curtailed or intentionally left idle because the electricity is not needed or because the price of electricity is too low to make production economical this accounts for most of the unused capacity of peaking power plants peaking plants may operate for only a few hours per year or up to several hours per day their electricity is relatively expensive many other power plants operate only at certain times of the day or times of the year because of variation in loads and electricity prices if a plant is only needed during the day for example even if it operates at full power output from 8 am to 8 pm every day all year long it would only have a 50 capacity factor eg a third reason is that a plant may not have the fuel available to operate all of the time this can apply to fossil generating stations with restricted fuels supplies but most notably applies to intermittent renewable resources when the sun isnt shining solar pv cannot produce electricity when the wind is not blowing wind turbines cannot produce electricity solar pv and wind turbines have a capacity factor limited by the availability of their fuel sunshine and wind respectively a hydroelectricity plant may have a capacity factor lower than 100 due to scarcity of water however its output may also simply be regulated to match the current power need conserving its stored water for later usage a hydroelectricity plant may also be designed for reverse usage so it can pump water up in its reservoir in situations with a power surplus in both cases the use of the hydroelectricity plant to stabilize the grid reduces its capacity factor hydroelectricity may have a higher capacity factor with respect to the turbine size since in some case the amount of stored water fluctuates to account for intermittent availability of water other reasons that a power plant may not have a capacity factor of 100 include restrictions or limitations on air permits and limitations on transmission that force the plant to curtail output load following power plantsedit load following power plants also called intermediate power plants are in between these extremes in terms of capacity factor efficiency and cost per unit of electricity they produce most of their electricity during the day when prices and demand are highest however the demand and price of electricity is far lower during the night and intermediate plants shutdown or reduce their output to low levels overnight capacity factor and renewable energyedit when it comes to several renewable energy sources such as solar power wind power and hydroelectricity there is a fourth reason for unused capacity the plant may be capable of producing electricity but its fuel wind sunlight or water may not be available a hydroelectric plants production may also be affected by requirements to keep the water level from getting too high or low and to provide water for fish downstream however solar wind and hydroelectric plants do have high availability factors so when they have fuel available they are almost always able to produce electricity 10 when hydroelectric plants have water available they are also useful for load following because of their high dispatchability a typical hydroelectric plants operators can bring it from a stopped condition to full power in just a few minutes wind farms are variable due to the natural variability of the wind for a wind farm the capacity factor is mostly determined by the availability of wind transmission line capacity and electricity demand also affect the capacity factor typical capacity factors of current wind farms are between 25 and 45 though current 110 meter towers can have up to 55 capacity factor and future 140 meter towers are expected to have up to 65 capacity factor 11 solar energy is variable because of the daily rotation of the earth seasonal changes and because of cloud cover according to 12 the sacramento municipal utility district observed a 15 capacity factor in 2005 however according to the solarpaces programme of the international energy agency iea solar power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands such as spain or the south-western united states 13 although in some locations solar pv does not reduce the need for generation of network upgrades given that air conditioner peak demand often occurs in the late afternoon or early evening when solar output is reduced 14 15 solarpaces states that by using thermal energy storage systems the operating periods of solar thermal power csp stations can be extended to become dispatchable load following 13 the iea csp technology roadmap  2010 suggests that in the sunniest countries csp can be expected to become a competitive source of bulk power in peak and intermediate loads by 2020 and of base-load power by 2025 to 2030 16 a dispatchable source is more valuable than baseload power 17 geothermal has a higher capacity factor than many other power sources and geothermal resources are available 24 hours a day 7 days a week while the carrier medium for geothermal electricity water must be properly managed the source of geothermal energy the earths heat will be available for the foreseeable future 18 geothermal power can be looked at as a nuclear battery where the heat is produced via the decay of radioactive elements in the core and mantle of the earth real world capacity factorsedit united statesedit according to the us energy information administration eia in 2009 the capacity factors were as follows 19 nuclear–90.3 coal–63.8
