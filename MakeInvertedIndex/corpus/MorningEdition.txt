beginning with its first episode a job he initially took on a temporary basis when a shake-up in production and on-air staff occurred ten days before the shows premiere edwards was joined by barbara hoctor then of weekend all things considered hoctor departed after four months leaving edwards as solo host for the next quarter-century his last day as host was april 30 2004 4 this was not due to edwards retiring but rather a highly controversial decision from npr to reassign him as senior correspondent which resulted in anger and harsh criticism from many listeners 5 6 7 since may 3 2004 the show has been co-hosted by steve inskeep and renée montagne david greene joined as co-host in 2012 8 inskeep reports from npr headquarters in washington dc and montagne reports from the studios of npr

2015 hannity has fallen behind morning edition in the talkers estimate 10 in 1999 morning edition with bob edwards received the george foster peabody award 11 formatedit the following describes the program format effective november 17 2014 12 morning edition begins each hour with a sixty-second billboard highlighting stories to be covered in the hour at least one birthday or anniversary of a major event is announced as well some stations replace this billboard with a localized version with a similar format but with emphasis on local stories and read by a local announcer the standard npr newscast follows for five minutes many stations cut into the newscast at:04 past the hour to deliver additional news programming a sixty-second music bed follows allowing stations additional time to deliver news weather or funding credits after that the signature thirty-second bleeble music bed begins the program the first segment a highlights the most important stories of the day usually the a segments differ between hours although when the topic is extraordinary the a segment will cover the same topic but in a different format between the first and second hour between each segment one- to three-minute breaks occur which are filled with promotions for other programs sponsorship credits and station-provided content such as local traffic and weather reports segment a ends at eighteen minutes past the hour and a sixty-second break follows new to morning edition effective november 17 2014 is a 89-second newscast at:19 and:42 past the hour the mid-hour newscasts emphasize live news including question and answer with correspondents as opposed to headlines following each mid-hour newscast is a 90-second break to allow stations to provide local news and information 13 returning from the break at 22:30 past the hour the second segment or b segment generally contains features commentaries or long form interviews interviews can sometimes take up the entire segment segment b ends at 30:00 past the hour at which point a promotion for all things considered and a humorous news item is delivered these segments are called returns because many stations that air local news or announcements return to the national feed at half past the hour the return lasts thirty seconds and ends with the tagline its morning edition from npr news or some variation thereon 14 at 31:00 past the hour a two-minute music bed is played which most stations cover with news updates or modules from other independent radio producers the c segment follows at 33:35 duration 7:24 and is sometimes covered by stations with local reports as well this segment features news or cultural reports generally running the segment length segment c ends with a mid-hour newscast and station break at 45:35 past the hour the d segment duration 4:00 is typically composed of two to three stories focusing on health news international events or short updates on national stories at 49:35 past the hour the segment ends and another two-minute station break begins the e segment begins at 51:30 duration 7:29 and differs between hours originally in the first hour the e segment was dedicated to stories and features from the world of business while in the second hour segment e included a cultural feature remembrance or softer news story usually taking the entire segment length beginning in november 2014 morning edition moved the second hour e features to the first hour e segment dropping the dedicated business segment to allow npr stations to insert broadcasts of the marketplace morning report which is separately produced and distributed by npr rival american public media prior to this change many stations would already cover one or both e segments with marketplace morning report 15 however some stations continue to air marketplace morning report in place of the e segment for the first hour segment e ends at 59:00 after the hour and leads into a music bed that takes the listener into the next hour or the end of the program depending on the hour and the stations program schedule stations receive over their computers the daily rundown of stories before each program which allows them to plan their coverage and decide what stories they wish to replace with local content the rundown is updated as necessary until the feed ends at noon eastern time differences in pickup timesedit most stations in the central and eastern time zones run morning edition live from 05:00 to 09:00 et repeating one or both hours through morning drive time some stations run only the two hours others run up to seven hours the repeats are automatically fed through the npr satellite and are updated as necessary by npr anchors in the studio when breaking news events occur in the past edwards would stay at his npr office until the program feeds ended at noon in case there was anything that required an update today with two hosts one host generally stays in the studio while the other does field reporting or works on stories for future shows and the transition is seamless unless both hosts have to be away from the studio for some reason in that instance substitute npr anchors john ydstie and linda wertheimer host the re-feeds on the west coast morning edition can run for up to seven hours running from the first live feed with the subsequent re-feeds for example kpcc in pasadena california carries morning edition from 02:00 to 09:00 pst kpcc handles the re-feeds uniquely instead of taking the re-feed from the satellite they roll their own by taking the tape from the feed two hours prior so that they can run the a and b segments of morning edition about three minutes earlier than rival kcrw in santa monica which takes the re-feed direct from the satellite in the event of a breaking news story kpcc runs the same feed as kcrw kjzz in phoenix arizona carries morning edition from 03:00 to 09:00 local time but only uses local announcers news updatesfeatures and trafficweather reports starting with the 05:00 hour satellite radioedit morning edition as well as its afternoon counterpart all things considered is not carried on any of the public radio channels of sirius xm radio the leading us consumer satellite radio provider this is reportedly to reduce direct competition between sirius xm and nprs local member stations almost all of whom heavily use these flagship news programs to generate pledge revenue from listeners 16 tell me more a daytime interview show hosted by journalist michel martin with a focus on african-american issues is featured on npr now channel
