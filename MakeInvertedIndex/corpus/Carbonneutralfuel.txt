tidal wind carbon-neutral fuel electric vehicle fossil fuel phase-out green vehicle plug-in hybrid renewable energy portal environment portal v t e carbon-neutral fuels can refer to a variety of energy fuels or energy systems which have no net greenhouse gas emissions or carbon footprint one class is synthetic fuel including methane gasoline diesel fuel jet fuel or ammonia 1 produced from sustainable or nuclear energy used to hydrogenate waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue exhaust gas or derived from carbonic acid in seawater other types can be produced from renewable energy sources such as wind turbines solar panels and hydroelectric power plants 2 3 4 5 such fuels are potentially carbon-neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases 6 7 until captured carbon is used for plastics feedstock carbon neutral fuel synthesis is the primary means of carbon capture and utilization or recycling 8 to the extent that carbon-neutral fuels displace fossil fuels or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation 9 10 11 such power to gas carbon-neutral and carbon-negative fuels can be produced by the electrolysis of water to make hydrogen used in the sabatier reaction to produce methane which may then be stored to be burned later in power plants as synthetic natural gas transported by pipeline truck or tanker ship or be used in gas to liquids processes such as the fischertropsch process to make traditional fuels for transportation or heating 12 13 14 carbon-neutral fuels are used in germany and iceland for distributed storage of renewable energy minimizing problems of wind and solar intermittency and enabling transmission of wind water and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines such renewable fuels could alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles 12 a 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant has been built in germany and it is being scaled up to 10 megawatts 15  contents 1 production 2 sources of carbon for recycling 3 renewable and nuclear energy costs 4 demonstration projects and commercial development 5 greenhouse gas remediation 6 traditional fuels methanol or ethanol 7 history 8 see also 9 references 10 further reading 11 external links  productionedit carbon-neutral fuels are synthetic hydrocarbons they can be produced in chemical reactions between carbon dioxide which can be captured from power plants or the air and hydrogen which is created by the electrolysis of water using renewable energy the fuel often referred to as electrofuel stores the energy that was used in the production of the hydrogen 16 coal can also be used to produce the hydrogen but that would not be a carbon-neutral source carbon dioxide can be captured and buried making fossil fuels carbon-neutral although not renewable carbon capture from exhaust gas can make carbon-neutral fuels carbon negative other hydrocarbons can be broken down to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide which could then be stored while the hydrogen is used for energy or fuel which would also be carbon-neutral 17 the most energy-efficient fuel to produce is methanolcitation needed which is made from a chemical reaction of a carbon-dioxide molecule with three hydrogen molecules to produce methanol and water the stored energy can be recovered by burning the methanol in a combustion engine releasing carbon dioxide water and heat methane can be produced in a similar reaction more energy can be used to combine methanol or methane into larger hydrocarbon fuel molecules 12 researchers have also suggested using methanol to produce dimethyl ether this fuel could be used as a substitute for diesel fuel due to its ability to self ignite under high pressure and temperature it is already being used in some areas for heating and energy generation it is nontoxic but must be stored under pressure 18 octanecitation needed and ethanolcitation needed can also be produced from carbon dioxide and hydrogen all synthetic hydrocarbons are generally produced at temperatures of 200–300c and at pressures of 20 to 50 bar catalysts are usually used to improve the efficiency of the reaction and create the desired type of hydrocarbon fuel such reactions are exothermic and use about 3mol of hydrogen per mole of carbon dioxide involved they also produce large amounts of water as a byproduct 2 sources of carbon for recyclingedit the most economical source of carbon for recycling into fuel is flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion where it can be obtained for about usd $7.50 per ton 4 7 13 automobile exhaust gas capture has also been seen as economical but would require extensive design changes or retrofitting 19 since carbonic acid in seawater is in chemical equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied 20 21 researchers have estimated that carbon extraction from seawater would cost about $50 per ton 5 carbon capture from ambient air is more costly at between $600 and $1000 per ton and is considered impractical for fuel synthesis or carbon sequestration 7 9 direct air capture is less developed than other methods proposals for this method involve using a caustic chemical to react with carbon dioxide in the air to produce carbonates these can then be broken down and hydrated to release pure co2 gas and regenerate the caustic chemical this process requires more energy than other methods because carbon dioxide is at much lower concentrations in the atmosphere than in other sources 12 researchers have also suggested using biomass as a carbon source for fuel production adding hydrogen to the biomass would reduce its carbon to produce fuel this method has the advantage of using plant matter to cheaply capture carbon dioxide the plants also add some chemical energy to the fuel from biological molecules this may be a more efficient use of biomass than conventional biofuel because it uses most of the carbon and chemical energy from the biomass instead of releasing as much energy and carbon its main disadvantage is as with conventional ethanol production it competes with food production 2 green accounting green economy green trading eco commerce green job environmental enterprise fiscal environmentalism environmental finance renewable energy sustainable

finance feed-in tariff carbon diet food miles 2000-watt society carbon footprint v t e renewable and nuclear energy costsedit nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day therefore the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the us averaged 1.64 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2009 but only 0.71 centskwh during the least expensive six hours of the day 12 typically wholesale electricity costs 2 to 5 centskwh during the day 22 commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce gasoline for less than petroleum fuels when oil costs more than $55 per barrel 23 the us navy estimates that 100 megawatts of electricity can produce 41,000 gallons of jet fuel per day and shipboard production from nuclear power would cost about $6 per gallon while that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010 it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue moreover since the delivery of fuel to a carrier battle group costs about $8 per gallon shipboard production is already much less expensive 24 demonstration projects and commercial developmentedit a 250 kilowatt methane synthesis plant was constructed by the center for solar energy and hydrogen research zsw at baden-württemberg and the fraunhofer society in germany and began operating in 2010 it is being upgraded to 10 megawatts scheduled for completion in autumn 2012 25 26 the george olah carbon dioxide recycling plant operated by carbon recycling international in grindavík iceland has been producing 2 million liters of methanol transportation fuel per year from flue exhaust of the svartsengi power station since 2011 27 it has the capacity to produce 5 million liters per year 28 audi has constructed a carbon-neutral liquefied natural gas lng plant in werlte germany 29 the plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset lng used in their a3 sportback g-tron automobiles and can keep 2,800 metric tons of co2 out of the environment per year at its initial capacity 30 commercial developments are taking place in columbia south carolina 31 camarillo california 32 and darlington england 33 a demonstration project in berkeley california proposes synthesizing both fuels and food oils from recovered flue gases 34 greenhouse gas remediationedit carbon-neutral fuels might lead to greenhouse gas remediation because carbon dioxide gas would be reused to produce fuel instead of being released into the atmosphere capturing the carbon dioxide in flue gas emissions from power plants would eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions although burning the fuel in vehicles would release that carbon because there is no economical way to capture those emissions 12 this approach would reduce net carbon dioxide emission by about 50 if it were used on all fossil fuel power plants most coal and natural gas power plants have been predicted to be economically retrofittable with carbon dioxide scrubbers for carbon capture to recycle flue exhaust or for carbon sequestration 35 7 10 such recycling is expected to not only cost less than the excess economic impacts of climate change if it were not done but also to pay for itself as global fuel demand growth and peak oil shortages increase the price of petroleum and fungible natural gas 9 11 capturing co2 directly from the air or extracting carbonic acid from seawater would also reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment and create a closed cycle of carbon to eliminate new carbon dioxide emissions 2 use of these methods would eliminate the need for fossil fuels entirely assuming that enough renewable energy could be generated to produce the fuel using synthetic hydrocarbons to produce synthetic materials such as plastics could result in permanent sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere 12 traditional fuels methanol or ethanoledit some authorities have recommended producing methanol instead of traditional transportation fuels it is a liquid at normal temperatures and can be toxic if ingested methanol has a higher octane rating than gasoline but a lower energy density and can be mixed with other fuels or used on its own it may also be used in the production of more complex hydrocarbons and polymers direct methanol fuel cells have been developed by caltechs jet propulsion laboratory to convert methanol and oxygen into electricity 18 it is possible to convert methanol into gasoline jet fuel or other hydrocarbons but that requires additional energy and more complex production facilities 12 methanol is slightly more corrosive than traditional fuels requiring automobile modifications on the order of usd $100 each to use it 2 36 in 2016 a method using carbon spikes copper nanoparticles and nitrogen that converts carbon dioxide to ethanol was developed 37 historyedit investigation of carbon-neutral fuels has been ongoing for decades a 1965 report suggested synthesizing methanol from carbon dioxide in air using nuclear power for a mobile fuel depot 38 shipboard production of synthetic fuel using nuclear power was studied in 1977 and 1995 39 40 a 1984 report studied the recovery of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel plants 41 a 1995 report compared converting vehicle fleets for the use of carbon-neutral methanol with the further synthesis of gasoline 36 see alsoedit energy portal renewable energy portal sustainable development portal ecology portal butanol fuel carbon cycle re-balancing carbon sink
