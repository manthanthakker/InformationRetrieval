renewable energy in norway norway is a heavy producer of renewable energy first of all due to good resources in hydropower over 99 of the electricity production in mainland norway is covered by hydropower plants the total production of electricity from hydropower plants amounted to 135.3 twh in 2007 1 there is also a large potential in wind power offshore wind power 2 and wave power as well as production of bio-energy from wood 3 norway has limited resources in solar energy but is one of the worlds largest producers of solar grade silicon and silicon solar cells the system for guarantees of origin was implemented by the eu renewable energy directive 2009/28ec in 2010 the average electricity consumption mix of a norwegian household was 36 renewable 4 as per the european unions 2009 renewables directive later added in the eea agreement norway has established a national goal for renewable energy - 67.5 of gross final consumption of energy supplied by renewable sources by 2020 5  contents 1 wind power 2 transport 3 see also 4 references 5 external links  wind poweredit in 2012 norway had a wind power electricity production of 1.6gwh the following year it approved spending 20billion nok to triple its wind power capacity of ca 700mw to more than 2gw by 2020 6 in august 2016 construction of the 1 gw fosen vind project began transportedit in the transport sector the share of renewables has increased from 1.3 to 4 between 2005-2010 and currently norway has one of the highest numbers of electric cars per capita in the world 7 the governments initial goal of 50,000 electric cars on norwegian roads was reached on 20 april 2015 more than two years earlier than expected by reaching a stock of 50,000 electric cars the market penetration of pure electric vehicles achieved 2 of all passenger cars registered in norway 8 9 the segments penetration passed 3 in december 2015 10 11 with about 90,000 pure electric vehicles registered by mid-september 2016 the all-electric segment achieved a market penetration of 3.5 of all light-duty vehicles on norwegians roads 12 the stock of light-duty plug-in electric vehicles registered in norway passed the 100,000 unit milestone in april 2016 making the country the fourth largest plug-in market in the world after the us china and japan 14 15 as of april 2016update the norwegian fleet of plug-in electric vehicles consist of about 81,500 all-electric passenger and light-duty vehicles almost 17,100 plug-in hybrids and over 2,000 all-electric commercial vans the total stock includes almost 12,000 used imported electric cars 15 in february 2016 the government opened for public discussion until 1 july 2016 the proposed national transport plan 2018-2029 ntp the plan explains that the transportation sector accounts for emissions of about 16.5 million tons of co2 which is about one third of the total greenhouse gas emissions produced domestically in norway and road traffic including both private cars and heavy vehicles account for about 10 million tons of co2 the ntp set policies and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from private cars trucks ships aircraft and construction equipment by about one half until 2030 16 17 in order to achieve this objective among others the ntp sets the goal that all new cars buses and light commercial vehicles in 2025 should be zero emission vehicles this is all-electric and hydrogen vehicles by 2030 heavy-duty vans 75 of new long-distance buses and 50 of new trucks must be zero emission vehicles also by 2030 40 of all ships in short sea shipping should be using biofuels or be low- or zero-emission ships the proposed strategy states that until zero-emission vehicles take over all internal combustion engine cars sold be plug-in hybrids and wherever possible biofuels must be used also government agencies should as far as possible make use of biofuels low- and zero-emission technologies in private and hired vehicles and vessels the plan also calls to support the deployment of zero emission vehicles but also for the reduction of the existing incentives and proposes to invest more in public transport walking and cycling 16 17 18 see alsoedit energy in norway centre for renewable energy electricity sector in norway scotland-norway interconnector renewable energy in sweden renewable energy in finland renewable energy in denmark renewable energy in iceland renewable energy by country referencesedit external linksedit renewable energy in norway -
