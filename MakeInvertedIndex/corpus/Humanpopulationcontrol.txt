human population planning human population planning is the practice of intentionally managing the rate of growth or decline of a human population historically human population planning has been implemented with the goal of increasing the rate of human population growth by reducing death rates in the period from the 1950s to the 1980s concerns about global population growth and its effects on poverty environmental degradation and political stability led to efforts to reduce human population growth rates while population planning can involve measures that improve peoples lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction a few programs most notably the chinese governments one-child policy have resorted to coercive measures  contents 1 methods 2 history 2.1 ancient times

the following practices although there are other methods as well contraception abstinence reducing infant mortality so that parents do not increase their family size to ensure at least some survive to adulthood 1 abortion changing status of women causing departure from traditional sexual division of labour sterilization one-child and two-child policies and other policies restricting or discouraging births directly family planning 2 role-model a small family as the norm 2 the methods chosen can be strongly influenced by the religious and cultural beliefs of community members the failure of other methods of population planning can lead to the use of abortion or infanticide as solutionscitation needed while a specific population planning practice may be legalmandated in one country it may be illegal or restricted in another indicative of the controversy surrounding this topic historyedit ancient times through middle agesedit a number of ancient writers have reflected on the issue of population at about 300 bc the indian political philosopher chanakya c 350-283 bc considered population a source of political economic and military strength though a given region can house too many or too few people he considered the latter possibility to be the greater evil chanakya favored the remarriage of widows which at the time was forbidden in india opposed taxes encouraging emigration and believed in restricting asceticism to the aged 3 in ancient greece plato  427-347 bc and aristotle  384-322 bc discussed the best population size for greek city-states such as sparta and concluded that cities should be small enough for efficient administration and direct citizen participation in public affairs but at the same time needed to be large enough to defend themselves against hostile neighbors in order to maintain a desired population size the philosophers advised that procreation and if necessary immigration should be encouraged if the population size was too small emigration to colonies would be encouraged should the population become too large 4 aristotle concluded that a large increase in population would bring certain poverty on the citizenry and poverty is the cause of sedition and evil to halt rapid population increase aristotle advocated the use of abortion and the exposure of newborns that is infanticide 5 confucius  551-478 bc and other chinese writers cautioned that excessive growth may reduce output per worker repress levels of living for the masses and engender strife confucius also observed that mortality increases when food supply is insufficient that premature marriage makes for high infantile mortality rates that war checks population growth 4 ancient rome especially in the time of augustus  63 bc- ad 14 needed manpower to acquire and administer the vast roman empire a series of laws were instituted to encourage early marriage and frequent childbirth lex julia  18 bc and the lex papia poppaea ad 9 are two well known examples of such laws which among others provided tax breaks and preferential treatment when applying for public office for those that complied with the laws severe limitations were imposed on those who did not for example the surviving spouse of a childless couple could only inherit one-tenth of the deceased fortune while the rest was taken by the state these laws encountered resistance from the population which led to the disregard of their provisions and to their eventual abolition 3 tertullian an early christian author ca ad 160-220 was one of the first to describe famine and war as factors that can prevent overpopulation 3 he wrote the strongest witness is the vast population of the earth to which we are a burden and she scarcely can provide for our needs as our demands grow greater our complaints against natures inadequacy are heard by all the scourges of pestilence famine wars and earthquakes have come to be regarded as a blessing to overcrowded nations since they serve to prune away the luxuriant growth of the human race 6 ibn khaldun a famous north african arab polymath  1332–1406 considered population changes to be connected to economic development linking high birth rates and low death rates to times of economic upswing and low birth rates and high death rates to economic downswing khaldoun concluded that high population density rather than high absolute population numbers were desirable to achieve more efficient division of labour and cheap administration 6 during the middle ages in christian europe population issues were rarely discussed in isolation attitudes were generally pro-natalist in line with the biblical command be ye fruitful and multiply 6 16th and 17th centuriesedit european cities grew more rapidly than before and throughout the 16th century and early 17th century discussions on the advantages and disadvantages of population growth were frequent 7 niccolò machiavelli an italian renaissance political philosopher wrote when every province of the world so teems with inhabitants that they can neither subsist where they are nor remove themselves elsewhere the world will purge itself in one or another of these three ways listing floods plague and famine 8 martin luther concluded god makes children he is also going to feed them 8 jean bodin a french jurist and political philosopher  1530–1596 argued that larger populations meant more production and more exports increasing the wealth of a country 8 giovanni botero an italian priest and diplomat  1540–1617 emphasized that the greatness of a city rests on the multitude of its inhabitants and their power but pointed out that a population cannot increase beyond its food supply if this limit was approached late marriage emigration and war would serve to restore the balance 8 richard hakluyt an english writer  1527–1616 observed that throughe our longe peace and seldome sickness wee are growen more populous than ever heretofore many thousandes of idle persons are within this realme which havinge no way to be sett on worke be either mutinous and seeke alteration in the state or at leaste very burdensome to the commonwealthe hakluyt believed that this led to crime and full jails and in a discourse on western planting  1584 hakluyt advocated for the emigration of the surplus population 7 with the onset of the thirty years war  1618–48 characterized by widespread devastation and deaths brought on by hunger and disease in europe concerns about depopulation returned 9 the population planning movementedit in the 20th century population planning proponents have drawn from the insights of thomas malthus a british clergyman and economist who published an essay on the principle of population in 1798 malthus argued that population when unchecked increases in a geometrical ratio subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio he also outlined the idea of positive checks and preventative checks positive checks such as diseases war disaster famine and genocide are factors that malthus considered to increase the death rate 10 preventative checks were factors that malthus believed to affect the birth rate such as moral restraint abstinence and birth control 10 he predicted that positive checks on exponential population growth would ultimately save humanity from itself and that human misery was an absolute necessary consequence 11 malthus went on to explain why he believed that this misery affected the poor in a disproportionate manner there is a constant effort towards an increase in population which tends to subject the lower classes of society to distress and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their condition the way in which these effects are produced seems to be this we will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants the constant effort towards population increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased the food therefore which before supplied seven millions must now be divided among seven millions and half or eight millions the poor consequently must live much worse and many of them be reduced to severe distress 12 finally malthus advocated for the education of the lower class about the use of moral restraint or voluntary abstinence which he believed would slow the growth rate 13 paul r ehrlich a us biologist and environmentalist published the population bomb in 1968 advocating stringent population planning policies 14 his central argument on population is as follows a cancer is an uncontrolled multiplication of cells the population explosion is an uncontrolled multiplication of people treating only the symptoms of cancer may make the victim more comfortable at first but eventually he dies - often horribly a similar fate awaits a world with a population explosion if only the symptoms are treated we must shift our efforts from treatment of the symptoms to the cutting out of the cancer the operation will demand many apparent brutal and heartless decisions the pain may be intense but the disease is so far advanced that only with radical surgery does the patient have a chance to survive 15 in his concluding chapter ehrlich offered a partial solution to the population problem we need compulsory birth regulation through the addition of temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired family size 15 ehrlichs views came to be accepted by many population planning advocates in the united states and europe in the 1960s and 1970s 16 since ehrlich introduced his idea of the population bomb overpopulation has been blamed for a variety of issues including increasing poverty high unemployment rates environmental degradation famine and genocide 11 in a 2004 interview ehrlich reviewed the predictions in his book and found that while the specific dates within his predictions may have been wrong his predictions about climate change and disease were valid ehrlich continued to advocate for population planning and co-authored the book the population explosion released in 1990 with his wife anne ehrlich however it is controversial as to whether human population stabilization will avert environmental risks 17 18 19 paige whaley eager argues that the shift in perception that occurred in the 1960s must be understood in the context of the demographic changes that took place at the time 20 it was only in the first decade of the 19th century that the worlds population reached one billion the second billion was added in the 1930s and the next billion in the 1960s 90 percent of this net increase occurred in developing countries 20 eager also argues that at the time the united states recognised that these demographic changes could significantly affect global geopolitics large increases occurred in china mexico and nigeria and demographers warned of a population explosion particularly in developing countries from the mid-1950s onwards 21 in the 1980s tension grew between population planning advocates and womens health activists who advanced womens reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach 22 growing opposition to the narrow population planning focus led to a significant change in population planning policies in the early 1990sfurther explanation needed 23 population planning and economicsedit opinions vary among economists about the effects of population change on a nations economic health us scientific research in 2009 concluded that the raising of a child cost about $16,000 yearly $291,570 total for raising the child to its 18th birthday 24 in the us the multiplication of this number with the yearly population growth will yield the overall cost of the population growth costs for other developed countries are usually of similar order of magnitude some economists such as thomas sowell 25 and walter e williams 26 have argued that poverty and famine are caused by bad government and bad economic policies not by overpopulation in his book the ultimate resource economist julian simon argued that higher population density leads to more specialization and technological innovation which in turn leads to a higher standard of living he claimed that human beings are the ultimate resource since we possess productive and inventive minds that help find creative solutions to mans problems thus leaving us better off over the long run 27 he also claimed that our species is better off in just about every measurable material way 28context simon also claimed that when considering a list of countries ranked in order by population density there is no correlation between population density and poverty and starvationcitation needed instead if a list of countries is considered according to corruption within their respective governments there is a significant correlation between government corruption poverty and faminecitation needed views on population planningedit supportedit as early as 1798 thomas malthus argued in his essay on the principle of population for implementation of population planning around the year 1900 sir francis galton said in his publication hereditary improvement the unfit could become enemies to the state if they continue to propagate in 1968 paul ehrlich noted in the population bomb we must cut the cancer of population growth and if this was not done there would be only one other solution namely the death rate solution in which we raise the death rate through war-famine-pestilence etc in the same year another prominent modern advocate for mandatory population planning was garrett hardin who proposed in his landmark 1968 essay tragedy of the commons society must relinquish the freedom to breed through mutual coercion mutually agreed upon later on in 1972 he reaffirmed his support in his new essay exploring new ethics for survival by stating  we are breeding ourselves into oblivion many prominent personalities such as bertrand russell margaret sanger  1939 john d rockefeller frederick osborn  1952 isaac asimov arne næss 29 and jacques cousteau have also advocated for population planning today a number of influential people advocate population planning such as these david attenborough 30 michael e arth 31 jonathon porritt uk sustainable development commissioner 32 sara parkin 33 crispin tickell 34 christian de duve nobel laureate 35 the head of the un millennium project jeffrey sachs is also a strong proponent of decreasing the effects of overpopulation in 2007 jeffrey sachs gave a number of lectures  2007 reith lectures about population planning and overpopulation in his lectures called bursting at the seams he featured an integrated approach that would deal with a number of problems associated with overpopulation and poverty reduction for example when criticized for advocating mosquito nets he argued that child survival was by far one of the most powerful ways to achieve fertility reduction as this would assure poor families that the smaller number of children they had would survive 36 oppositionedit the roman catholic church has opposed abortion sterilization and contraception as a general practice but especially in regard to population planning policiescitation needed pope benedict xvi has stated the extermination of millions of unborn children in the name of the fight against poverty actually constitutes the destruction of the poorest of all human beings 37 population planning is usually associated with eugenics which although most commonly thought of as the desire to eliminate undesirable inheritable traits from the populace negative eugenics it also refers to the encouragement of reproduction between individuals with positively viewed inheritable traits positive eugenics present-day practice by countriesedit chinaedit the most significant population planning system is chinas one-child policy in which with various exceptions having more than one child is discouraged unauthorized births are punished by fines although there have also been allegations of illegal forced abortions and forced sterilization 38 as part of chinas planned birth policy work unit supervisors monitor the fertility of married women and may decide whose turn it is to have a baby 39 the chinese government introduced the policy in 1978 to alleviate the social and environmental problems of china 40 according to government officials the policy has helped prevent 400 million births the success of the policy has been questioned and reduction in fertility has also been attributed to the modernization of china 41 the policy is controversial both within and outside of china because of its manner of implementation and because of concerns about negative economic and social consequences eg female infanticide in oriental cultures the oldest male child has responsibility of caring for the parents in their old age therefore it is common for oriental families to invest most heavily in the oldest male child such as providing college steering them into the most lucrative careers and so on to these families having an oldest male child is paramount so in a one-child policy a daughter has no economic benefit so daughters especially as a first child is often targeted for abortion or infanticide china introduced several government reforms to increase retirement payments to coincide with the one-child policy during that time couples could request permission to have more than one child 42 in november 2014 the chinese government allowed its people to conceive a second child under the supervision of government regulation 43 on october 29 2015 the ruling communist party announced that all one-child policies would be abolished allowing all couples to have two children the change was needed to allow a better balance of male and female children and to grow the young population to ease the problem of paying for the aging population indiaedit only those with two or fewer children are eligible for election to a gram panchayat or local government we two our two hum do hamare do in hindi is a slogan meaning one family two children and is intended to reinforce the message of family planning thereby aiding population planning facilities offered by government to its employees are limited to two children the government offers incentives for families accepted for sterilization moreover india was the first country to take measures for family planning back in 1951citation needed iranedit iran has succeeded in sharply reducing its birth rate from the late 1980s to 2010 mandatory contraceptive courses are required for both males and females before a marriage license can be obtained and the government emphasized the benefits of smaller families and the use of contraception 44 this changed in 2012 when a major policy shift towards increasing birth rates and against population planning was announced in 2014 permanent contraception and advertising of birth control are to be outlawed 45 myanmaredit in myanmar the population planning health care bill requires some parents to space each child three years apart 46 the measure is expected to be used against the persecuted muslim rohingyas minority 47 singaporeedit singapore has undergone two major phases in its population planning first to slow and reverse the baby boom in the post-world war ii era then from the 1980s onwards to encourage couples to have more children as the birth rate had fallen below the replacement-level fertility in addition during the interim period the eugenics policies were adopted 48 the anti-natalist policies flourished in the 1960s and 1970s initiatives advocating small families were launched and developed into the stop at two programme pushing for two-children families and promoting sterilisation in 1984 the government announced the graduate mothers scheme which favoured children of more well-educated mothers 49 the policy was however soon abandoned due to the outcry in the general election of the same year 50 eventually the government became pro-natalist in the late 1980s marked by its have three or more plan in 1987 51 united statesedit enacted in 1970 title x of the public health service act provides access to contraceptive services supplies and information to those in need priority for services is given to people with low incomes the title x family planning program is administered through the office of population affairs under the office of public health and science it is directed by the office of family planning 52 in 2007 congress appropriated roughly $283 million for family planning under title x at least 90 percent of which was used for services in family planning clinics 52 title x is a vital source of funding for family planning clinics throughout the nation 53 which provide reproductive health care the education and services supplied by the title x-funded clinics support young individuals and low-income families the goals of developing healthy families are accomplished by helping individuals and couples decide whether to have children and when the appropriate time to do so would be 53 title x has made the prevention of unintended pregnancies possible 53 it has allowed millions of american women to receive necessary reproductive health care plan their pregnancies and prevent abortions title x is dedicated exclusively to funding family planning and reproductive health care services 52 title x as a percentage of
