low-impact development uk low-impact development lid has been defined as development which through its low negative environmental impact either enhances or does not significantly diminish environmental quality 1 2 3 the interplay between would-be developers and the uk planning authorities since the 1980s has led to a diversity of unique locally adapted developments often making use of natural local and reclaimed materials in delivering highly affordable low or zero carbon housing these lids often strive to be self-sufficient in terms of waste management energy water and other needs 4 there are numerous examples of lids throughout the uk and local and national authorities have come to recognise the need for the concept to be incorporated into planning strategies  contents 1

sense of the term was described by simon fairlie a former editor of the ecologist magazine in 1996 as development that through its low impact either enhances or does not significantly diminish environmental quality 5 fairlie later wrote neither the term nor the concept was new people have been living low impact lifestyles in low impact buildings for centuries indeed until very recently the majority of people in the world lived that way 6 in 2009 fairlie revised his definition of a lid as development which by virtue of its low or benign environmental impact may be allowed in locations where conventional development is not permitted 6 he explained i prefer this revised definition because wrapped up in it is the main argument that low impact buildings need not be bound by the restrictions necessary to protect the countryside from conventional high impact development  aka suburban sprawl there are two other principle arguments in favour of lid i that some form of exception policy is necessary because conventional housing in a countryside protected from sprawl becomes too expensive for the people who work there and ii soon we will all have to live more sustainable low impact lifestyles so pioneers should be encouraged 6 others have expanded on the definition a study by the university of west england acknowledged that lid is usually integrally connected with land management and as much as describing physical development lid also describes a form of livelihood 7 however it also states that as lid is a multi featured and intrinsically integrated form of development a simple definition cannot capture the meaning of lid and goes on to develop a detailed themed definition with detailed criteria 7 dr larch maxey 8 in 2013 held the main features of lid to be locally adapted diverse and unique based on renewable resources of an appropriate scale visually unobtrusive enhances biodiversity increases public access to open space generates little traffic linked to sustainable livelihoods co-ordinated by a management plan examplesedit englandedit english lid examples include the hockerton housing project nottinghamshire michael bucks cob house in oxfordshire 9 landmatters devon 10 and tinkers bubble somerset 11 12 transition homes currently under development in transition town totnes devon is an attempt to scale-up and mainstream lid by providing around 25 low cost low carbon homes designed along permaculture principles 13 14 15 residents will be allocated from the local housing needs register 14 similarly lilac built in 2013 a low impact living affordable community of 20 homes and a common house in bramley leeds 16 17 18 which was visited by kevin mccloud and mark prisk minister of state for housing and local government 19 bedzed london is another example of a larger scale lid which was built in 2000–2002 and has 82 homes however it is not as affordable as many of the above examples as it was partly designed to attract urban professionals scotlandedit findhorn ecovillage has won a number of international awards steve jamess straw house dumfries was built for £4,000 20 walesedit the house of the future cardiff completed in 2000 was originally a showcase of the latest green building technologies and later transformed into an education centre 21 in west wales lammas ecovillage near crymych pembrokeshire is a community of independent off-grid households begun in 2009 22 23 24 nearby pwll broga roundhouse is a development that was built without planning permission in 2012 refused retrospective planning permission in 2014 25 26 but granted permission in july 2015 having met the requirements of the welsh governments one planet development policy 27 that roundhouse brithdir mawr newport pembrokeshire was granted planning permission in 2008 with a review in 3 years benefitsedit substantial research has concluded that lid represents some of the most innovative and sustainable development in the uk 7 28 29 lids have innovated and demonstrated sustainable solutions including lowzero carbon housing design rainwater harvesting renewable energy generation waste minimisation and innovative forms of land management including nolow-till farming permaculture and agroforestry lid has also shown a capacity to enhance local biodiversity and public access to local space and to produce traffic movements far below the national average this has been attributed to lift-sharing to residents greater use of public transport walking and cycling and to the integration of local land based employment with other household activities 30 as the welsh assembly government has noted such development therefore is not just describing a physical development it is describing a way of living differently where there is a symbiotic relationship between people and land making a reduction in environmental impacts possible 31 constraintsedit over the years there have been various struggles with planning authorities over lid in the uk tony wrench spent over a decade fighting the planning authorities until he was granted planning permission for that roundhouse 32 33 34 35 as lisa lewinsohn points out in her msc thesis on lid tony wrench and his partner jane faith have been enforced against fined refused planning permission several times 3 while lammas has probably spent about £50,000 on the application process 3 similarly since 1986 tir penrhos isaf has tried several times to get planning permission 36 and only succeeded in december 2006 twenty years after their first planning application was submitted 37 the residents of tir penrhos isaf consider that current planning and building legislation represent some of the greatest obstacles to developing sustainable systems in britain the legislation favours those who already have land and property actively encourages the squandering of resources and environmental degradation and actively discourages movements towards low impact sustainable development 36 government policyedit the extensive research interest in lid backed up by the practical examples of the existing lids has led to a growing number of planning policies in the uk designed to allow for lids 38 these include the dartmoor national park authoritys emerging plan on low impact dwellings in the countryside 39 the pembrokeshire low impact development policy policy 52 40 and the welsh assembly governments one planet development policy opd 41 2 42 which is supported by the independent one planet council 43 the first development to receive permanent planning permission under the one planet scheme was nant-y-cwm near caerphilly 44 the criteria for opd in wales include the requirement that 65 of all subsistence or 30 of food and 35 of livelihood
