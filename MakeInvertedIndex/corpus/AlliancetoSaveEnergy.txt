efficiency as a cost-effective energy resource under existing market conditions and advocate energy-efficiency policies that minimize costs to society and individual consumers and that lessen greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on the global climate  1 the alliances chief activities include public relations research and lobbying 2 to change us energy policy the creation of the

170 organizations committed to energy efficiency as a primary way to achieve the nations environmental economic energy security and affordable housing goals support of energy independence and security act of 2007edit in 2007 alliance to save energy came out in support of the energy independence and security act of 2007 4 5 6 which phases out the use of inefficient forms of incandescent light bulbs in favor of more energy-efficient lights such as cfl halogen incandescents and led lights the purchase price of more efficient lights is typically higher than the purchase price of legacy incandescents however the low energy consumption and long life span of high-efficiency lights result in lower life-cycle costs than their legacy incandescent counterparts several of the founding member corporations including philips panasonic and sylvania are manufacturers of high-efficiency bulbs however all of these corporations are also manufacturers of the incandescent light bulbs that will be phased out of production following passage of the clean energy bill of 2007 carboncountedit carboncount is a metric developed by the alliance to save energy that quantifies the impact of investments in us-based energy-efficiency and renewable-energy projects given the expected reduction in carbon dioxide co2 emissions resulting from each $1,000 of investment 7 in 2015 bloomberg new energy finance honored carboncount with its finance for resilience fire award 8 fire is an open and action-oriented platform that collects develops and helps implement powerful ideas to accelerate finance for clean energy climate sustainability and green growth fire singles out ideas that have the potential for incremental finance of at least $1bn in clean energy in the first three years of implementation that are achievable within 1-3 years 9 hannon armstrongs 2015 issuance of sustainable yield bonds secured by a portion of its utility scale solar and wind real estate related assets was the first investment to be certified under the carboncount methodology receiving a carboncount score of 0.39 metric tons of co2 offset per $1000 of investment 10 11 in 2016 deutsche bank received a carboncount score of 0.18 metric tons of co2 offset per $1000 of investment in a portfolio of rooftop solar pv systems 12 legislationedit the alliance to save energy supported the bill to require the secretary of energy to prepare a report on the impact of thermal insulation on both energy and water use for potable hot water hr 4801 113th congress which would require the united states secretary of energy to prepare a report on the effects that thermal insulation has on both energy consumption and systems for providing potable water in federal buildings 13 they called the bill a step in the right direction and saying that they are hopeful energy efficiency can once again be an area of common ground between parties 14 they supported the eps service parts act of 2014 hr 5057 113th congress
