freddie mac general motors royal bank of scotland group ubs list of banks acquired or bankrupted during the great recession v t e the financial crisis of 2007–2008 also known as the global financial crisis and the 2008 financial crisis is considered by many economists to have been the worst financial crisis since the great depression of the 1930s 1 2 3 4 the precipitating factor was a high default rate in the subprime home mortgage sector the expansion of this sector had been encouraged by the community reinvestment act cra a us federal law first passed in 1977 and subsequently revised which was designed to help poorer american inner-city dwellers get mortgage loans many of these subprime high risk loans were then bundled and sold finally accruing to quasi-government agencies fannie mae and freddie mac the implicit guarantee by the us federal government created a moral hazard and contributed to a glut of risky lending many of these loans were also bundled together and formed into new financial instruments called mortgage-backed securities which could be sold on as ostensibly low-risk securities because mortgage lenders could pass these mortgages and the associated risks on in this way they could and did adopt loose underwriting criteria encouraged by regulators and some developed aggressive lending practices the accumulation and subsequent default of these mortgages led to the crisis the crisis threatened the collapse of large financial institutions which was prevented by the bailout of banks by national governments but stock markets still dropped worldwide in many areas the housing market also suffered resulting in evictions foreclosures and prolonged unemployment the crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of us dollars and a downturn in economic activity leading to the great recession of 2008–2012 and contributing to the european sovereign-debt crisis 5 6 the active phase of the crisis which manifested as a liquidity crisis can be dated from august 9 2007 when bnp paribas terminated withdrawals from three hedge funds citing a complete evaporation of liquidity 7 the bursting of the us housing bubble which had peaked in 2004 8 caused the values of securities tied to us real estate pricing to plummet damaging financial institutions globally 9 10 the financial crisis was triggered by a complex interplay of policies that encouraged home ownership providing easier access to loans for subprime borrowers overvaluation of bundled subprime mortgages based on the theory that housing prices would continue to escalate questionable trading practices on behalf of both buyers and sellers compensation structures that prioritize short-term deal flow over long-term value creation and a lack of adequate capital holdings from banks and insurance companies to back the financial commitments they were making 11 12 13 14 questions regarding bank solvency declines in credit availability and damaged investor confidence affected global stock markets where securities suffered large losses during 2008 and early 2009 economies worldwide slowed during this period as credit tightened and international trade declined 15 governments and central banks responded with unprecedented fiscal stimulus monetary policy expansion and institutional bailouts 16 in the us congress passed the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 many causes for the financial crisis have been suggested with varying weight assigned by experts 17 the us senates levincoburn report concluded that the crisis was the result of high risk complex financial products undisclosed conflicts of interest the failure of regulators the credit rating agencies and the market itself to rein in the excesses of wall street 18 the financial crisis inquiry commission concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions a combination of excessive borrowing risky investments and lack of transparency by financial institutions ill preparation and inconsistent action by government that added to the uncertainty and panic a systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives especially credit default swaps and the failures of credit rating agencies to correctly price risk 19 the 1999 repeal of the glass-steagall act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the united states 20 critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets 21 research into the causes of the financial crisis has also focused on the role of interest rate spreads 22 in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis palliative monetary and fiscal policies were adopted to lessen the shock to the economy 23 the doddfrank regulatory reforms were enacted in the us to lessen the chance of a recurrence 24 and the basel iii capital and liquidity standards were adopted by countries around the world 25  contents 1 background 1.1 subprime lending 1.2 growth of the housing bubble 1.3 easy credit conditions 1.4 weak and fraudulent underwriting practices 1.5

proceedings 5.5 continuation of the financial crisis in the us housing market  backgroundedit the immediate cause or trigger of the crisis was the bursting of the usa united states of america housing bubble which peaked in 2004 8 already-rising default rates on subprime and adjustable-rate mortgages arm began to increase quickly thereafter as banks began to give out more loans to potential home owners housing prices began to rise easy availability of credit in the us fueled by large inflows of foreign funds after the russian debt crisis and asian financial crisis of the 1997–1998 period led to a housing construction boom and facilitated debt-financed consumer spending lax lending standards and rising real estate prices also contributed to the real estate bubble loans of various types eg mortgage credit card and auto were easy to obtain and consumers assumed an unprecedented debt load 26 27 28 as part of the housing and credit booms the number of financial agreements called mortgage-backed securities mbs and collateralized debt obligations cdo which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices greatly increased 10 such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the us housing market as housing prices declined major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime mbs reported significant losses 29 falling prices also resulted in homes worth less than the mortgage loan providing a financial incentive to enter foreclosureclarification needed the ongoing foreclosure epidemic that began in late 2006 in the us and only reduced to historical levels in early 2014 30 drained significant wealth from consumers losing up to $4.2 trillion 31 in wealth from home equity defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy total losses are estimated in the trillions of us dollars globally 29 while the housing and credit bubbles were building a series of factors caused the financial system to both expand and become increasingly fragile a process called financialization us government policy from the 1970s onward has emphasized deregulation to encourage business which resulted in less oversight of activities and less disclosure of information about new activities undertaken by banks and other evolving financial institutions thus policymakers did not immediately recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and hedge funds also known as the shadow banking system some experts believe these institutions had become as important as commercial depository banks in providing credit to the us economy but they were not subject to the same regulations 33 these institutions as well as certain regulated banks had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or mbs losses 34 these losses affected the ability of financial institutions to lend slowing economic activity concerns regarding the stability of key financial institutions drove central banks to provide funds to encourage lending and restore faith in the commercial paper markets which are integral to funding business operations governments also bailed out key financial institutions and implemented economic stimulus programs assuming significant additional financial commitments the us financial crisis inquiry commission reported its findings in january 2011 it concluded that the crisis was avoidable and was caused by widespread failures in financial regulation including the federal reserves failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk an explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and wall street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels 35 36 subprime lendingedit during a period of tough competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers 10 in the view of some analysts the relatively conservative government-sponsored enterprises gses policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003 however as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined gse power mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated 10 the worst loans were originated in 2004–2007 the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the gses as well as easy credit conditions there is evidence that competitive pressures contributed to an increase in the amount of subprime lending during the years preceding the crisis major us investment banks and gses like fannie mae played an important role in the expansion of lending with gses eventually relaxing their standards to try to catch up with the private banks 37 38 a contrarian view is that fannie mae and freddie mac led the way to relaxed underwriting standards starting in 1995 by advocating the use of easy-to-qualify automated underwriting and appraisal systems by designing the no-downpayment products issued by lenders by the promotion of thousands of small mortgage brokers and by their close relationship to subprime loan aggregators such as countrywide 39 40 depending on how subprime mortgages are defined they remained below 10 of all mortgage originations until 2004 when they spiked to nearly 20 and remained there through the 2005–2006 peak of the united states housing bubble 41 the majority report of the financial crisis inquiry commission written by the six democratic appointees the minority report written by 3 of the 4 republican appointees studies by federal reserve economists and the work of several independent scholars generally contend that government affordable housing policy was not the primary cause of the financial crisis 10 although they concede that governmental policies had some role in causing the crisis they contend that gse loans performed better than loans securitized by private investment banks and performed better than some loans originated by institutions that held loans in their own portfolios 10 in his dissent to the majority report of the financial crisis inquiry commission american enterprise institute fellow peter j wallison 42 stated his belief that the roots of the financial crisis can be traced directly and primarily to affordable housing policies initiated by the us department of housing and urban development hud in the 1990s and to massive risky loan purchases by government-sponsored entities fannie mae and freddie mac later based upon information in the secs december 2011 securities fraud case against 6 ex-executives of fannie and freddie peter wallison and edward pinto estimated that in 2008 fannie and freddie held 13 million substandard loans totaling over $2 trillion 43 in the early and mid-2000s the bush administration called numerous times 44 for investigation into the safety and soundness of the gses and their swelling portfolio of subprime mortgages on september 10 2003 the house financial services committee held a hearing at the urging of the administration to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities 45 the hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of fannie mae and freddie mac as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked ofheo for their attempt at regulation 46 some believe this was an early warning to the systemic risk that the growing market in subprime mortgages posed to the us financial system that went unheeded 47 a 2000 united states department of the treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that $467billion of mortgage lending was made by community reinvestment act cra-covered lenders into low and mid level income lmi borrowers and neighborhoods representing 10 of all us mortgage lending during the period the majority of these were prime loans sub-prime loans made by cra-covered institutions constituted a 3 market share of lmi loans in 1998 48 but in the run-up to the crisis fully 25 of all sub-prime lending occurred at cra-covered institutions and another 25 of sub-prime loans had some connection with cra 49 furthermore most sub-prime loans were not made to the lmi borrowers targeted by the cra especially in the years 2005–2006 leading up to the crisis nor did it find any evidence that lending under the cra rules increased delinquency rates or that the cra indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending to other analysts the delay between cra rule changes in 1995 and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising and does not exonerate the cra they contend that there were two connected causes to the crisis the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the federal reserve after the terrorist attack on september 11 2001 both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place 50 critics also point out that publicly announced cra loan commitments were massive totaling $4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007 51 they also argue that the federal reserves classification of cra loans as prime is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans  3 percentage points over average equal subprime loans 52 others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude in an article in portfolio magazine michael lewis spoke with one trader who noted that there werent enough americans with bad credit taking out bad loans to satisfy investors appetite for the end product essentially investment banks and hedge funds used financial innovation to enable large wagers to be made far beyond the actual value of the underlying mortgage loans using derivatives called credit default swaps collateralized debt obligations and synthetic cdos 53 as of march 2011 the fdic has had to pay out $9 billion to cover losses on bad loans at 165 failed financial institutions 54 the congressional budget office estimated in june 2011 that the bailout to fannie mae and freddie mac exceeds $300 billion calculated by adding the fair value deficits of the entities to the direct bailout funds at the time 55 economist paul krugman argued in january 2010 that the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles and the global nature of the crisis undermines the case made by those who argue that fannie mae freddie mac cra or predatory lending were primary causes of the crisis in other words bubbles in both markets developed even though only the residential market was affected by these potential causes 56 countering krugman peter j wallison wrote it is not true that every bubbleeven a large bubblehas the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates wallison notes that other developed countries had large bubbles during the 1997–2007 period but the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the united states when the 1997–2007 bubble deflated according to wallison the reason the us residential housing bubble as opposed to other types of bubbles led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loans  generally with low or no downpayments 57 krugmans contention that the growth of a commercial real estate bubble indicates that us housing policy was not the cause of the crisis is challenged by additional analysis after researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis xudong an and anthony b sanders reported in december 2010 we find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in cmbs commercial mortgage-backed securities loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis 58 other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place after the crisis in residential real estate business journalist kimberly amadeo reports the first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in 2006 three years later commercial real estate started feeling the effects 59 denice a gierach a real estate attorney and cpa wrote most of the commercial real estate loans were good loans destroyed by a really bad economy in other words the borrowers did not cause the loans to go bad it was the economy 60 growth of the housing bubbleedit between 1998 and 2006 the price of the typical american house increased by 124 62 during the two decades ending in 2001 the national median home price ranged from 2.9 to 3.1 times median household income this ratio rose to 4.0 in 2004 and 4.6 in 2006 63 this housing bubble resulted in many homeowners refinancing their homes at lower interest rates or financing consumer spending by taking out second mortgages secured by the price appreciation in a peabody award winning program npr correspondents argued that a giant pool of money represented by $70trillion in worldwide fixed income investments sought higher yields than those offered by us treasury bonds early in the decade this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007 yet the supply of relatively safe income generating investments had not grown as fast investment banks on wall street answered this demand with products such as the mortgage-backed security and the collateralized debt obligation that were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies 64 in effect wall street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the us with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers and the large investment banks behind them by approximately 2003 the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted and continued strong demand began to drive down lending standards 64 the collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees this essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority those securities first in line received investment-grade ratings from rating agencies securities with lower priority had lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested 65 66 by september 2008 average us housing prices had declined by over 20 from their mid-2006 peak 67 68 as prices declined borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages could not refinance to avoid the higher payments associated with rising interest rates and began to default during 2007 lenders began foreclosure proceedings on nearly 1.3million properties a 79 increase over 2006 69 this increased to 2.3million in 2008 an 81 increase vs 2007 70 by august 2008 9.2 of all us mortgages outstanding were either delinquent or in foreclosure 71 by september 2009 this had risen to 14.4 72 easy credit conditionsedit lower interest rates encouraged borrowing from 2000 to 2003 the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate target from 6.5 to 1.0 73 this was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the dot-com bubble and the september 2001 terrorist attacks as well as to combat a perceived risk of deflation 74 as early as 2002 it was apparent that credit was fueling housing instead of business investment as some economists went so far as to advocate that the fed needs to create a housing bubble to replace the nasdaq bubble 75 moreover empirical studies using data from advanced countries show that excessive credit growth contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis 76 additional downward pressure on interest rates was created by the high and rising us current account deficit which peaked along with the housing bubble in 2006 federal reserve chairman ben bernanke explained how trade deficits required the us to borrow money from abroad in the process bidding up bond prices and lowering interest rates 77 bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004 the us current account deficit increased by $650billion from 1.5 to 5.8 of gdp financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad much of it from countries running trade surpluses these were mainly the emerging economies in asia and oil-exporting nations the balance of payments identity requires that a country such as the us running a current account deficit also have a capital account investment surplus of the same amount hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds capital flowed into the us to finance its imports all of this created demand for various types of financial assets raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates as high as 40 in china or because of high oil prices ben bernanke has referred to this as a saving glut 78 a flood of funds capital or liquidity reached the us financial markets foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing treasury bonds and thus avoided much of the direct effect of the crisis us households on the other hand used funds borrowed from foreigners to finance consumption or to bid up the prices of housing and financial assets financial institutions invested foreign funds in mortgage-backed securities the fed then raised the fed funds rate significantly between july 2004 and july 2006 79 this contributed to an increase in 1-year and 5-year adjustable-rate mortgage arm rates making arm interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners 80 this may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates and it became riskier to speculate in housing 81 82 us housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst 83 84 weak and fraudulent underwriting practicesedit testimony given to the financial crisis inquiry commission by richard m bowen iii on events during his tenure as the business chief underwriter for correspondent lending in the consumer lending group for citigroup where he was responsible for over 220 professional underwriters suggests that by the final years of the us housing bubble  2006–2007 the collapse of mortgage underwriting standards was endemic his testimony stated that by 2006 60 of mortgages purchased by citi from some 1,600 mortgage companies were defective were not underwritten to policy or did not contain all policy-required documents  this despite the fact that each of these 1,600 originators was contractually responsible certified via representations and warrantees that its mortgage originations met citis standards moreover during 2007 defective mortgages from mortgage originators contractually bound to perform underwriting to citis standards increased to over 80 of production 85 in separate testimony to financial crisis inquiry commission officers of clayton holdingsthe largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the united states and europetestified that claytons review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from january 2006 to june 2007 revealed that scarcely 54 of the loans met their originators underwriting standards the analysis conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks including 7 too big to fail banks additionally showed that 28 of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer claytons analysis further showed that 39 of these loans ie those not meeting any issuers minimal underwriting standards were subsequently securitized and sold to investors 86 87 there is strong evidence that the gses  due to their large size and market power  were far more effective at policing underwriting by originators and forcing underwriters to repurchase defective loans by contrast private securitizers have been far less aggressive and less effective in recovering losses from originators on behalf of investors 10 predatory lendingedit predatory lending refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders enticing borrowers to enter into unsafe or unsound secured loans for inappropriate purposes 88 a classic bait-and-switch method was used by countrywide financial advertising low interest rates for home refinancing such loans were written into extensively detailed contracts and swapped for more expensive loan products on the day of closing whereas the advertisement might state that 1 or 1.5 interest would be charged the consumer would be put into an adjustable rate mortgage arm in which the interest charged would be greater than the amount of interest paid this created negative amortization which the credit consumer might not notice until long after the loan transaction had been consummated countrywide sued by california attorney general jerry brown for unfair business practices and false advertising was making high cost mortgages to homeowners with weak credit adjustable rate mortgages arms that allowed homeowners to make interest-only payments 89 when housing prices decreased homeowners in arms then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments since their home equity had disappeared this caused countrywides financial condition to deteriorate ultimately resulting in a decision by the office of thrift supervision to seize the lender former employees from ameriquest which was united states leading wholesale lender 90 described a system in which they were pushed to falsify mortgage documents and then sell the mortgages to wall street banks eager to make fast profits 90 there is growing evidence that such mortgage frauds may be a cause of the crisis 90 deregulationedit a 2012 oecd study 91 suggest that bank regulation based on the basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis in other cases laws were changed or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system key examples include jimmy carters depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act of 1980 didmca phased out a number of restrictions on banks financial practices broadened their lending powers allowed credit unions and savings and loans to offer checkable deposits and raised the deposit insurance limit from $40,000 to $100,000 thereby potentially lessening depositor scrutiny of lenders risk management policies 92 in october 1982 us president ronald reagan signed into law the garnst germain depository institutions act which provided for adjustable-rate mortgage loans began the process of banking deregulation and contributed to the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980searly 1990s 93 in november 1999 us president bill clinton signed into law the grammleachbliley act which repealed provisions of the glass-steagall act that prohibit a bank holding company from owning other financial companies the repeal effectively removed the separation that previously existed between wall street investment banks and depository banks most analysts say that this repeal directly contributed to the severity of the financial crisis of 2007–2010 94 however there is perspective that repeal made little difference because the institutions that were greatly affected did not fall under the jurisdiction of the act itself 95 in 2004 the us securities and exchange commission relaxed the net capital rule which enabled investment banks to substantially increase the level of debt they were taking on fueling the growth in mortgage-backed securities supporting subprime mortgages the sec has conceded that self-regulation of investment banks contributed to the crisis 96 97 financial institutions in the shadow banking system are not subject to the same regulation as depository banks allowing them to assume additional debt obligations relative to their financial cushion or capital base 98 this was the case despite the long-term capital management debacle in 1998 where a highly leveraged shadow institution failed with systemic implications regulators and accounting standard-setters allowed depository banks such as citigroup to move significant amounts of assets and liabilities off-balance sheet into complex legal entities called structured investment vehicles masking the weakness of the capital base of the firm or degree of leverage or risk taken one news agency estimated that the top four us banks will have to return between $500billion and $1trillion to their balance sheets during 2009 99 this increased uncertainty during the crisis regarding the financial position of the major banks 100 off-balance sheet entities were also used by enron as part of the scandal that brought down that company in 2001 101 as early as 1997 federal reserve chairman alan greenspan fought to keep the derivatives market unregulated 102 with the advice of the presidents working group on financial markets 103 the us congress and president bill clinton allowed the self-regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market when they enacted the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 derivatives such as credit default swaps cds can be used to hedge or speculate against particular credit risks without necessarily owning the underlying debt instruments the volume of cds outstanding increased 100-fold from 1998 to 2008 with estimates of the debt covered by cds contracts as of november 2008 ranging from us$33 to $47trillion total over-the-counter otc derivative notional value rose to $683trillion by june 2008 104 warren buffett famously referred to derivatives as financial weapons of mass destruction in early 2003 105 106 increased debt burden or overleveragingedit prior to the crisis financial institutions became highly leveraged increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as off-balance sheet securitization and derivatives which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels 12 these instruments also made it virtually impossible to reorganize financial institutions in bankruptcy and contributed to the need for government bailouts 12 us households and financial institutions became increasingly indebted or overleveraged during the years preceding the crisis 107 this increased their vulnerability to the collapse of the housing bubble and worsened the ensuing economic downturn 108 key statistics include free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from $627billion in 2001 to $1,428billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built a total of nearly $5trillion over the period contributing to economic growth worldwide 109 110 111 us home mortgage debt relative to gdp increased from an average of 46 during the 1990s to 73 during 2008 reaching $10.5trillion 112 usa household debt as a percentage of annual disposable personal income was 127 at the end of 2007 versus 77 in 1990 107 in 1981 us private debt was 123 of gdp by the third quarter of 2008 it was 290 113 from 2004 to 2007 the top five us investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage see diagram which increased their vulnerability to a financial shock changes in capital requirements intended to keep us banks competitive with their european counterparts allowed lower risk weightings for aaa securities the shift from first-loss tranches to aaa tranches was seen by regulators as a risk reduction that compensated the higher leverage 114 these five institutions reported over $4.1trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007 about 30 of usa nominal gdp for 2007 lehman brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated bear stearns and merrill lynch were sold at fire-sale prices and goldman sachs and morgan stanley became commercial banks subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation with the exception of lehman these companies required or received government support 115 lehman reported that it had been in talks with bank of america and barclays for the companys possible sale however both barclays and bank of america ultimately declined to purchase the entire company 116 fannie mae and freddie mac two us government-sponsored enterprises owned or guaranteed nearly $5trillion in mortgage obligations at the time they were placed into conservatorship by the us government in september 2008 117 118 these seven entities were highly leveraged and had $9trillion in debt or guarantee obligations yet they were not subject to the same regulation as depository banks 98 119 behavior that may be optimal for an individual eg saving more during adverse economic conditions can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior as ultimately one persons consumption is another persons income too many consumers attempting to save or pay down debt simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession economist hyman minsky also described a paradox of deleveraging as financial institutions that have too much leverage debt relative to equity cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets 108 during april 2009 us federal reserve vice-chair janet yellen discussed these paradoxes once this massive credit crunch hit it didnt take long before we were in a recession the recession in turn deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell and credit losses of financial institutions surged indeed we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year a process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy consumers are pulling back on purchases especially on durable goods to build their savings businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash and financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm once again minsky understood this dynamic he spoke of the paradox of deleveraging in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firmsand indeed essential to return the economy to a normal statenevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole 108 financial innovation and complexityedit the term financial innovation refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives such as offsetting a particular risk exposure such as the default of a borrower or to assist with obtaining financing examples pertinent to this crisis included the adjustable-rate mortgage the bundling of subprime mortgages into mortgage-backed securities mbs or collateralized debt obligations cdo for sale to investors a type of securitization and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps cds the usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis these products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions cdo issuance grew from an estimated $20 billion in q1 2004 to its peak of over $180 billion by q1 2007 then declined back under $20 billion by q1 2008 further the credit quality of cdos declined from 2000 to 2007 as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5 to 36 of cdo assets 120 as described in the section on subprime lending the cds and portfolio of cds called synthetic cdo enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found for example buying a cds to insure a cdo ended up giving the seller the same risk as if they owned the cdo when those cdos became worthless 121 this boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity it multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage including mortgage brokers specialized originators the securitizers and their due diligence firms managing agents and trading desks and finally investors insurances and providers of repo funding with increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information including fico scores on creditworthiness appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts misjudgments and finally market collapse 122 martin wolf further wrote in june 2009 that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations such as off-balance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks stating an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade  the off-balance-sheet vehicles the derivatives and the shadow banking system itself  was to find a way round regulation 123 incorrect pricing of riskedit the pricing of risk refers to the incremental compensation required by investors for taking on additional risk which may be measured by interest rates or fees several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward readily understandable format 10 12 for a variety of reasons market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as mbs and cdos or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system 21 for example the pricing model for cdos clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system banks estimated that $450bn of cdo were sold between late 2005 to the middle of 2007 among the $102bn of those that had been liquidated jpmorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for high quality cdos was approximately 32cents on the dollar while the recovery rate for mezzanine cdo was approximately five cents for every dollar 124 another example relates to aig which insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps the basic cds transaction involved aig receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party a in the event party b defaulted however aig did not have the financial strength to support its many cds commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in september 2008 us taxpayers provided over $180billion in government support to aig during 2008 and early 2009 through which the money flowed to various counterparties to cds transactions including many large global financial institutions 125 126 the financial crisis inquiry commission fcic made the major government study of the crisis it concluded in january 2011 the limitations of a widely used financial model also were not properly understood 130 131 this formula assumed that the price of cds was correlated with and could predict the correct price of mortgage-backed securities because it was highly tractable it rapidly came to be used by a huge percentage of cdo and cds investors issuers and rating agencies 131 according to one wiredcom article then the model fell apart cracks started appearing early on when financial markets began behaving in ways that users of lis formula hadnt expected the cracks became full-fledged canyons in 2008when ruptures in the financial systems foundation swallowed up trillions of dollars and put the survival of the global banking system in serious peril lis gaussian copula formula will go down in history as instrumental in causing the unfathomable losses that brought the world financial system to its knees 131 as financial assets became more and more complex and harder and harder to value investors were reassured by the fact that both the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators who came to rely on them accepted as valid some complex mathematical models which theoretically showed the risks were much smaller than they actually proved to be 132 george soros commented that the super-boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves similarly the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products it was a shocking abdication of responsibility 133 moreover a conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients combined with a global glut in investment capital led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management there is therefore an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation as the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over-priced under-yielding investments to the detriment of their clients in order to maintain their assets under management this choice was supported by a plausible deniability of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early vintages of subprime loans was so low 134 despite the dominance of the above formula there are documented attempts of the financial industry occurring before the crisis to address the formula limitations specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events 135 the volume credit correlation life after copulas published in 2007 by world scientific summarizes a 2006 conference held by merrill lynch in london where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations see also the article by donnelly and embrechts 136 and the book by brigo pallavicini and torresetti that reports relevant warnings and research on cdos appeared in 2006 137 mortgage risks were underestimated by every institution in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices based on historical trends of the past 50 years limitations of default and prepayment models the heart of pricing models led to overvaluation of mortgage and asset-backed products and their derivatives by originators securitizers broker-dealers rating-agencies insurance underwriters and investors  138 139 boom and collapse of the shadow banking systemedit there is strong evidence that the riskiest worst performing mortgages were funded through the shadow banking system and that competition from the shadow banking system may have pressured more traditional institutions to lower their own underwriting standards and originate riskier loans 10 in a june 2008 speech president and ceo of the new york federal reserve bank timothy geithnerwho in 2009 became secretary of the united states treasuryplaced significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a run on the entities in the parallel banking system also called the shadow banking system these entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system but were not subject to the same regulatory controls further these entities were vulnerable because of maturity mismatch meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term illiquid and risky assets this meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging selling their long-term assets at depressed prices he described the significance of these entities in early 2007 asset-backed commercial paper conduits in structured investment vehicles in auction-rate preferred securities tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes had a combined asset size of roughly $2.2trillion assets financed overnight in triparty repo grew to $2.5trillion assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly $1.8trillion the combined balance sheets of the then five major investment banks totaled $4trillion in comparison the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the united states at that point were just over $6trillion and total assets of the entire banking system were about $10trillion the combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to self-reinforcing asset price and credit cycles 33 paul krugman laureate of the nobel prize in economics described the run on the shadow banking system as the core of what happened to cause the crisis he referred to this lack of controls as malign neglect and argued that regulation should have been imposed on all banking-like activity 98 the securitization markets supported by the shadow banking system started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut-down in the fall of 2008 more than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds 140 according to the brookings institution the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of june 2009 it would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume the authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are likely to vanish forever having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions 141 commodities boomedit rapid increases in a number of commodity prices followed the collapse in the housing bubble the price of oil nearly tripled from $50 to $147 from early 2007 to 2008 before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008 142 experts debate the causes with some attributing it to speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities some to monetary policy 143 and some to the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast-growing world leading to long positions taken on those markets such as chinese increasing presence in africa an increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries as wealth flows to oil-producing states 144 a pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the decade leading up to the price high of 2008 has been recently identified 145 the destabilizing effects of this price variance has been proposed as a contributory factor in the financial crisis copper prices increased at the same time as the oil prices copper traded at about $2,500 per ton from 1990 until 1999 when it fell to about $1,600 the price slump lasted until 2004 which saw a price surge that had copper reaching $7,040 per ton in 2008 146 nickel prices boomed in the late 1990s then the price of nickel declined from around $51,000 £36,700 per metric ton in may 2007 to about $11,550£8,300 per metric ton in january 2009 prices were only just starting to recover as of january 2010 but most of australias nickel mines had gone bankrupt by then 147 as the price for high grade nickel sulphate ore recovered in 2010 so did the australian nickel mining industry 148 coincidentally with these price fluctuations long-only commodity index funds became popular  by one estimate investment increased from $90billion in 2006 to $200billion at the end of 2007 while commodity prices increased 71  which raised concern as to whether these index funds caused the commodity bubble 149 the empirical research has been mixed 149 systemic crisisedit another analysis different from the mainstream explanation is that the financial crisis is merely a symptom of another deeper crisis which is a systemic crisis of capitalism itself 150 ravi batras theory is that growing inequality of financial capitalism produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major political changes he has also suggested that a demand gap related to differing wage and productivity growth explains deficit and debt dynamics important to stock market developments 151 152 john bellamy foster a political economy analyst and editor of the monthly review believes that the decrease in gdp growth rates since the early 1970s is due to increasing market saturation 153 john c bogle wrote during 2005 that a series of unresolved challenges face capitalism that have contributed to past financial crises and have not been sufficiently addressed corporate america went astray largely because the power of managers went virtually unchecked by our gatekeepers for far too long they failed to keep an eye on these geniuses to whom they had entrusted the responsibility of the management of americas great corporations echoing the central thesis of james burnhams 1941 seminal book the managerial revolution bogle cites particular issues including 154 155 that managers capitalism has replaced owners capitalism meaning management runs the firm for its benefit rather than for the shareholders a variation on the principalagent problem the burgeoning executive compensation the management of earnings mainly a focus on share price rather than the creation of genuine value and the failure of gatekeepers including auditors boards of directors wall street analysts and career politicians an analysis conducted by mark roeder a former executive at the swiss-based ubs bank suggested that large-scale momentum or the big mo played a pivotal role in the 2008–09 global financial crisis roeder suggested that recent technological advances such as computer-driven trading programs together with the increasingly interconnected nature of markets has magnified the momentum effect this has made the financial sector inherently unstable 156 robert reich has attributed the current economic downturn to the stagnation of wages in the united states particularly those of the hourly workers who comprise 80 of the workforce his claim is that this stagnation forced the population to borrow in order to meet the cost of living 157 feminist economists ailsa mckay and margunn bjørnholt argue that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession and call for a reshaping of both the economy economic theory and the economics profession they argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics andecological economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet 158 role of economic forecastingedit the former governor of the reserve bank of india raghuram rajan had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the international monetary fundin 2005 at a celebration honouring alan greenspan who was about to retire as chairman of the us federal reserve rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector 159 in that paper has financial development made the world riskier rajan argued that disaster might loom 160 rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but in return offer generous compensation the rest of the time these risks are known as tail risks but perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialise financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimised the financial crisis was not widely predicted by mainstream economists except raghuram rajan who instead spoke of the great moderation a number of heterodox economists predicted the crisis with varying arguments dirk bezemer in his research 161 credits with supporting argument and estimates of timing 12 economists with predicting the crisis dean baker us wynne godley uk fred harrison uk michael hudson us eric janszen us steve keen australia jakob brøchner madsen  jens kjaer sørensen denmark kurt richebächer us nouriel roubini us peter schiff us and robert shiller us examples of other experts who gave indications of a financial crisis have also been given 162 163 164 not surprisingly the austrian economic school regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable credit-fueled bubble that could not forestall the disregarded but inevitable effect of an artificial manufactured laxity in monetary supply 165 a perspective that even former fed chair alan greenspan in congressional testimony confessed himself forced to return to 166 a cover story in businessweek magazine claims that economists mostly failed to predict the worst international economic crisis since the great depression of the 1930s 167 the wharton school of the university of pennsylvanias online business journal examines why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis 168 popular articles published in the mass media have led the general public to believe that the majority of economists have failed in their obligation to predict the financial crisis for example an article in the new york times informs that economist nouriel roubini warned of such crisis as early as september 2006 and the article goes on to state that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions 169 according to the guardian roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession while the new york times labelled him dr doom 170 shiller an expert in housing markets wrote an article a year before the collapse of lehman brothers in which he predicted that a slowing us housing market would cause the housing bubble to burst leading to financial collapse 171 schiff regularly appeared on television in the years before the crisis and warned of the impending real estate collapse 172 within mainstream financial economics most believe that financial crises are simply unpredictable 173 following eugene famas efficient-market hypothesis and the related random-walk hypothesis which state respectively that markets contain all information about possible future movements and that the movements of financial prices are random and unpredictable recent research casts doubt on the accuracy of early warning systems of potential crises which must also predict their timing 174 stock trader and financial risk engineer nassim nicholas taleb author of the 2007 book the black swan spent years warning against the breakdown of the banking system in particular and the economy in general owing to their use of bad risk models and reliance on forecasting and their reliance on bad models and framed the problem as part of robustness and fragility 175 176 he also took action against the establishment view by making a big financial bet on banking stocks and making a fortune from the crisis they didnt listen so i took their money 177 according to david brooks from the new york times taleb not only has an explanation for whats happening he saw it coming 178 impact on financial marketsedit us stock marketedit the us stock market peaked in october 2007 when the dow jones industrial average index exceeded 14,000 points it then entered a pronounced decline which accelerated markedly in october 2008 by march 2009 the dow jones average had reached a trough of around 6,600 four years later it hit an all-time high it is probable but debated that the federal reserves aggressive policy of quantitative easing spurred the partial recovery in the stock market 179 180 181 market strategist phil dow believes distinctions exist between the current market malaise and the great depression he says the dow jones averages fall of more than 50 over a period of 17 months is similar to a 54.7 fall in the great depression followed by a total drop of 89 over the following 16 months its very troubling if you have a mirror image said dow 182 floyd norris the chief financial correspondent of the new york times wrote in a blog entry in march 2009 that the decline has not been a mirror image of the great depression explaining that although the decline amounts were nearly the same at the time the rates of decline had started much faster in 2007 and that the past year had only ranked eighth among the worst recorded years of percentage drops in the dow the past two years ranked third however 183 financial institutionsedit the first notable event signaling a possible financial crisis occurred in the united kingdom on august 9 2007 when bnp paribas citing a complete evaporation of liquidity blocked withdrawals from three hedge funds the significance of this event was not immediately recognized but soon led to a panic as investors and savers attempted to liquidate assets deposited in highly leveraged financial institutions 7 the international monetary fund estimated that large us and european banks lost more than $1trillion on toxic assets and from bad loans from january 2007 to september 2009 these losses are expected to top $2.8trillion from 2007 to 2010 us bank losses were forecast to hit $1trillion and european bank losses will reach $1.6trillion the international monetary fund imf estimated that us banks were about 60 through their losses but british and eurozone banks only 40 184 one of the first victims was northern rock a medium-sized british bank 185 the highly leveraged nature of its business led the bank to request security from the bank of england this in turn led to investor panic and a bank run 186 in mid-september 2007 calls by liberal democrat treasury spokesman vince cable to nationalise the institution were initially ignored in february 2008 however the british government having failed to find a private sector buyer relented and the bank was taken into public hands northern rocks problems proved to be an early indication of the troubles that would soon befall other banks and financial institutions indymacedit the first visible institution to run into trouble in the united states was the southern californiabased indymac a spin-off of countrywide financial before its failure indymac bank was the largest savings and loan association in the los angeles market and the seventh largest mortgage originator in the united states 187 the failure of indymac bank on july 11 2008 was the fourth largest bank failure in united states history up until the crisis precipitated even larger failures 188 and the second largest failure of a regulated thrift 189 indymac banks parent corporation was indymac bancorp until the fdic seized indymac bank 190 indymac bancorp filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in july 2008 190 indymac bank was founded as countrywide mortgage investment in 1985 by david s loeb and angelo mozilo 191 192 as a means of collateralizing countrywide financial loans too big to be sold to freddie mac and fannie mae in 1997 countrywide spun off indymac as an independent company run by mike perry who remained its ceo until the downfall of the bank in july 2008 193 the primary causes of its failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing alt-a loans on a large scale this strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets from its inception as a savings association in 2000 indymac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the united states during 2006 indymac originated over $90 billion of mortgages indymacs aggressive growth strategy use of alt-a and other nontraditional loan products insufficient underwriting credit concentrations in residential real estate in the california and florida marketsstates alongside nevada and arizona where the housing bubble was most pronouncedand heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a federal home loan bank fhlb and from brokered deposits led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007 indymac often made loans without verification of the borrowers income or assets and to borrowers with poor credit histories appraisals obtained by indymac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well as an alt-a lender indymacs business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrowers needs using an extensive array of risky option-adjustable-rate-mortgages option arms subprime loans 80/20 loans and other nontraditional products ultimately loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments the thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the secondary mortgage market indymac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria see the comment by ruthann melbourne chief risk officer to the regulating agencies 194 195 196 may 12 2008 in a small note in the capital section of its what would become its last 10-q released before receivership indymac revealed  but did not admit  that it was no longer a well-capitalized institution and that it was headed for insolvency indymac reported that during april 2008 moodys and standard  poors downgraded the ratings on a significant number of mortgage-backed security mbs bonds including $160 million of those issued by indymac and which the bank retained in its mbs portfolio indymac concluded that these downgrades would have harmed the companys risk-based capital ratio as of june 30 2008 had these lowered ratings been in effect at march 31 2008 indymac concluded that the banks capital ratio would have been 9.27 total risk-based indymac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below well capitalized minimum 10 risk-based capital ratio to adequately capitalized  8–10 risk-based capital ratio the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds senator charles schumer d-ny would later point out that brokered deposits made up more than 37 percent of indymacs total deposits and ask the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic whether it had considered ordering indymac to reduce its reliance on these deposits 197 with $18.9 billion in total deposits reported on march 31 198 senator schumer would have been referring to a little over $7 billion in brokered deposits while the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to indymac at $500 million a month had the regulator disallowed indymac from acquiring new brokered deposits on june 30 indymac was taking new measures to preserve capital such as deferring interest payments on some preferred securities dividends on common shares had already been suspended for the first quarter of 2008 after being cut in half the previous quarter the company still had not secured a significant capital infusion nor found a ready buyer 199 200 indymac reported that the banks risk-based capital was only $47 million above the minimum required for this 10 mark but it did not reveal some of that $47 million capital it claimed it had as of march 31 2008 was fabricated collapseedit when home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed indymac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late june 2008 when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion or about 7.5 of indymacs deposits 201 this run on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from senator charles schumer to the fdic and ots the letter outlined the senators concerns with indymac while the run was a contributing factor in the timing of indymacs demise the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated 194 on june 26 2008 senator charles schumer d-ny a member of the senate banking committee chairman of congress joint economic committee and the third-ranking democrat in the senate 202 released several letters he had sent to regulators which warned that the possible collapse of big mortgage lender indymac bancorp inc poses significant financial risks to its borrowers and depositors and regulators may not be ready to intervene to protect them some worried depositors began to withdraw money 203 on july 7 2008 indymac announced on the company blog that it had failed to raise capital since its may 12 2008 quarterly earnings report had been notified by bank and thrift regulators that indymac bank was no longer deemed well-capitalized indymac announced the closure of both its retail lending and wholesale divisions halted new loan submissions and cut 3,800 jobs 204 on july 11 2008 citing liquidity concerns the fdic put indymac bank into conservatorship a bridge bank indymac federal bank fsb was established to assume control of indymac banks assets its secured liabilities and its insured deposit accounts the fdic announced plans to open indymac federal bank fsb on july 14 2008 until then depositors would have access their insured deposits through atms their existing checks and their existing debit cards telephone and internet account access was restored when the bank reopened 205 206 207 the fdic guarantees the funds of all insured accounts up to us$100,000 and has declared a special advance dividend to the roughly 10,000 depositors with funds in excess of the insured amount guaranteeing 50 of any amounts in excess of $100,000 189 yet even with the pending sale of indymac to imb management holdings an estimated 10,000 uninsured depositors of indymac are still at a loss of over $270 million 208 209 with $32 billion in assets indymac bank was one of the largest bank failures in american history indymac bancorp filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy on july 31 2008 190 initially the companies affected were those directly involved in home construction and mortgage lending such as northern rock and countrywide financial as they could no longer obtain financing through the credit markets over 100 mortgage lenders went bankrupt during 2007 and 2008 concerns that investment bank bear stearns would collapse in march 2008 resulted in its fire-sale to jp morgan chase the financial institution crisis hit its peak in september and october 2008 several major institutions either failed were acquired under duress or were subject to government takeover these included lehman brothers merrill lynch fannie mae freddie mac washington mutual wachovia citigroup and aig 210 on oct 6 2008 three weeks after lehman brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in us history lehmans former ceo found himself before representative henry a waxman the california democrat who chaired the house committee on oversight and government reform fuld said he was a victim of the collapse blaming a crisis of confidence in the markets for dooming his firm 211 credit markets and the shadow banking systemedit in september 2008 the crisis hit its most critical stage there was the equivalent of a bank run on the money market funds which frequently invest in commercial paper issued by corporations to fund their operations and payrolls withdrawal from money markets were $144.5billion during one week versus $7.1billion the week prior this interrupted the ability of corporations to rollover replace their short-term debt the us government responded by extending insurance for money market accounts analogous to bank deposit insurance via a temporary guarantee 212 and with federal reserve programs to purchase commercial paper the ted spread an indicator of perceived credit risk in the general economy spiked up in july 2007 remained volatile for a year then spiked even higher in september 2008 213 reaching a record 4.65 on october 10 2008 in a dramatic meeting on september 18 2008 treasury secretary henry paulson and fed chairman ben bernanke met with key legislators to propose a $700billion emergency bailout bernanke reportedly told them if we dont do this we may not have an economy on monday 214 the emergency economic stabilization act which implemented the troubled asset relief program tarp was signed into law on october 3 2008 215 economist paul krugman and us treasury secretary timothy geithner explain the credit crisis via the implosion of the shadow banking system which had grown to nearly equal the importance of the traditional commercial banking sector as described above without the ability to obtain investor funds in exchange for most types of mortgage-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper investment banks and other entities in the shadow banking system could not provide funds to mortgage firms and other corporations 33 98 this meant that nearly one-third of the us lending mechanism was frozen and continued to be frozen into june 2009 140 according to the brookings institution the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of june 2009 it would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume the authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are likely to vanish forever having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions while traditional banks have raised their lending standards it was the collapse of the shadow banking system that is the primary cause of the reduction in funds available for borrowing 216 wealth effectsedit there is a direct relationship between declines in wealth and declines in consumption and business investment which along with government spending represent the economic engine between june 2007 and november 2008 americans lost an estimated average of more than a quarter of their collective net worthcitation needed by early november 2008 a broad us stock index the sp 500 was down 45 from its 2007 high housing prices had dropped 20 from their 2006 peak with futures markets signaling a 30–35 potential drop total home equity in the united states which

together these losses total a staggering $8.3trillion 210 since peaking in the second quarter of 2007 household wealth is down$14trillion 217 further us homeowners had extracted significant equity in their homes in the years leading up to the crisis which they could no longer do once housing prices collapsed free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from $627billion in 2001 to $1,428billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built a total of nearly $5trillion over the period 109 110 111 us home mortgage debt relative to gdp increased from an average of 46 during the 1990s to 73 during 2008 reaching $10.5trillion 112 to offset this decline in consumption and lending capacity the us government and us federal reserve have committed $13.9trillion of which $6.8trillion has been invested or spent as of june 2009 218 in effect the fed has gone from being the lender of last resort to the lender of only resort for a significant portion of the economy in some cases the fed can now be considered the buyer of last resort in november 2008 economist dean baker observed there is a really good reason for tighter credit tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today businesses are facing the worst downturn since the great depression this matters for credit decisions a homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt they will draw on this equity rather than lose their car andor have a default placed on their credit record on the other hand a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk in the case of businesses their creditworthiness depends on their future profits profit prospects look much worse in november 2008 than they did in november 2007 while many banks are obviously at the brink consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid the problem with the economy is the loss of close to $6trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth 219 at the heart of the portfolios of many of these institutions were investments whose assets had been derived from bundled home mortgages exposure to these mortgage-backed securities or to the credit derivatives used to insure them against failure caused the collapse or takeover of several key firms such as lehman brothers aig merrill lynch and hbos 220 221 222 european contagionedit the crisis rapidly developed and spread into a global economic shock resulting in a number of european bank failures declines in various stock indexes and large reductions in the market value of equities 223 and commodities 224 both mbs and cdo were purchased by corporate and institutional investors globally derivatives such as credit default swaps also increased the linkage between large financial institutions moreover the de-leveraging of financial institutions as assets were sold to pay back obligations that could not be refinanced in frozen credit markets further accelerated the solvency crisis and caused a decrease in international trade world political leaders national ministers of finance and central bank directors coordinated their efforts to reduce fears but the crisis continued 225 at the end of october 2008 a currency crisis developed with investors transferring vast capital resources into stronger currencies such as the yen the dollar and the swiss franc leading many emergent economies to seek aid from the international monetary fund 226 227 effects on the global economy as of 2009edit global effectsedit several commentators have suggested that if the liquidity crisis continues an extended recession or worse could occur 228 the continuing development of the crisis has prompted fears of a global economic collapse although there are now many cautiously optimistic forecasters in addition to some prominent sources who remain negative 229 the financial crisis is likely to yield the biggest banking shakeout since the savings-and-loan meltdown 230 investment bank ubs stated on october 6 that 2008 would see a clear global recession with recovery unlikely for at least two years 231 three days later ubs economists announced that the beginning of the end of the crisis had begun with the world starting to make the necessary actions to fix the crisis capital injection by governments injection made systemically interest rate cuts to help borrowers the united kingdom had started systemic injection and the worlds central banks were now cutting interest rates ubs emphasized the united states needed to implement systemic injection ubs further emphasized that this fixes only the financial crisis but that in economic terms the worst is still to come 232 ubs quantified their expected recession durations on october 16 the eurozones would last two quarters the united states would last three quarters and the united kingdoms would last four quarters 233 the economic crisis in iceland involved all three of the countrys major banks relative to the size of its economy icelands banking collapse is the largest suffered by any country in economic history 234 at the end of october ubs revised its outlook downwards the forthcoming recession would be the worst since the early 1980s recession with negative 2009 growth for the us eurozone uk very limited recovery in 2010 but not as bad as the great depression 235 the brookings institution reported in june 2009 that us consumption accounted for more than a third of the growth in global consumption between 2000 and 2007 the us economy has been spending too much and borrowing too much for years and the rest of the world depended on the us consumer as a source of global demand with a recession in the us and the increased savings rate of us consumers declines in growth elsewhere have been dramatic for the first quarter of 2009 the annualized rate of decline in gdp was 14.4 in germany 15.2 in japan 7.4 in the uk 18 in latvia 236 9.8 in the euro area and 21.5 for mexico 237 some developing countries that had seen strong economic growth saw significant slowdowns for example growth forecasts in cambodia show a fall from more than 10 in 2007 to close to zero in 2009 and kenya may achieve only 3–4 growth in 2009 down from 7 in 2007 according to the research by the overseas development institute reductions in growth can be attributed to falls in trade commodity prices investment and remittances sent from migrant workers which reached a record $251billion in 2007 but have fallen in many countries since 238 this has stark implications and has led to a dramatic rise in the number of households living below the poverty line be it 300,000 in bangladesh or 230,000 in ghana 238 especially states with a fragile political system have to fear that investors from western states withdraw their money because of the crisis bruno wenn of the german deg recommends to provide a sound economic policymaking and good governance to attract new investors 239 the world bank reported in february 2009 that the arab world was far less severely affected by the credit crunch with generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits such as remittances foreign direct investment fdi or foreign aid arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008 this group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks they entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions this gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn the greatest effect of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments significantly lower oil prices could cause a reversal of economic performance as has been the case in past oil shocks initial impact will be seen on public finances and employment for foreign workers 240 us economic effectsedit real gross domestic productedit the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the united statesdecreased at an annual rate of approximately 6 in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 versus activity in the year-ago periods 241 the us unemployment rate increased to 10.1 by october 2009 the highest rate since 1983 and roughly twice the pre-crisis rate the average hours per work week declined to 33 the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in 1964 242 243 with the decline of gross domestic product came the decline in innovation with fewer resources to risk in creative destruction the number of patent applications flat-lined compared to the previous 5 years of exponential increases in patent application this stagnation correlates to the similar drop in gdp during the same time period 244 distribution of wealth in the usedit typical american families did not fare as well nor did those wealthy-but-not wealthiest families just beneath the pyramids top on the other hand half of the poorest families did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis the federal reserve surveyed 4,000 households between 2007 and 2009 and found that the total wealth of 63 percent of all americans declined in that period 77 percent of the richest families had a decrease in total wealth while only 50 percent of those on the bottom of the pyramid suffered a decrease 245 246 247 official economic projectionsedit on november 3 2008 the european commission at brussels predicted for 2009 an extremely weak growth of gdp by 0.1 for the countries of the eurozone france germany italy belgium etc and even negative number for the uk −1.0 ireland and spain on november 6 the imf at washington dc launched numbers predicting a worldwide recession by −0.3 for 2009 averaged over the developed economies on the same day the bank of england and the european central bank respectively reduced their interest rates from 4.5 down to 3 and from 3.75 down to 3.25 as a consequence starting from november 2008 several countries launched large help packages for their economies the us federal reserve open market committee release in june 2009 stated the pace of economic contraction is slowing conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses lower housing wealth and tight credit businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions fiscal and monetary stimulus and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability 248 economic projections from the federal reserve and reserve bank presidents include a return to typical growth levels gdp of 2.5–3 in 2010 an unemployment plateau in 2009 and 2010 around 10 with moderation in 2011 and inflation that remains at typical levels around 1–2 249 government responsesedit emergency and short-term responsesedit the us federal reserve and central banks around the world took steps to expand money supplies to avoid the risk of a deflationary spiral in which lower wages and higher unemployment lead to a self-reinforcing decline in global consumption in addition governments enacted large fiscal stimulus packages by borrowing and spending to offset the reduction in private sector demand caused by the crisis the us federal reserves new and expanded liquidity facilities were intended to enable the central bank to fulfill its traditional lender-of-last-resort role during the crisis while mitigating stigma broadening the set of institutions with access to liquidity and increasing the flexibility with which institutions could tap such liquidity 250 this credit freeze brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse the response of the federal reserve the european central bank the bank of england and other central banks was immediate and dramatic during the last quarter of 2008 these central banks purchased us$2.5trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks this was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market and the largest monetary policy action in world history following a model initiated by the united kingdom bank rescue package 251 252 the governments of european nations and the usa guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems ultimately purchasing $1.5trillion newly issued preferred stock in their major banks 210 in october 2010 nobel laureate joseph stiglitz explained how the us federal reserve was implementing another monetary policy creating currency as a method to combat the liquidity trap 253 by creating $600 billion and insertingclarification needed this directly into banks the federal reserve intended to spur banks to finance more domestic loans and refinance mortgages however banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets banks were also investing in foreign currencies which stiglitz and others point out may lead to currency wars while china redirects its currency holdings away from the united states 254 governments have also bailed out a variety of firms as discussed above incurring large financial obligations to date various us government agencies have committed or spent trillions of dollars in loans asset purchases guarantees and direct spending 255 significant controversy has accompanied the bailout leading to the development of a variety of decision making frameworks to help balance competing policy interests during times of financial crisis 256 the us executed two stimulus packages totaling nearly $1trillion during 2008 and 2009 257 other countries also implemented fiscal stimulus plans beginning in 2008 regulatory proposals and long-term responsesedit united states president barack obama and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in june 2009 the proposals address consumer protection executive pay bank financial cushions or capital requirements expanded regulation of the shadow banking system and derivatives and enhanced authority for the federal reserve to safely wind-down systemically important institutions among others 258 259 260 in january 2010 obama proposed additional regulations limiting the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading the proposals were dubbed the volcker rule in recognition of paul volcker who has publicly argued for the proposed changes 261 262 the us senate passed a reform bill in may 2010 following the house which passed a bill in december 2009 these bills must now be reconciled the new york times provided a comparative summary of the features of the two bills which address to varying extent the principles enumerated by the obama administration 263 for instance the volcker rule against proprietary trading is not part of the legislation though in the senate bill regulators have the discretion but not the obligation to prohibit these trades european regulators introduced basel iii regulations for banks 264 it increased capital ratios limits on leverage narrow definition of capital to exclude subordinated debt limit counter-party risk and new liquidity requirements 265 critics argue that basel iii doesnt address the problem of faulty risk-weightings major banks suffered losses from aaa-rated created by financial engineering which creates apparently risk-free assets out of high risk collateral that required less capital according to basel ii lending to aa-rated sovereigns has a risk-weight of zero thus increasing lending to governments and leading to the next crisis 266 johan norberg argues that regulations basel iii among others have indeed led to excessive lending to risky governments see european sovereign-debt crisis and the ecb pursues even more lending as the solution 267 united states congress responseedit at least two major reports were produced by congress the financial crisis inquiry commission report released january 2011 and a report by the united states senate homeland security permanent subcommittee on investigations entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse released april 2011 on december 11 2009  house

the financial crisis in the us housing marketedit as of 2012 in the united states a large volume of troubled mortgages remained in place it had proved impossible for most homeowners facing foreclosure to refinance or modify their mortgages and foreclosure rates remained high 273 stabilizationedit the us recession that began in december 2007 ended in june 2009 according to the us national bureau of economic research nber 274 and the financial crisis appears to have ended about the same time in april 2009 time magazine declared more quickly than it began the banking crisis is over 275 the united states financial crisis inquiry commission dates the crisis to 2008 276 277 president barack obama declared on january 27 2010 the markets are now stabilized and weve recovered most of the money we spent on the banks 278 the new york times identifies march 2009 as the nadir of the crisis and notes that most stock markets around the world are at least 75 percent higher than they were then financial stocks which led the markets down have also led them up nevertheless the lack of fundamental changes in banking and financial markets worries many market participants including the international monetary fund 279 the distribution of household incomes in the united states has become more unequal during the post-2008 economic recovery a first for the us but in line with the trend over the last ten economic recoveries since 1949 280 281 income inequality in the united states has grown from 2005 to 2012 in more than 2 out of 3 metropolitan areas 282 median household wealth fell 35 in the us from $106,591 to $68,839 between 2005 and 2011 283 media coverageedit the financial crises generated many articles and books outside of the scholarly and financial press including articles and books by author william greider economist michael hudson author and former bond salesman michael lewis kevin phillips and investment broker peter schiff in may 2010 a documentary overdose a film about the next financial crisis 284 premiered about how the financial crisis came about and how the solutions that have been applied by many governments are setting the stage for the next crisis the film is based on the book financial fiasco by johan norberg and features alan greenspan with funding from the libertarian think tank the cato institute greenspan is responsible for de-regulating the derivatives market while chairman of the federal reserve in october 2010 a documentary film about the crisis inside job directed by charles ferguson was released by sony pictures classics in 2011 it was awarded the academy award for best documentary feature at the 83rd academy awards time magazine named "25 people to blame for the financial crisis 285 michael lewis published a best-selling non-fiction book about the crisis entitled the big short in 2015 it was adapted into a film of the same name which won the academy award for best adapted screenplay one point raised is to what extent those outside of the markets themselves ie not working for a mainstream investment bank could forecast the events and be generally less myopic subsequent to the crisis itself some observers furthermore noted a change in social relations as some group culpability emerged 286 emerging and developing economies drive global economic growthedit advanced economies led global economic growth prior to the financial crisis with emerging and developing economies lagging behind the crisis completely overturned this relationship the international monetary fund found that advanced economies accounted for only 31 of global gdp while emerging and developing economies accounted for 69 of global gdp from 2007 to 2014 287 in the tables the names of emergent economies are shown in
