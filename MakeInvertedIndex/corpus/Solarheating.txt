sunlight a collector is a device for capturing solar radiation solar radiation is energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation from the infrared long to the ultraviolet short wavelengths the quantity of solar energy striking the earths surface solar constant averages about 1,000 watts per square meter under clear skies depending upon weather conditions location and orientation the term solar collector commonly refers to solar hot water panels but may refer to installations such as solar parabolic troughs and solar towers or basic installations such as solar air heaters concentrated solar power plants usually use the more complex collectors to generate electricity by heating a fluid to drive a turbine connected to an electrical generator 1 simple collectors are typically used in

6.1 parabolic trough 6.2 parabolic dish 6.3 power tower solar-thermal collectors heating liquidedit solar collectors are either non-concentrating or concentrating in the non-concentrating type the collector area ie the area that intercepts the solar radiation is the same as the absorber area ie the area absorbing the radiation in these types the whole solar panel absorbs light concentrating collectors have a bigger interceptor than absorber 1 flat-plate and evacuated-tube solar collectors are used to collect heat for space heating domestic hot water or cooling with an absorption chiller flat plate collectorsedit flat-plate collectors developed by hottel and whillier in the 1950s are the most common type they consist of  1 a dark flat-plate absorber  2 a transparent cover that reduces heat losses  3 a heat-transport fluid air antifreeze or water to remove heat from the absorber and  4 a heat insulating backing the absorber consists of a thin absorber sheet of thermally stable polymers aluminum steel or copper to which a matte black or selective coating is applied often backed by a grid or coil of fluid tubing placed in an insulated casing with a glass or polycarbonate cover in water heat panels fluid is usually circulated through tubing to transfer heat from the absorber to an insulated water tank this may be achieved directly or through a heat exchanger most air heat fabricators and some water heat manufacturers have a completely flooded absorber consisting of two sheets of metal which the fluid passes between because the heat exchange area is greater they may be marginally more efficient than traditional absorbers 3 sunlight passes through the glazing and strikes the absorber plate which heats up changing solar energy into heat energy the heat is transferred to liquid passing through pipes attached to the absorber plate absorber plates are commonly painted with selective coatings which absorb and retain heat better than ordinary black paint absorber plates are usually made of metaltypically copper or aluminumbecause the metal is a good heat conductor copper is more expensive but is a better conductor and less prone to corrosion than aluminum see copper in solar water heaters in locations with average available solar energy flat plate collectors are sized approximately one-half to one square foot per gallon of one days hot water use absorber piping configurations include harp traditional design with bottom pipe risers and top collection pipe used in low pressure thermosyphon and pumped systems serpentine one continuous s that maximizes temperature but not total energy yield in variable flow systems used in compact solar domestic hot water only systems no space heating role flooded absorber consisting of two sheets of metal stamped to produce a circulation zone boundary layer absorber collectors consisting of several layers of transparent and opaque sheets that enable absorption in a boundary layer because the energy is absorbed in the boundary layer heat conversion may be more efficient than for collectors where absorbed heat is conducted through a material before the heat is accumulated in a circulating liquidcitation needed polymer flat plate collectors are an alternative to metal collectors and are now being produced in europe these may be wholly polymer or they may include metal plates in front of freeze-tolerant water channels made of silicone rubber polymers are flexible and therefore freeze-tolerant and can employ plain water instead of antifreeze so that they may be plumbed directly into existing water tanks instead of needing heat exchangers that lower efficiency by dispensing with a heat exchanger temperatures need not be quite so high for the circulation system to be switched on so such direct circulation panels whether polymer or otherwise can be more efficient particularly at low light levels some early selectively coated polymer collectors suffered from overheating when insulated as stagnation temperatures can exceed the polymers melting point 4 5 for example the melting point of polypropylene is 160c  320f while the stagnation temperature of insulated thermal collectors can exceed 180c  356f if control strategies are not used for this reason polypropylene is not often used in glazed selectively coated solar collectors increasingly polymers such as high temperate silicones which melt at over 250c  482f are being used some non polypropylene polymer based glazed solar collectors are matte black coated rather than selectively coated to reduce the stagnation temperature to 150c  302f or less in areas where freezing is a possibility freeze-tolerance the capability to freeze repeatedly without cracking can be achieved by the use of flexible polymers silicone rubber pipes have been used for this purpose in uk since 1999 conventional metal collectors are vulnerable to damage from freezing so if they are water filled they must be carefully plumbed so they completely drain using gravity before freezing is expected so that they do not crack many metal collectors are installed as part of a sealed heat exchanger system rather than having potable water flow directly through the collectors a mixture of water and antifreeze such as propylene glycol is used a heat exchange fluid protects against freeze damage down to a locally determined risk temperature that depends on the proportion of propylene glycol in the mixture the use of glycol lowers the waters heat carrying capacity marginally while the addition of an extra heat exchanger may lower system performance at low light levels a pool or unglazed collector is a simple form of flat-plate collector without a transparent cover typically polypropylene or epdm rubber or silicone rubber is used as an absorber used for pool heating it can work quite well when the desired output temperature is near the ambient temperature that is when it is warm outside as the ambient temperature gets cooler these collectors become less effective most flat plate collectors have a life expectancy of over 25 years applicationsedit the main use of this technology is in residential buildings where the demand for hot water has a large impact on energy bills this generally means a situation with a large family or a situation in which the hot water demand is excessive due to frequent laundry washing commercial applications include laundromats car washes military laundry facilities and eating establishments the technology can also be used for space heating if the building is located off-grid or if utility power is subject to frequent outages solar water heating systems are most likely to be cost effective for facilities with water heating systems that are expensive to operate or with operations such as laundries or kitchens that require large quantities of hot water unglazed liquid collectors are commonly used to heat water for swimming pools but can also be applied to large scale water pre-heating when loads are large relative to available collector area the bulk of the water heating can be done at low temperature lower than at swimming pool temperatures where unglazed collectors are well established in the marketplace as the right choice because these collectors need not withstand high temperatures they can use less expensive materials such as plastic or rubber many unglazed collectors are made of polypropylene and must be drained fully to avoid freeze damage when air temperatures drop below 44f on clear nights 6 a smaller but growing percentage of unglazed collectors are flexible meaning they can withstand water freezing solid inside their absorber the freeze concern only need be the water filled piping and collector manifolds in a hard freeze condition unglazed solar hot water systems should be installed to drainback to a storage tank whenever solar radiation is insufficient there are no thermal shock concerns with unglazed systems commonly used in swimming pool heating since solar energys early beginnings unglazed solar collectors heat swimming pool water directly without the need for antifreeze or heat exchangers hot water solar systems require heat exchangers due to contamination possibilities and in the case of unglazed collectors the pressure difference between the solar working fluid water and the load pressurized cold city water large scale unglazed solar hot water heaters like the one at the minoru aquatic center in richmond bc 7 operate at lower temperatures than evacuated tube or boxed and glazed collector systems so they require larger more expensive heat exchangers but all other components including vented storage tanks and uninsulated plastic pvc piping reduce costs of this alternative dramatically compared to the higher temperature collector types when heating hot water we are actually heating cold to warm and warm to hot we can heat cold to warm as efficiently with unglazed collectors as we can heat warm to hot with high temperature collectors evacuated tube collectorsedit most vacuum tube collectors in use in middle europe use heat pipes for their core instead of passing liquid directly through them direct flow is more popular in china evacuated heat pipe tubes ehpts are composed of multiple evacuated glass tubes each containing an absorber plate fused to a heat pipe 8 the heat is transferred to the transfer fluid water or an antifreeze mixtypically propylene glycol of a domestic hot water or hydronic space heating system in a heat exchanger called a manifold the manifold is wrapped in insulation and covered by a protective sheet metal or plastic case the vacuum inside of the evacuated tube collectors have been proven to last more than 25 years the reflective coating for the design is encapsulated in the vacuum inside of the tube which will not degrade until the vacuum is lost 9 the vacuum that surrounds the outside of the tube greatly reduces convection and conduction heat loss therefore achieving greater efficiency than flat-plate collectors especially in colder conditions this advantage is largely lost in warmer climates except in those cases where very hot water is desirable eg for commercial processes the high temperatures that can occur may require special design to prevent overheating some evacuated tubes glass-metal are made with one layer of glass that fuses to the heat pipe at the upper end and encloses the heat pipe and absorber in the vacuum others glass-glass are made with a double layer of glass fused together at one or both ends with a vacuum between the layers like a vacuum bottle or flask with the absorber and heat pipe contained at normal atmospheric pressure glass-glass tubes have a highly reliable vacuum seal but the two layers of glass reduce the light that reaches the absorber moisture may enter the non-evacuated area of the tube and cause absorber corrosion glass-metal tubes allow more light to reach the absorber and protect the absorber and heat pipe from corrosion even if they are made from dissimilar materials see galvanic corrosion the gaps between the tubes may allow for snow to fall through the collector minimizing the loss of production in some snowy conditions though the lack of radiated heat from the tubes can also prevent effective shedding of accumulated snow 10 11 comparisons of flat plate and evacuated tube collectorsedit a longstanding argument exists between proponents of these two technologies some of this can be related to the physical structure of evacuated tube collectors which have a discontinuous absorbance area an array of evacuated tubes on a roof has open space between the collector tubes and vacuum between the two concentric glass tubes of each collector collector tubes cover only a fraction of a unit area of a roof if evacuated tubes are compared with flat-plate collectors on the basis of area of roof occupied a different conclusion might be reached than if the areas of absorber were compared in addition the iso 9806 standard 12 is ambiguous in describing the way in which the efficiency of solar thermal collectors should be measured since these could be measured either in terms of gross area or in terms of absorber area unfortunately power output is not given for thermal collectors as it is for pv panels this makes it difficult for purchasers and engineers to make informed decisions flat-plate collectors usually lose more heat to the environment than evacuated tubes as an increasing function of temperature they are inappropriate for high temperature applications such as process steam production evacuated tube collectors have a lower absorber plate area to gross area ratio typically 60–80 of gross area compared to flat plates based on absorber plate area most evacuated tube systems are more efficient per square meter than equivalent flat plate systems this makes them suitable where roof space is limiting for example where the number of occupants of a building is higher than the number of square metres of suitable and available roof space in general per installed square metre evacuated tubes deliver marginally more energy when the ambient temperature is low eg during winter or when the sky is overcast however even in areas without much sunshine and solar heat some low cost flat plate collectors can be more cost efficient than evacuated tube collectors although several european companies manufacture evacuated tube collectors the evacuated tube market is dominated by manufacturers in the east several chinese companies have track records of 15–30 years there is no unambiguous evidence that the two designs differ in long term reliability however evacuated tube technology is younger and especially for newer variants with sealed heat pipes still need to demonstrate competitive lifetimes the modularity of evacuated tubes can be advantageous in terms of extensibility and maintenance for example if the vacuum in one tube diminishes for a given absorber area evacuated tubes can therefore maintain their efficiency over a wide range of ambient temperatures and heating requirements in most climates flat-plate collectors will generally be more cost-effective than evacuated tubes when employed in arrays and considered instead on a per square metre basis the efficient but costly evacuated tube collectors can have a net benefit in winter and summer they are well-suited to cold ambient temperatures and work well in situations of consistently low sunshine providing heat more consistently than flat plate collectors per square metre heating of water by a medium to low amount ie tm-ta is much more efficiently performed by flat plate collectors domestic hot water frequently falls into this medium category glazed or unglazed flat collectors are the preferred devices for heating swimming pool water 15 unglazed collectors may be suitable in tropical or subtropical environments if domestic hot water needs to be heated by less than 20c a contour map can show which type is more effective both thermal efficiency and energycost for any geographic region ehpts work as a thermal one-way valve due to their heat pipes this gives them an inherent maximum operating temperature that acts as a safety feature they have less aerodynamic drag which may allow them to be placed onto the roof without being tied down they can collect thermal radiation from the bottom in addition to the top tubes can be replaced individually without stopping the entire system there is no condensation or corrosion within the tubes one hurdle to wider adoption of evacuated tube collectors in some markets is their inability to pass internal thermal shock tests where iso 9806-2 section 9 class b is a requirement for durability certification 16 this means that if unprotected evacuated tube collectors are exposed to full sun for too long prior to being filled with cold water the tubes may shatter due to the rapid temperature shift there is also the question of vacuum leakage flat panels have been around much longer and are less expensive they may be easier to clean other properties such as appearance and ease of installation are more subjective bowledit a solar bowl is a type of solar thermal collector that operates similarly to a parabolic dish but instead of using a tracking parabolic mirror with a fixed receiver it has a fixed spherical mirror with a tracking receiver this reduces efficiency but makes it cheaper to build and operate designers call it a fixed mirror distributed focus solar power system the main reason for its development was to eliminate the cost of moving a large mirror to track the sun as with parabolic dish systems 17 a fixed parabolic mirror creates a variously shaped image of the sun as it moves across the sky only when the mirror is pointed directly at the sun does the light focus on one point that is why parabolic dish systems track the sun a fixed spherical mirror focuses the light in the same place independent of the suns position the light however is not directed to one point but is distributed on a line from the surface of the mirror to one half radius along a line that runs through the sphere center and the sun as the sun moves across the sky the aperture of any fixed collector changes this causes changes in the amount of captured sunlight producing what is called the sinus effect of power output proponents of the solar bowl design claim the reduction in overall power output compared with tracking parabolic mirrors is offset by lower system costs 17 the sunlight concentrated at the focal line of a spherical reflector is collected using a tracking receiver this receiver is pivoted around the focal line and is usually counterbalanced the receiver may consist of pipes carrying fluid for thermal transfer or photovoltaic cells for direct conversion of light to electricity the solar bowl design resulted from a project of the electrical engineering department of the texas technical university headed by edwin ohair to develop a 5 mwe power plant a solar bowl was built for the town of crosbyton texas as a pilot facility 17 the bowl had a diameter of 65ft  20m tilted at a 15 angle to optimize the costyield relation  33 would have maximized yield the rim of the hemisphere was trimmed to 60 creating a maximum aperture of 3,318 square feet  308.3m2 this pilot bowl produced electricity at a rate of 10kw peakcitation needed a 15-meter diameter auroville solar bowl was developed from an earlier test of a 3.5-meter bowl in 1979–1982 by the tata energy research institute that test showed the use of the solar bowl in the production of steam for cooking the full-scale project to build a solar bowl and kitchen ran from 1996 and was fully operational by 2001citation needed solar-thermal collectors heating airedit a simple solar air collector consists of an absorber material sometimes having a selective surface to capture radiation from the sun and transfers this thermal energy to air via conduction heat transfer this heated air is then ducted to the building space or to the process area where the heated air is used for space heating or process heating needs functioning in a similar manner as a conventional forced air furnace solar-thermal-air systems provide heat by circulating air over an energy collecting surface absorbing the suns thermal energy and ducting air coming in contact with it simple and effective collectors can be made for a variety of air conditioning and process applications a variety of applications can utilize solar air heat technologies to reduce the carbon footprint from use of conventional heat sources such as fossil fuels to create a sustainable means to produce thermal energy applications such as space heating greenhouse season extension pre-heating ventilation makeup air or process heat can be addressed by solar air heat devices in the field of solar co-generation solar thermal technologies are paired with photovoltaics pv to increase the efficiency of the system by taking heat away from the pv collectors cooling the pv panels to improve their electrical performance while simultaneously warming air for space heating space heating and ventilatingedit space heating for residential and commercial applications can be done through the use of solar air heating panels this configuration operates by drawing air from the building envelope or from the outdoor environment and passing it through the collector where the air warms via conduction from the absorber and is then supplied to the living or working space by either passive means or with the assistance of a fan a pioneering figure of this type of system was george löf who built solar heated air system for a house in boulder colorado in 1945 he later included a gravel bed for heat storage ventilation fresh air or makeup air is required in most commercial industrial and institutional buildings to meet code requirements by drawing air through a properly designed unglazed transpired air collector or an air heater the solar heated fresh air can reduce the heating load during daytime operation many applications are now being installed where the transpired collector preheats the fresh air entering a heat recovery ventilator to reduce the defrost time of hrvs the higher your ventilation and temperature the better your payback time will be process heatingedit solar air heat is also used in process applications such as drying laundry crops ie tea corn coffee and other drying applications air heated through a solar collector and then passed over a medium to be dried can provide an efficient means by which to reduce the moisture content of the material solar air heating collector typesedit collectors are commonly classified by their air-ducting methods as one of three types through-pass collectors front-pass back pass combination front and back pass collectors collectors can also be classified by their outer surface glazed unglazed through-pass air collectoredit offering the highest efficiency of any solar technology the through-pass configuration air ducted onto one side of the absorber passes through a perforated material and is heated from the conductive properties of the material and the convective properties of the moving air through-pass absorbers have the most surface area which enables relatively high conductive heat transfer rates but significant pressure drop can require greater fan power and deterioration of certain absorber material after many years of solar radiation exposure can additionally create problems with air quality and performance back front and combination passage air collectoredit in back-pass front-pass and combination type configurations the air is directed on either the back the front or on both sides of the absorber to be heated from the return to the supply ducting headers although passing the air on both sides of the absorber will provide a greater surface area for conductive heat transfer issues with dust fouling can arise from passing air on the front side of the absorber which reduces absorber efficiency by limiting the amount of sunlight received in cold climates air passing next to the glazing will additionally cause greater heat loss resulting in lower overall performance of the collector glazed systemsedit glazed systems usually have a transparent top sheet and insulated side and back panels to minimize heat loss to ambient air the absorber plates in modern panels can have absorptivity of more than 93 glazed solar collectors recirculating types that are usually used for space heating air typically passes along the front or back of the absorber plate while scrubbing heat directly from it heated air can then be distributed directly for applications such as space heating and drying or may be stored for later use payback for glazed solar air heating panels can be less than 9–15 years depending on the fuel being replaced unglazed systemsedit unglazed systems or transpired air systems have been used to heat make-up or ventilation air in commercial industrial agriculture and process applications they consist of an absorber plate which air passes across or through as it scrubs heat from the absorber non-tranparent glazing materials are less expensive and decrease expected payback periods transpired collectors are considered unglazed because their collector surfaces are exposed to the elements are often not transparent and not hermetically sealed unglazed transpired solar collectorsedit backgroundedit the term unglazed air collector refers to a solar air heating system that consists of a metal absorber without any glass or glazing over top the most common type of unglazed collector on the market is the transpired solar collector the technology has been extensively monitored by these government agencies and natural resources canada developed the feasibility tool retscreen to model the energy savings from transpired solar collectors since that time several thousand transpired solar collector systems have been installed in a variety of commercial industrial institutional agricultural and process applications in countries around the world the technology was originally used primarily in industrial applications such as manufacturing and assembly plants where there were high ventilation requirements stratified ceiling heat and often negative pressure in the building with the increasing drive to install renewable energy systems on buildings transpired solar collectors are now used across the entire building stock because of high energy production up to 750 peak thermal wattssquare metre high solar conversion up to 90 and lower capital costs when compared against solar photovoltaic and solar water heating solar air heating is a renewable energy heating technology used to heat or condition air for buildings or process heat applications it is typically the most cost-effective of all the solar technologies especially in large scale applications and it addresses the largest usage of building energy in heating climates which is space heating and industrial process heating they are either glazed or unglazed method of operationedit unglazed air collectors heat ambient outside air instead of recirculated building air transpired solar collectors are usually wall-mounted to capture the lower sun angle in the winter heating months as well as sun reflection off the snow and achieve their optimum performance and return on investment when operating at flow rates of between 4 and 8 cfm per square foot  72 to 144 m3hm2 of collector area the exterior surface of a transpired solar collector consists of thousands of tiny micro-perforations that allow the boundary layer of heat to be captured and uniformly drawn into an air cavity behind the exterior panels this heated ventilation air is drawn under negative pressure into the buildings ventilation system where it is then distributed via conventional means or using a solar ducting system hot air that may enter an hvac system connected to a transpired collector that has air outlets positioned along the top of the collector particularly if the collector is west facing to counter this problem matrix energy has patented a transpired collector with a lower air outlet position and perforated cavity framing to perpetrate increased air turbulence behind the perforated absorber for increased performance this cutaway view shows the matrixair transpired solar collector components and air flow the lower air inlet mitigates the intake of heated air to the hvac system during summer operation the extensive monitoring by natural resources canada and nrel has shown that transpired solar collector systems reduce between 10-50 of the conventional heating load and that retscreen is an accurate predictor of system performance transpired solar collectors act as a rainscreen and they also capture heat loss escaping from the building envelope which is collected in the collector air cavity and drawn back into the ventilation system there is no maintenance required with solar air heating systems and the expected lifespan is over 30 years variations of transpired solar collectorsedit unglazed transpired collectors can also be roof-mounted for applications in which there is not a suitable south facing wall or for other architectural considerations matrix energy inc has patented a roof mounted product called the delta a modular roof-mounted solar air heating system where southerly east or west facing facades are simply not available each ten foot  3.05 m module will deliver 250 cfm  425 m3hof preheated fresh air typically providing annual energy savings of 1100 kwh  4 gj annually this unique two stage modular roof mounted transpired collector operating a nearly 90 efficiency each module delivering over 118 ls of preheated air per two square meter collector up to seven collectors may be connected in series in one row with no limit to the number of rows connected in parallel along one central duct typically yielding 4 cfm of preheated air per square foot of available roof area  transpired collectors can be configured to heat the air twice to increase the delivered air temperature making it suitable for space heating applications as well as ventilation air heating in a 2-stage system the first stage is the typical unglazed transpired collector and the second stage has glazing covering the transpired collector the glazing allows all of that heated air from the first stage to be directed through a second set of transpired collectors for a second stage of solar heating solar-thermal collectors generating electricityedit parabolic troughs dishes and towers described in this section are used almost exclusively in solar power generating stations or for research purposes although simple these solar concentrators are quite far from the theoretical maximum concentration 18 19 for example the parabolic trough concentration is about 1/3 of the theoretical maximum for the same acceptance angle that is for the same overall tolerances for the system approaching the theoretical maximum may be achieved by using more elaborate concentrators based on nonimaging optics 18 solar thermal collectors may also be used in conjunction with photovoltaic collectors to obtain combined heat and power 20 21 parabolic troughedit this type of collector is generally used in solar power plants a trough-shaped parabolic reflector is used to concentrate sunlight on an insulated tube dewar tube or heat pipe placed at the focal point containing coolant which transfers heat from the collectors to the boilers in the power station parabolic dishedit with a parabolic dish collector one or more parabolic dishes concentrate solar energy at a single focal point similar to the way a reflecting telescope focuses starlight or a dish antenna focuses radio waves this geometry may be used in solar furnaces and solar power plants the shape of a parabola means that incoming light rays which are parallel to the dishs axis will be reflected toward the focus no matter where on the dish they arrive light from the sun arrives at the earths surface almost completely parallel so the dish is aligned with its axis pointing at the sun allowing almost all incoming radiation to be reflected towards the focal point of the dish most losses in such collectors are due to imperfections in the parabolic shape and imperfect reflection losses due to atmospheric scattering are generally minimal however on a hazy or foggy day light is diffused in all directions through the atmosphere which reduces the efficiency of a parabolic dish significantly in dish stirling power plant designs a stirling engine coupled to a dynamo is placed at the focus of the dish this absorbs the energy focused onto it and converts it into electricity power toweredit a power tower is a large tower surrounded by tracking mirrors called heliostats these mirrors align themselves and focus sunlight on the receiver at the top of tower collected heat is transferred to a power station below this design reaches very high temperatures high temperatures are suitable for electricity generation using conventional methods like steam turbine or a direct high temperature chemical reaction such as liquid salt 22 by concentrating sunlight current systems can get better efficiency than simple solar cells a larger area can be covered by using relatively inexpensive mirrors rather than using expensive solar cells concentrated light can be redirected to a suitable location via optical fiber cable for such uses as illuminating buildings heat storage for power production during cloudy and overnight conditions can be accomplished often by underground tank storage of heated fluids molten salts have been used to good effect other working fluids such as liquid metals have also been proposed due to their superior thermal properties 23 however concentrating systems require sun tracking to maintain sunlight focus at the collector they are unable to provide significant power in diffused light conditions solar cells are able to provide some output even if the sky becomes cloudy but power output from concentrating systems drops drastically in cloudy conditions as diffused light cannot be concentrated appendixedit standardsedit iso test methods for solar collectors 24 en 12975 thermal
