local food local food local food movement or the locavores are a movement which aim to connect food producers and food consumers in the same geographic region in order to develop more self-reliant and resilient food networks improve local economies or for health environmental community or social impact in a particular place 1 the term has also been extended to include not only geographic location of supplier and consumer but can also be defined in terms of social and supply chain characteristics 2 for example local food initiatives often promote sustainable and organic farming practices although these are not explicitly related to the geographic proximity of the producer and consumer local food represents an alternative to the global food model a model which often sees food travelling long distances before it reaches the consumer a local food network involves relationships between food producers distributors retailers and consumers in a particular place where they work together to increase food security and ensure economic ecological and social sustainability of a community 3  contents 1 history 2 definitions of local 3 contemporary local food market 4 locavore and

proposed resolutions to the society for nutrition educations 1981 guidelines these largely unsuccessful resolutions encouraged increased local production to slow farmland loss the program described sustainable diets - a term then new to the american public at the time the resolutions were met with strong criticism from pro-business institutions but have had a strong resurgence of backing since the year 2000 4 in 2008 revisions were made to the united states farm bill and put an emphasis on nutrition it provides low-income seniors with vouchers for use at local produce markets and it added more than $1 billion to the fresh fruit and vegetable program which serves healthy snacks to 3 million low-income children in schools 5 definitions of localedit no single definition of local or local food systems exists the geographic distances between production and consumption varies within the movement however the general public recognizes that local describes the marketing arrangement eg farmers selling directly to consumers at regional farmers markets or to schools 6 there are a number of different definitions for local that have been used or recorded by researchers assessing local food systems and most are informed by political or geographic boundaries among the more widely circulated and popular defining parameters is the concept of food miles which has been suggested for policy recommendations 7 in 2008 congress passed hr.2419 which amended the consolidated farm and rural development act in the amendment locally and regionally are grouped together and are defined as i the locality or region in which the final product is marketed so that the total distance that the product is transported is less than 400 miles  640km from the origin of the product or ii the state in which the product is produced in may 2010 the usda acknowledged this definition in an informational leaflet 8 the concept of local is also seen in terms of ecology where food production is considered from the perspective of a basic ecological unit defined by its climate soil watershed species and local agrisystems a unit also called an ecoregion or a foodshed the concept of the foodshed is similar to that of a watershed it is an area where food is grown and eaten the term local is widely understood by the general public as a description of regional distribution of food though that does not involve a regulation of distance between the farmer their food and the consumer it is the consumers responsibility to conclude how local the food is contemporary local food marketedit the usda included statistics about the growing local food market in the leaflet released in may 2010 the statistics are as follows direct-to-consumer marketing amounted to $1.2 billion in current dollar sales in 2007 according to the 2007 census of agriculture compared with $551 million in 1997 direct-to-consumer sales accounted for 0.4 percent of total agricultural sales in 2007 up from 0.3 percent in 1997 if non-edible products are excluded from total agricultural sales direct-to-consumer sales accounted for 0.8 percent of agricultural sales in 2007 the number of farmers markets rose to 5,274 in 2009 up from 2,756 in 1998 and 1,755 in 1994 according to usdas agricultural marketing service in 2005 there were 1,144 community-supported agriculture organizations csas in operation up from 400 in 2001 and 2 in 1986 according to a study by the nonprofit nongovernmental organization national center for appropriate technology in early 2010 estimates exceeded 1,400 but the number could be much larger the number of farm to school programs which use local farms as food suppliers for school meals programs increased to 2,095 in 2009 up from 400 in 2004 and 2 in the 1996-97 school year according to the national farm to school network data from the 2005 school nutrition and dietary assessment survey sponsored by usdas food and nutrition service showed that 14 percent of school districts participated in farm to school programs and 16 percent reported having guidelines for purchasing locally grown produce 6 using metrics including some of those cited above a vermont-based farm and food advocacy organization strolling of the heifers annually publishes the locavore index a ranking of the 50 us states plus puerto rico and the district of columbia in the 2016 index the three top-ranking states in the index were vermont maine and oregon while the three lowest-ranking states were nevada texas and florida 9 networks of local farmers and producers are now collaborating in the uk canada and the us to provide online farmers markets to consumers this technological change enables more consumers to participate in farmers markets this development also allows local farmers and producers to harvest and prepare produce according to orders and means that farmers are also able to spread the website costs consumers have access to a huge inventory of farms and their products without having to be locked into buying whatever a csa provides websites now exist that aim to connect people to local food growers they often include a map where fruit and vegetable growers can pinpoint their location and advertise their produce supermarket chains also participate in the local food scene in 2008 walmart announced plans to invest $400 million in locally grown produce 10 other chains like wegmans a 71-store chain across the northeast has a long and cooperative history with the local food movement in this chains case each stores produce manager oversees the influx of local foods 10 a recent study led by miguel gomez a professor of applied economics and management at cornell university in cooperation with the atkinson center for a sustainable future found that in many instances the supermarket supply chain did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets the study suggests that selling locally grown foods through supermarkets may be more economically viable and sustainable than through farmers markets 11 locavore and invasivoreedit a locavore or localvore the term is a neologism is a person interested in eating food that is locally produced not moved long distances to market one common  but not universal  definition of local food is food grown within 100 miles  160km of its point of purchase or consumption 12 the locavore movement in the united states and elsewhere was spawned as a result of interest in sustainability and eco-consciousness becoming more prevalent 13 the word locavore was the word of the year for 2007 in the oxford american dictionary 14 the suffix vore comes from the latin word vorare as in devour and is used to form nouns indicating what kind of a diet an animal has this word was the creation of jessica prentice of the san francisco bay area at the time of world environment day 2005 15 it may be rendered localvore depending on regional differences 16 17 more recently an invasivore movement has emerged as a subset of the locavore movement which encourages the consumption of nonindigenous invasive species with the intent of controlling harmful populations 18 local food campaignsedit in order to stimulate use of local foods as well as better metrics for local food production availability and consumption a vermont-based farm and food advocacy organization strolling of the heifers annually publishes the locavore index a ranking of the 50 us states plus puerto rico and the district of columbia in the 2016 index the three top-ranking states in the index were vermont maine and oregon while the three lowest-ranking states were nevada texas and florida 9 locavores are interested in making an impact on their community by supporting the local farmers the locavore movement has been successful in supporting small local farmers after declining for more than a century the number of small farms has increased 20 in the past six years to 1.2 million according to the agriculture department 19 in the city of graz austria several restaurants display a sign with a genuss region logo which refers to the restaurant using ingredients from local sources and a commitment to the traditions of cultivating regional foods 20 north carolina 10 campaignedit launched in late 2009 north carolinas 10 campaign is aimed at stimulating economic development creating jobs and promoting north carolinas agricultural offerings 21 the campaign is a partnership between the center for environmental farming systems cefs with support from nc cooperative extension and the golden leaf foundation more than 4,600 individuals and 543 businesses including 76 restaurants have signed on to the campaign through the website nc10percentcom as they have pledged to spend 10 percent of their food budget on locally sourced foods participants receive weekly emails prompting them to record how much they have spent on local food that week currently the campaign reports that more than $14 million has been recorded by participants the $10 million mark is a true testament to the commitment of our agricultural community and the quality of north carolina-grown products 22 the center for environmental farming systems estimates that if all north carolinians allocated 10 of their food expenditures to locally produced food $3.5 billion would be generated for the states economy brunswick cabarrus chatham guilford forsyth onslow and rockingham counties have adopted resolutions in support of the campaign stores are advertising local products with buy-local food labels cefs co-director nancy creamer explains the following north carolina is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the increased consumer demand for locally produced foods agriculture is the backbone of our economy the states climate soils and coastal resources support production of a wide variety of produce meats fish and seafood 23 growing power incedit urban environments are known for their food deserts in areas of poverty and most of the food available is shipped in growing power inc combats has a mission of helping to provide equal access to healthy high-quality safe and affordable food for people in all communities 24 there are several different farms in the madison milwaukee and chicago area that are good agricultural practice gap certified the dill pickle food co-opedit since its inception in 2004 by 40 local residents dill pickle has remained connected with its regional people in chicago il this organization is a good example of the widespread support of local food as it grossed $1.3 million in revenue in its first year open in 2009 and since the people own this co-op it is influenced by the stakeholders to always uphold their local and fresh prerogative dill pickle utilizes a user-friendly interface their facility convenes all fresh local food in one location making it extremely convenient for its customers 25 fifth season co-opedit fifth season cooperative established in 2010 functions differently than most other local food co-ops in that it does not have a store front fifth season has six member classes encompassing everyone involved in getting local food from the ground to the table member classes include workers processors producer groups buyers and distributors the co-op functions as a food hub that helps to take down the barriers to market entry for smaller local growers and processors by offering gap auditing an insurance umbrella and connection to the distributor members sales network and logistics this model works well for moving large volumes of locally produced foods into local establishments that already serve the public such as restaurants hospitals and schools fifth season is located in viroqua wi and aggregates from a 150-mile  240km radius  26 motivations for eating localedit there are a number of reasons why people choose to participate in the locavore lifestyle these motivations include healthier food environmental benefits and economic or community benefits many local farmers that locavores turn to for their source of food use the crop rotation method when producing their organic crops this method not only aids in reducing the use of pesticides and pollutants but also keeps the soil in good condition rather than depleting it 27 also locavores seek out farmers close to where they live and this significantly reduces the amount of travel time taken for the food to get from the farm to the locavores table reducing the travel time makes it possible to transport the crops while they are still fresh without using chemical preservatives 28 the combination of local farming techniques and short travel distances makes the food consumed more likely to be organic and fresh which is an added benefit benefits of eating localedit community benefitsedit a community supported agriculture system is extremely beneficial to a community because it enables consumers to support local farmers obtain food that might be fresher than store-bought food and learn more information from farmers about how the food is grown furthermore local eating can support public objectives local eating can promote community interaction by fostering relationships between farmers and consumers even shopping experiences and interaction at local farmers markets have public benefits such as bonus-incentive or gleaning programs the hosting of health sessions and dissemination of informational materials and establishment of an organized central location that facilitates community engagement in fact farmers markets inspire more sociable behavior studies show that 75 of shoppers at farmers markets arrived in groups while only 16 of shoppers at supermarkets arrive in groups only 9 of customers in chain supermarkets had a social interaction with another customer and 14 had an interaction with an employee but at farmers markets 63 had an interaction with a fellow shopper and 42 had an interaction with an employee or farmer report 29 local food builds community vibrancy and retains local traditions while establishing a local identity through a unique sense of community obesity is a disease-prompting condition as it leads to fatal diseases such as hypertension diabetes pulmonary disease cardiovascular disease and depression every pound counts simply increase ones weight by 15 pounds and they raise their risk of getting diabetes by 50 30 obesity is defined as an energy imbalance whereby energy intake exceeds energy expenditure and the excess is stored as adipose tissue 31 this epidemic not only has an effect on physical health but mental health as well obesity correlates highly with depression as there is a negative social stigma surrounding the physicality of these people 32 obese individuals are assumed to be mean lazy and stupid they are less likely to gain the same high-paying jobs as thinner people they thus become a marginalized group this problem cannot simply be fixed by an increase in physical activity the foods that are available in america are extremely calorically dense and are designed to keep people coming back fat sugar and salt pull people in and begin a cycle of unhealthy eating from a young age obesity is the direct effect of a lack of local food accessibility people may argue that genetics play a large part in a persons weight but studies now show that genetics can only influence 30 of a persons physical stature 30 the rest relies on daily actions which are influenced by individual proclivities and their environment access and education surrounding local healthy food could be the key to solving this health crisis user groupsedit food accessibility is a topic that affects everyone in america supermarkets tend to carry foods that have been shipped halfway around the world chemically ripened and off-season however more affluent areas tend to have at least some access to local organic food it is the low-income communities that are especially vulnerable to food deserts areas in which there is little to no access to healthy food these neighborhoods are not only lacking healthy food they are overrun with unhealthy options disadvantaged neighborhoods are often replete with calorie-dense low-quality food options which adds to the obesity crisis rampant in america 33 in america many low-income areas correlate to highly african-american and hispanic populations so in many ways food deserts tend to continually marginalize these races these groups are then continually categorized as vulnerable populations the study conducted by taylor eagle et al gives a strong example between the correlation between socioeconomic class and accessibility to fruits and vegetables it also exemplifies the prevalence of unhealthy food in more impoverished areas of michigan cities 34 this study focused on a particular demographic children in school the test subjects are 6th grade children and although the focus is on mean income correlating with food consumption the test site is the cafeteria childhood obesity is highly linked to adult obesity so in order to make an impact one must target the younger subset targeting a younger subset is the best plan because to achieve full growth and reduce their risk of diseases children must eat healthy into their adolescent years 35 a cafeteria creates an atmosphere of little choice what you see is what you get according to terry huang schools play a vital and visible role in their communities 36 why is there no better model for food accessibility in these arenas children can become a user group for food accessibility as they are models for the future health of this country what children choose to eat at a young age will effect their food choices at an older age 35 in other words what we eat as children is what we will eat as adults unless change is forced at schools this trend continues even into college where students play an active role in changing the face of food college students are of one of the worst demographics of unhealthy eaters and this becomes a target for providing local natural food access 37 in all low-income areas and school children are undernourished and overfed low-income populations should focus on joining together as a community to ask for these local sources of food as well as educate their peers about the dangers of fast food school children should also have access to education to begin lifelong healthy-eating habits this opens up a pocket of opportunity that will not only aid health but also help build community in diverse areas environmental benefitsedit as stated in a new york times opinion piece foods that are minimally processed in season and locally grown like those available at farmers markets and backyard gardens are generally the most climate-friendly 38 they are the most climate friendly because the energy needed to store and transport the meat is removed from the equation there is a decrease in greenhouse gases emitted because locally grown goods do not need to be transported across the country or constantly cooled in large refrigerators another benefit of locally grown food is its lower concentration of pollution sources according to the usda more than 335 million tons of manure are produced annually in american farms in factory farms this waste is extremely concentrated and without proper regulation and disposal the waste pollutes the surrounding areas the natural resource defense council even remarks that factory farms have reached a point in which the farms threaten public health 39 pollutants from the manure and urine of overcrowded factory farms lead to water and air pollution some of these pollutants such as hydrogen sulfide and various nitrates are dangerous even at low levels factory farms are also considered unsanitary because they place animals in overcrowded conditions in fully enclosed rooms that often become the perfect breeding grounds for diseases locally grown foods support free-range or pasture-grazing farming methods decreasing the need for large factory farms with fewer factory farms waste will not be so concentrated and will thus not have such profound effects on the immediate surrounding areas growing and selling foods locally save our environment from serious detriments with local farms food miles can essentially be eliminated that includes the pollution that which accompanies it there would be no need to establish more expansive industrial farms that contaminates the soil whereas local farmers are able to preserve soil for sustainability economic benefitsedit a critical objective for any community is to promote investments that serve to increase the economic and social opportunities available for residents if the united states wishes to sustain current agricultural production in the future there must be a market for emerging farmers to counter the effects of a collectively aging farmer population the introduction of farmers markets into the local economy can have a direct positive impact on the lives of all citizens within the community in a study conducted in the state of iowa hood 2010 it was concluded that the introduction of 152 farmers markets into the state economy led to the creation of 576 jobs a $59.4 million increase in output and a $17.8 million increase in income ucsusa report 40 while this is just one state other studies conducted in different regions have produced similar results on the positive economic impact of more local farming on a specific community ottos study further reported that each individual farmers market produced 3.8 new jobs per market however these economic developments are not limited to local food markets surveys of towns in oregon lev brewer and stephenson  2003 found that farmers markets were the primary reason that tourists visited local towns on the weekend this gross economic impact can be calculated as in the case of the crescent city farmers market in new orleans where this single market contributed over $10 million to the local economy the potential reauthorization of the federal farmers market promotion program led to the creation of thousands of jobs within local economies and further collective economic growth the logical conclusion is that with the increase in economic benefits due to local farming room is created in this ever expanding industry criticismedit food milesedit critics of the local foods movement question the fundamental principles behind the push to eat locally for example the concept that fewer food miles translates to a more sustainable meal has not been supported by major scientific studies according to a study conducted at lincoln university in new zealand as a concept food miles has gained some traction with the popular press and certain groups overseas however this debate which only includes the distance food travels is spurious as it does not consider total energy use especially in the production of the product 41 the locavore movement has been criticized by dr vasile stănescu the co-senior editor of the critical animal studies book series as being idealistic and for not actually achieving the environmental benefits of the claim that the reduced food miles decreases the amount of gasses emitted 42 studies have shown that the amount of gasses saved by local transportation while existing does not have a significant enough impact to consider it a benefit the only study to date that directly focuses on whether or not a local diet is more helpful in reducing greenhouse gases was conducted by christopher l weber and h scott matthews at carnegie-mellon they concluded that dietary shift can be a more effective means of lowering an average households food-related climate footprint than buying local 43 environmental impactedit numerous studies have shown that locally and sustainably grown foods actually release more greenhouse gases than food made in factory farms the land degradation section of the united nations report livestocks long shadow concludes that intensification - in terms of increased productivity both in livestock production and in feed crop agriculture - can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation 44 furthermore nathan pelletier of dalhousie university in halifax nova scotia found that cattle raised on open pastures release 50 more greenhouse gas emissions than cattle raised in factory farms 45 additionally adrian williams of cranfield university in england found that free range and organic raised chickens have a 20 greater impact on global warming than chickens raised in factory farm conditions and organic egg production had a 14 higher impact on the climate than factory farm egg production stănescu vasille green eggs and ham the myth of sustainable meat and studies such as christopher webers report on food miles have shown that the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions in production far outweighs those in transportation which implies that locally grown food is actually worse for the environment than food made in factory farms economic feasibilityedit while locavorism has been promoted as a feasible alternative to modern food production some believe it might negatively affect the efficiency of production 46 as technological advances have influenced the amount of output of farms the productivity of farmers has skyrocketed in the last 70 years these latter criticisms combine with deeper concerns of food safety cited on the lines of the historical pattern of economic or food safety inefficiencies of
