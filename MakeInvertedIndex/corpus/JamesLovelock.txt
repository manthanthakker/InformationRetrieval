sustainable retreat 8.1 interviews  biographyedit james lovelock was born in letchworth garden city in hertfordshire england to working class parents who were strong believers in education nell his mother started work at 13 in a pickle factory his father tom had served six months hard labour for poaching in his teens and was illiterate until attending technical college the family moved to london where lovelocks dislike of authority made him by his own account an unhappy pupil at strand school 6 lovelock could not afford to go to university after school something which he believes helped prevent him becoming over-specialised and aided the development of gaia theory he worked at a photography firm attending birkbeck college during the evenings before being accepted to study chemistry at the university of manchester where he was a student of the nobel prize laureate professor alexander todd 7 lovelock worked at a quaker farm before a recommendation from his professor led to him taking up a medical research council post 1 working on ways of shielding soldiers from burns lovelock refused to use the shaved and anaesthetised rabbits that were used as burn victims and exposed his own skin to heat radiation instead an experience he describes as exquisitely painful 8 his student status enabled temporary deferment of military service during the second world war but he registered as a conscientious objector 9 he later abandoned this position in the light of nazi atrocities and tried to enlist in the armed forces but was told that his medical research was too valuable for the enlistment to be approved 10 in 1948 lovelock received a phd 11 degree in medicine at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine in the united states he has conducted research at yale baylor college of medicine and harvard university 1 careeredit a lifelong inventor lovelock has created and developed many scientific instruments some of which were designed for nasa in its program of planetary exploration it was while working as a consultant for nasa that lovelock developed the gaia hypothesis for which he is most widely known he also claims to have invented the microwave oven 12 in early 1961 lovelock was engaged by nasa to develop sensitive instruments for the analysis of extraterrestrial atmospheres and planetary surfaces the viking program that visited mars in the late 1970s was motivated in part to determine whether mars supported life and many of the sensors and experiments that were ultimately deployed aimed to resolve this issue during work on a precursor of this program lovelock became interested in the composition of the martian atmosphere reasoning that many life forms on mars would be obliged to make use of it and thus alter it however the atmosphere was found to be in a stable condition close to its chemical equilibrium with very little oxygen methane or hydrogen but with an overwhelming abundance of carbon dioxide to lovelock the stark contrast between the martian atmosphere and chemically dynamic mixture of that of the earths biosphere was strongly indicative of the absence of life on the planet 13 however when they were finally launched to mars the viking probes still searched unsuccessfully for extant life there lovelock invented the electron capture detector which ultimately assisted in discoveries about the persistence of cfcs and their role in stratospheric ozone depletion 14 15 16 after studying the operation of the earths sulphur cycle 17 lovelock and his colleagues robert jay charlson meinrat andreae and stephen g warren developed the claw hypothesis as a possible example of biological control of the earths climate 18 lovelock was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1974 he served as the president of the marine biological association mba from 1986 to 1990 and has been an honorary visiting fellow of green templeton college oxford formerly green college oxford since 1994 he has been awarded a number of prestigious prizes including the tswett medal  1975 an american chemical society chromatography award  1980 the world meteorological organization norbert gerbier prize  1988 the dr ah heineken prize for the environment  1990 and the royal geographical society discovery lifetime award  2001 in 2006 he received the wollaston medal the geological societys highest award whose previous recipients include charles darwin  2 he became a commander of the order of the british empire cbe in 1990 and a member of the companions of honour in 2003 he is a patron of population concern charity population matters as an independent scientist inventor and author lovelock worked out of a barn-turned-laboratory he called his experimental station located in a wooded valley on the devoncornwall border in the south-west of england 19 on 8 may 2012 he appeared on the radio four series the life scientific talking to jim al-khalili about the gaia hypothesis on the program he mentioned how his ideas had been received by various people including jonathan porritt he also mentioned how he had a claim for inventing the microwave oven he later explained this claim in an interview with the manchester magazine lovelock said that he did create an instrument during his time studying causes of damage to living cells and tissue which had according to him almost everything you would expect in an ordinary microwave oven he invented the instrument for the purpose of heating up frozen hamsters in a way that caused less suffering to the animals as opposed to the traditional way which involved putting red hot spoons on the animals chest to heat them up he believes that at the time nobody had gone that far and made an embodiment of an actual microwave oven however he does not claim to have been the first person to have the idea of using microwaves for cooking 20 cfcsedit after the development of his electron capture detector in the late 1960s lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of cfcs in the atmosphere 14 he found a concentration of 60 parts per trillion of cfc-11 over ireland and in a partially self-funded research expedition in 1972 went on to measure the concentration of cfc-11 from the northern hemisphere to the antarctic aboard the research vessel rrs shackleton 15 22 he found the gas in each of the 50 air samples that he collected but not realising that the breakdown of cfcs in the stratosphere would release chlorine that posed a threat to the ozone layer concluded that the level of cfcs constituted no conceivable hazard 22 he has since stated that he meant no conceivable toxic hazard however the experiment did provide the first useful data on the ubiquitous presence of cfcs in the atmosphere the damage caused to the ozone layer by the photolysis of cfcs was later discovered by sherwood rowland and mario molina after hearing a lecture on the subject of lovelocks results 23 sherwood and molina embarked on research that resulted in the first published paper that suggested a link between stratospheric cfcs and ozone depletion in 1974 for which they later shared the 1995 nobel prize in chemistry with paul crutzen 24 gaiaedit first formulated by lovelock during the 1960s as a result of work for nasa concerned with detecting life on mars 13 the gaia hypothesis proposes that living and non-living parts of the earth form a complex interacting system that can be thought of as a single organism 25 26 named after the greek goddess gaia at the suggestion of novelist william golding 22 the hypothesis postulates that the biosphere has a regulatory effect on the earths environment that acts to sustain life while the gaia hypothesis was readily accepted by many in the environmentalist community it has not been widely accepted within the scientific community among its most prominent critics are the evolutionary biologists richard dawkins ford doolittle and stephen jay gould  notable given the diversity of this trios views on other scientific matters these and other critics have questioned how natural selection operating on individual organisms can lead to the evolution of planetary-scale homeostasis 27 in response to this  together with andrew watson  lovelock published the computer model daisyworld in 1983 that postulated a hypothetical planet orbiting a star whose radiant energy is slowly increasing or decreasing 28 in the non-biological case the temperature of this planet simply tracks the energy received from the star however in the biological case ecological competition between daisy species with different albedo values produces a homeostatic effect on global temperature when energy received from the star is low black daisies proliferate since they absorb a greater fraction of the heat while when energy input is high white daisies are competitively advantaged since they reflect excess heat away as the daisies white and black affect the planets overall albedo and temperature changes in their relative populations act to stabilise the planets climate and to keep temperature within an optimal range despite changes in energy from the star lovelock argued that daisyworld although a parable illustrates how conventional natural selection operating on individual organisms can still produce planetary-scale homeostasis in lovelocks 2006 book the revenge of gaia he argues that the lack of respect humans have had for gaia through the damage done to rainforests and the reduction in planetary biodiversity is testing gaias capacity to minimize the effects of the addition of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere this eliminates the planets negative feedbacks and increases the likelihood of homeostatic positive feedback potential associated with runaway global warming similarly the warming of the oceans is extending the oceanic thermocline layer of tropical oceans into the arctic and antarctic waters preventing the rise of oceanic nutrients into the surface waters and eliminating the algal blooms of phytoplankton on which oceanic food chains depend as phytoplankton and forests are the main ways in which gaia draws down greenhouse gases particularly carbon dioxide taking it out of the atmosphere the elimination of this environmental buffering will see according to lovelock most of the earth becoming uninhabitable for humans and other life-forms by the middle of this century with a massive extension of tropical deserts in 2012 lovelock distanced himself from these conclusions saying he had gone too far in describing the consequences of climate change over the next century in this book 29 in his 2009 book the vanishing face of gaia 30 he rejects scientific modelling that disagrees with the scientific findings that sea levels are rising faster and arctic ice is melting faster than the models predict and he suggests that we may already be beyond the tipping point of terrestrial climate resilience into a permanently hot state given these conditions lovelock expects human civilization will be hard pressed to survive he expects the change to be similar to the paleocene-eocene thermal maximum when atmospheric concentration of co2 was 450 ppm at that point the arctic ocean was 23c and had crocodiles in it 31 32 with the rest of the world mostly scrub and desertcitation neededdubious  discuss nuclear poweredit lovelock has become concerned about the threat of global warming from the greenhouse effect in 2004 he caused a media sensation when he broke with many fellow environmentalists by pronouncing that only nuclear power can now halt global warming in his view nuclear energy is the only realistic alternative to fossil fuels that has the capacity to both fulfill the large scale energy needs of humankind while also reducing greenhouse emissions he is an open member of environmentalists for nuclear energy in 2005 against the backdrop of renewed uk government interest in nuclear power lovelock again publicly announced his support for nuclear energy stating i am a green and i entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy 33 although these interventions in the public debate on nuclear power are recent his views on it are longstanding in his 1988 book the ages of gaia he states i have never regarded nuclear radiation or nuclear power as anything other than a normal and inevitable part of the environment our prokaryotic forebears evolved on a planet-sized lump of fallout from a star-sized nuclear explosion a supernova that synthesised the elements that go to make our planet and ourselves 22 in the revenge of gaia 34  2006 where he puts forward the concept of sustainable retreat lovelock writes a television interviewer once asked me but what about nuclear waste will it not poison the whole biosphere and persist for millions of years i knew this to be a nightmare fantasy wholly without substance in the real world one of the striking things about places heavily contaminated by radioactive nuclides is the richness of their wildlife this is true of the land around chernobyl the bomb test sites of the pacific and areas near the united states savannah river nuclear weapons plant of the second world war wild plants and animals do not perceive radiation as dangerous and any slight reduction it may cause in their lifespans is far less a hazard than is the presence of people and their pets i find it sad but all too human that there are vast bureaucracies concerned about nuclear waste huge organisations devoted to decommissioning power stations but nothing comparable to deal with that truly malign waste carbon dioxide climateedit writing in the british newspaper the independent in january 2006 lovelock argued that as a result of global warming billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the arctic where the climate remains tolerable by the end of the 21st century 35 he has been quoted in the guardian that 80 of humans will perish by 2100 ad and this climate change will last 100,000 years according to james lovelock by 2040 the world population of more than six billion will have been culled by floods drought and famine indeed the people of southern europe as well as south-east asia will be fighting their way into countries such as canada australia and britain 36 by 2040 parts of the sahara desert will have moved into middle europe we are talking about paris  as far north as berlin in britain we will escape because of our oceanic position 36 if you take the intergovernmental panel on climate change predictions then by 2040 every summer in europe will be as hot as it was in 2003  between 110f and 120f it is not the death of people that is the main problem it is the fact that the plants cant grow there will be almost no food grown in europe 36 we are about to take an evolutionary step and my hope is that the species will emerge stronger it would be hubris to think humans as they now are gods chosen race 36 he further predicted the average temperature in temperate regions would increase by as much as 8c and by up to 5c in the tropics leaving much of the worlds land uninhabitable and unsuitable for farming with northerly migrations and new cities created in the arctic he predicted much of europe will have become uninhabitable having turned to desert and britain will have become europes life-raft due to its stable temperature caused by being surrounded by the ocean he suggested that we have to keep in mind the awesome pace of change and realise how little time is left to act and then each community and nation must find the best use of the resources they have to sustain civilisation for as long as they can 35 he partly retreated from this position in a september 2007 address to the world nuclear associations annual symposium suggesting that climate change would stabilise and prove survivable and that the earth itself is in no danger because it would stabilise in a new state life however might be forced to migrate en masse to remain in habitable climes 37 in 2009 he became a patron of population matters formerly known as the optimum population trust which campaigns for a gradual decline in the global human population to a sustainable level 38 in a march 2010 interview with the guardian newspaper he said that democracy might have to be put on hold to prevent climate change 39 he continued even the best democracies agree that when a major war approaches democracy must be put on hold for the time being i have a feeling that climate change may be an issue as severe as a war it may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while statements from 2012 portray lovelock as continuing his concern over global warming while at the same time criticizing extremism and suggesting alternatives to oil coal and the green solutions he does not support 29 in an april 2012 interview aired on msnbc lovelock stated that he had been alarmist using the words all right i made a mistake about the timing of climate change and noted the documentary an inconvenient truth and the book the weather makers as examples of the same kind of alarmism lovelock still believes the climate to be warming although the rate of change is not as he once thought he admitted that he had been extrapolating too far he believes that climate change is still happening but it will be felt farther in the future 29 of the claims the science is settled on global warming he states 40 one thing that being a scientist has taught me is that you can never be certain about anything you never know the truth you can only approach it and hope to get a bit nearer to it each time you iterate towards the truth you dont know it 40 he criticizes environmentalists for treating global warming like a religion 40 it just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the christian religion lovelock observed i dont think people have noticed that but its got all the sort of terms that religions use  the greens use guilt that just shows how religious greens are you cant win people round by saying they are guilty for putting carbon dioxide in the air 40 in the msnbc article lovelock is quoted as proclaiming 29 the problem is we dont know what the climate is doing we thought we knew 20 years ago that led to some alarmist books  mine included  because it looked clear-cut but it hasnt happened he continues the climate is doing its usual tricks theres nothing much really happening yet we were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world now he said the world has not warmed up very much since the millennium twelve years is a reasonable time  it the temperature has stayed almost constant whereas it should have been rising - carbon dioxide is rising no question about that he added 29 in a follow up interview lovelock stated his support for natural gas he now favors fracking as a low-polluting alternative to coal 19 40 he opposes the concept of sustainable development where modern economies might be powered by wind turbines calling it meaningless drivel 40 41 he keeps a poster of a wind turbine to remind himself how much he detests them 19 geoengineering climate engineeringedit in september 2007 lovelock and chris rapley proposed the construction of ocean pumps to pump water up from below the thermocline to fertilize algae in the surface waters and encourage them to bloom 42 the basic idea was to accelerate the transfer of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean by increasing primary production and enhancing the export of organic carbon as marine snow to the deep ocean a scheme similar to that proposed by lovelock and rapley is already being independently developed by a commercial company 43 the proposal attracted widespread media attention 44 45 46 47 and criticism 48 49 50 commenting on the proposal corinne le quéré a university of east anglia researcher said it doesnt make sense there is absolutely no evidence that climate engineering options work or even go in the right direction im astonished that they published this before any geoengineering is put to work a massive amount of research is needed  research which will take 20 to 30 years 44 other researchers have claimed that this scheme would bring water with high natural pco2 levels associated with the nutrients back to the surface potentially causing exhalation of co2 50 lovelock subsequently said that his proposal was intended to stimulate interest and research would be the next step 51 sustainable retreatedit sustainable retreat is a concept developed by james lovelock in order to define the necessary changes to human settlement and dwelling at the global scale with the purpose of adapting to global warming and preventing its expected negative consequences on humans 52 lovelock thinks the time is past for sustainable development and that we have come to a time when development is no longer sustainable therefore we need to retreat lovelock states the following in order to explain the concept 53 retreat in his view means its time to start talking about changing where we live and how we get our food about making plans for the migration of millions of people from low-lying regions like bangladesh into europe about admitting that new orleans is a goner and moving the people to cities better positioned for the future most of all he says its about everybody absolutely doing their utmost to sustain civilization so that it doesnt degenerate into dark ages with warlords running things which is a real danger we could lose everything that way the concept of sustainable retreat emphasized a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs with lower levels andor less environmentally harmful types of resources awards and honoursedit lovelock was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1974 his nomination reads lovelock has made distinguished contributions to several diverse fields including a study of the transmission of respiratory infection and methods of air sterilisation the role of ca and other divalent ions in blood clotting damage to various living cells by freezing thawing and thermal shock and its prevention by the presence of neutral solutes methods of freezing and thawing small live animals methods for preparing sperm for artificial insemination which have been of major economic importance he has invented a family of ionisation detectors for gas chromatography his electron capture detectors are the most sensitive that have been made and are universally used on pollution problems for residual halogen compounds he has many inventions including a gas chromatograph which will be used to investigate planetary atmospheres his chromatographic work has led to investigation of blood lipids in various animals including arteriosclerotic humans he has made a study of detecting life on other planets by analysis of their atmosphere and extended this to world pollution problems his work generally shows remarkable originality simplicity and ingenuity 2 bibliographyedit lovelock james  2014 a rough ride
