by the spanish empire as part of alta california in the larger territory of new spain alta california became a part of mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence but was ceded to the united states in 1848 after the mexicanamerican war the western portion of alta california was organized as the state of california which was admitted as the 31st state on september 9 1850 the california gold rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom californias diverse geography ranges from the sierra nevada in the east to the pacific coast in the west from the redwooddouglas fir forests of the northwest to the mojave desert areas in the southeast the center of the state is dominated by the central valley a major agricultural area california contains both the highest point mount whitney and the lowest point death valley in the contiguous united states

states states of california nevada and utah and parts of arizona new mexico texas and wyomingcitation needed the name california is surmised by some writers to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by black amazons and ruled by queen calafia 18 19 who fought alongside muslims and whose name was chosen to echo the title of a muslim leader the caliph fictionally implying that california was the caliphate 20 the story of calafia is recorded in a 1510 work the adventures of esplandián written as a sequel to amadis de gaula by spanish adventure writer garci rodríguez de montalvo 21 22 23 the kingdom of queen calafia according to montalvo was said to be a remote land inhabited by griffins and other strange beasts and rich in gold know ye that at the right hand of the indies there is an island called california very close to that part of the terrestrial paradise which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them and they lived in the manner of amazons they were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue the island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks when spanish explorer francisco de ulloa was exploring the western coast of north america his initial surveys of the baja peninsula led him to believe that it was an island rather than part of the larger continent so he dubbed the island after the mythical island in montalvos writing 25 shortened forms of the states name include ca cal calif and us-ca history pre-contact settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000 years california was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-columbian north america various estimates of the native population range from 100,000 to 300,000 26 the indigenous peoples of california included more than 70 distinct groups of native americans ranging from large settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior california groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands tribes villages and on the resource-rich coasts large chiefdoms such as the chumash pomo and salinan trade intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups 16th 17th and 18th centuries the first european effort to explore the coast as far north as the russian river was a spanish sailing expedition led by portuguese captain juan rodríguez cabrillo in 1542 some 37 years later english explorer francis drake also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the california coast in 1579 spanish traders made unintended visits with the manila galleons on their return trips from the philippines beginning in 1565 27 the first asians to set foot on what would be the united states occurred in 1587 when filipino sailors arrived in spanish ships at morro bay 28 sebastián vizcaíno explored and mapped the coast of california in 1602 for new spain despite the on-the-ground explorations of california in the 16th century rodríguezs idea of california as an island persisted that depiction appeared on many european maps well into the 18th century 29 after the portolà expedition of 1769-70 spanish missionaries began setting up 21 california missions on or near the coast of alta upper california beginning in san diego during the same period spanish military forces built several forts presidios and three small towns pueblos two of the pueblos grew into the cities of los angeles and san jose the spanish colonization brought the genocide of the indigenous californian peoples 19th century imperial russia explored the california coast and established a trading post at fort ross its early 19th-century coastal settlements north of san francisco bay constituted the southernmost russian colony in north america and were spread over an area stretching from point arena to tomales bay 31 in 1821 the mexican war of independence gave mexico including california independence from spain for the next 25 years alta california remained a remote northern province of the nation of mexico cattle ranches or ranchos emerged as the dominant institutions of mexican california after mexican independence from spain the chain of missions became the property of the mexican government and were secularized by 1834 32 the ranchos developed under ownership by californios spanish-speaking californians who had received land grants and traded cowhides and tallow with boston merchants from the 1820s trappers and settlers from the united states and canada arrived in northern california these new arrivals used the siskiyou trail california trail oregon trail and old spanish trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding california between 1831 and 1836 california experienced a series of revolts against mexico 33 this culminated in the 1836 california revolt led by juan bautista alvarado which ended after mexico appointed him governor of the department 34 the revolt which had momentarily declared california an independent state was successful with the assistance of american and british residents of california 35 including isaac graham 36 after 1840 100 of those residents who did not have passports were arrested leading to the graham affair in 1840 35 one of the largest ranchers in california was john marsh after failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the mexican courts he determined that california should become part of the united states marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing the california climate soil and other reasons to settle there as well as the best route to follow which became known as marshs route his letters were read reread passed around and printed in newspapers throughout the country and started the first wagon trains rolling to california 37 he invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled and assisted in their obtaining passports 38 after ushering in the period of organized emigration to california marsh helped end the rule of the last mexican governor of california thereby paving the way to californias ultimate acquisition by the united states 39 in 1846 settlers rebelled against mexican rule during the bear flag revolt afterwards rebels raised the bear flag featuring a bear a star a red stripe and the words california republic at sonoma the republics only president was william b ide 40 who played a pivotal role during the bear flag revolt the california republic was short lived 41 the same year marked the outbreak of the mexicanamerican war  1846–48 42 when commodore john d sloat of the united states navy sailed into monterey bay and began the military occupation of california by the united states northern california capitulated in less than a month to the united states forces 43 after a series of defensive battles in southern california the treaty of cahuenga was signed by the californios on january 13 1847 securing american control in california 44 following the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo that ended the war the western territory of alta california became the united states state of california and arizona nevada colorado and utah became united states territories the lightly populated lower region of california the baja peninsula remained in the possession of mexico in 1846 the non-native population of california was estimated to be no more than 8,000 plus about 100,000 native americans down from about 300,000 before hispanic settlement in 1769 45 after gold was discovered in 1848 the population burgeoned with united states citizens europeans chinese and other immigrants during the great california gold rush by 1854 over 300,000 settlers had come 46 between 1847 and 1870 the population of san francisco increased from 500 to 150,000 47 on september 9 1850 as part of the compromise of 1850 california was admitted to the united states undivided as a free state denying the expansion of slavery to the pacific coast californias native population precipitously declined above all from eurasian diseases to which they had no natural immunity 48 as in other states the native inhabitants were forcibly removed from their lands by incoming miners ranchers and farmers and although california entered the union as a free state the loitering or orphaned indians were de facto enslaved by mexican and anglo-american masters under the 1853 act for the government and protection of indians 49 there were massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed between 1850 and 1860 california paid around 1.5 million dollars some 250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government 50 to hire militias whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations in later decades the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them 49 as a result the rise of california was a calamity for the native inhabitants several scholars and native american activists including benjamin madley and ed castillo have described the actions of the california government as a genocide 51 the seat of government for california under spanish and later mexican rule was located at monterey from 1777 until 1845 32 pio pico last mexican governor of alta california moved the capital to los angeles in 1845 the united states consulate was also located in monterey under consul thomas o larkin in 1849 the constitutional convention was first held in monterey among the tasks was a decision on a location for the new state capital the first legislative sessions were held in san jose  1850–1851 subsequent locations included vallejo  1852–1853 and nearby benicia  1853–1854 these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well the capital has been located in sacramento since 1854 52 with only a short break in 1861 when legislative sessions were held in san francisco due to flooding in sacramento initially travel between california and the rest of the continental united states was time consuming and dangerous a more direct connection came in 1869 with the completion of the first transcontinental railroad through donner pass in the sierra nevada mountains once completed hundreds of thousands of united states citizens came west where new californians were discovering that land in the state if irrigated during the dry summer months was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general vast expanses of wheat other cereal crops vegetable crops cotton and nut and fruit trees were grown including oranges in southern california and the foundation was laid for the states prodigious agricultural production in the central valley and elsewhere 20th century migration to california accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the lincoln highway and route 66 in the period from 1900 to 1965 the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the union in 1940 the census bureau reported californias population as 6.0 hispanic 2.4 asian and 89.5 non-hispanic white 53 to meet the populations needs major engineering feats like the california and los angeles aqueducts the oroville and shasta dams and the bay and golden gate bridges were built across the state the state government also adopted the california master plan for higher education in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education meanwhile attracted to the mild mediterranean climate cheap land and the states wide variety of geography filmmakers established the studio system in hollywood in the 1920s california manufactured 8.7 percent of total united states military armaments produced during world war ii ranking third behind new york and michigan among the 48 states 54 after world war ii californias economy greatly expanded due to strong aerospace and defense industries 55 whose size decreased following the end of the cold war 55 56 stanford university and its dean of engineering frederick terman began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in california instead of leaving the state and develop a high-tech region in the area now known as silicon valley 57 as a result of these efforts california is regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries of technology engineering and the aerospace industry and as the united states center of agricultural production 58 just before the dot com bust california had the 5th largest economy in the world among nations 59 yet since 1991 and starting in the late 1980s in southern california california has seen a net loss of domestic migrants most years this is often referred to by the media as the california exodus 60 however during the 20th century two great disasters happened in california the 1906 san francisco earthquake and 1928 st francis dam flood remain the deadliest in us history 61 geography california is the 3rd largest state in the united states in area after alaska and texas 63 california is often geographically bisected into two regions southern california comprising the 10 southernmost counties 64 65 and northern california comprising the 48 northernmost counties 66 67 in the middle of the state lies the california central valley bounded by the sierra nevada in the east the coastal mountain ranges in the west the cascade range to the north and by the tehachapi mountains in the south the central valley is californias productive agricultural heartland divided in two by the sacramento-san joaquin river delta the northern portion the sacramento valley serves as the watershed of the sacramento river while the southern portion the san joaquin valley is the watershed for the san joaquin river both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them with dredging the sacramento and the san joaquin rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be seaports the sacramento-san joaquin river delta is a critical water supply hub for the state water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of pumps and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state to the central valley and the state water projects and other needs water from the delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people almost two-thirds of the states population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the san joaquin valley the channel islands are located off the southern coast the sierra nevada spanish for snowy range includes the highest peak in the contiguous 48 states mount whitney at 14,505 feet  4,421m 5 6 7 the range embraces yosemite valley famous for its glacially carved domes and sequoia national park home to the giant sequoia trees the largest living organisms on earth and the deep freshwater lake lake tahoe the largest lake in the state by volume to the east of the sierra nevada are owens valley and mono lake an essential migratory bird habitat in the western part of the state is clear lake the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in california though lake tahoe is larger it is divided by the californianevada border the sierra nevada falls to arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers including palisade glacier the southernmost glacier in the united states about 45 percent of the states total surface area is covered by forests 68 and californias diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state california contains more forestland than any other state except alaska many of the trees in the california white mountains are the oldest in the world an individual bristlecone pine is over 5,000 years old 69 70 in the south is a large inland salt lake the salton sea the south-central desert is called the mojave to the northeast of the mojave lies death valley which contains the lowest and hottest place in north america the badwater basin at −279 feet −85m 9 the horizontal distance from the bottom of death valley to the top of mount whitney is less than 90 miles  140km indeed almost all of southeastern california is arid hot desert with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer the southeastern border of california with arizona is entirely formed by the colorado river from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water along the california coast are several major metropolitan areas including the greater los angeles area the san francisco bay area and the san diego metropolitan area as part of the ring of fire california is subject to tsunamis floods droughts santa ana winds wildfires landslides on steep terrain and has several volcanoes it has many earthquakes due to several faults running through the state in particular the san andreas fault climate although most of the state has a mediterranean climate due to the states large size the climate ranges from subarctic to subtropical the cool california current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast farther inland there are colder winters and hotter summers the maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of los angeles and san francisco being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the united states and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the north american continent even the san diego shoreline bordering mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous united states just a few miles inland summer temperature extremes are significantly higher with downtown los angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast the same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the bay area where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas that are close to the ocean northern parts of the state have more rain than the south californias mountain ranges also influence the climate some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes northwestern california has a temperate climate and the central valley has a mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast the high mountains including the sierra nevada have an alpine climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer californias mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side creating extensive deserts the higher elevation deserts of eastern california have hot summers and cold winters while the low deserts east of the southern california mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters death valley a desert with large expanses below sea level is considered the hottest location in the world the highest temperature in the world 71 72 134f  56.7c was recorded there on july 10 1913 the lowest temperature in california was −45f −43c in 1937 in boca the table below lists average temperatures for august and december in some of the major urban areas of california since extremes like the cool summers of the humboldt bay and the extreme heat of death valley do not effect any major urban areas these are not listed ecology california is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities california is part of the nearctic ecozone and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions 74 californias large number of endemic species includes relict species which have died out elsewhere such as the catalina ironwood lyonothamnus floribundus many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the california lilac ceanothus many california endemics have become endangered as urbanization logging overgrazing and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat flora and fauna california boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora the largest trees the tallest trees and the oldest trees californias native grasses are perennial plants 75 after european contact these were generally replaced by invasive species of european annual grasses and in modern times californias hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer 76 because california has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain the state has six life zones which are the lower sonoran desert upper sonoran foothill regions and some coastal lands transition coastal areas and moist northeastern counties and the canadian hudsonian and arctic zones comprising the states highest elevations 77 plant life in the dry climate of the lower sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus mesquite and paloverde the joshua tree is found in the mojave desert flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of asters fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive in the central valley the upper sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt characterized by forests of small shrubs stunted trees and herbaceous plants nemophila mint phacelia viola and the california poppy eschscholzia californica  the state flower  also flourish in this zone along with the lupine more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world 77 the transition zone includes most of californias forests with the redwood sequoia sempervirens and the big tree or giant sequoia sequoiadendron giganteum among the oldest living things on earth some are said to have lived at least 4,000 years tanbark oak california laurel sugar pine madrona broad-leaved maple and douglas-fir also grow here forest floors are covered with swordfern alumnroot barrenwort and trillium and there are thickets of huckleberry azalea elder and wild currant characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa tulip and tiger and leopard lilies 78 the high elevations of the canadian zone allow the jeffrey pine red fir and lodgepole pine to thrive brushy areas are abundant with dwarf manzanita and ceanothus the unique sierra puffball is also found here right below the timberline in the hudsonian zone the whitebark foxtail and silver pines grow at about 10,500 feet  3,200m begins the arctic zone a treeless region

california state water project diverting water from northern to southern california the states coasts rivers and other bodies of water are regulated by the california coastal commission the two most prominent rivers within california are the sacramento river and the san joaquin river which drain the central valley and the west slope of the sierra nevada and flow to the pacific ocean through san francisco bay several major tributaries feed into the sacramento and the san joaquin including the pit river the tuolumne river and the feather river the eel river and salinas river each drain portions of the california coast north and south of san francisco bay respectively and the eel river is the largest river in the state to remain in its natural un-dammed state the mojave river is the primary watercourse in the mojave desert and the santa ana river drains much of the transverse ranges as it bisects southern california some other important rivers are the klamath river and the

california-born residents make up the majority of the states population 107 along with the rest of the united states californias immigration pattern has also shifted over the course of the late 2000s-early 2010s 108 immigration from latin american countries has dropped significantly with most immigrants now coming from asia 109 in total for 2011 there were 277,304 immigrants 57 came from asian countries vs 22 from latin american countries 109 net immigration from mexico previously the most common country of origin for new immigrants has dropped to zeroless than zero since more mexican

state californian culture has been greatly influenced by several large immigrant populations especially those from latin america and asia 135 california has long been a subject of interest in the public mind and has often been promoted by its boosters as a kind of paradise in the early 20th century fueled by the efforts of state and local boosters many americans saw the golden state as an ideal resort destination sunny and dry all year round with easy access to the ocean and mountains in the 1960s popular music groups such as the beach boys promoted the image of californians as

proposition 13 infrastructure energy because it is the most populous united states state california is one of the countrys largest users of energy however because of its high energy rates conservation mandates mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any united states state 168 due to the high electricity demand california imports more electricity than any other state primarily hydroelectric power from states in the pacific northwest via path 15 and path 66 and coal- and natural gas-fired production from the desert southwest via path 46 169 as a result of the states strong environmental movement california has some of the most aggressive renewable energy goals in the united states with a target for california to obtain a third of its electricity from renewables by 2020 170 currently several solar power plants such as the solar energy generating systems facility are located in the mojave desert californias wind farms include altamont pass san gorgonio pass and tehachapi pass several dams across the state provide hydro-electric power it would be possible to convert the total supply to 100 renewable energy including heating cooling and mobility by 2050 171 the states crude oil and natural gas deposits are located in the central valley and along the coast including the large midway-sunset oil field natural gas-fired power plants typically account for more than one-half of state electricity generation california is also home to two major nuclear power plants diablo canyon

controlled-access highways freeways limited-access roads expressways and highways california is known for its car culture giving californias cities a reputation for severe traffic congestion construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the california department of transportation nicknamed caltrans the rapidly growing population of the state is straining all of its transportation networks and california has some of the worst roads in the united states 174 175 the reason foundations 19th annual report on the performance of state highway systems ranked californias highways the third-worst of any state with alaska second and rhode island first 176 the state has been a pioneer in road construction one of the states more visible landmarks the golden gate bridge was once the longest suspension bridge main span in the world at 4,200 feet  1,300m when it opened in 1937 with its orange paint and panoramic

agricultural and urban sectors especially in the arid southern portion of the state the states widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists the california water wars a conflict between los angeles and the owens valley over water rights is one of the most well-known examples of the struggle to secure adequate water supplies 186 former california governor arnold schwarzenegger said weve been in crisis for quite some time because were now 38 million people and not anymore 18 million people like we were in the late 60s so it developed into a battle
