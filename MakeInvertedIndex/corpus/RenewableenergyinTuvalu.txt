renewable energy in tuvalu renewable energy in tuvalu is a growing sector of the countrys energy supply tuvalu has committed to becoming the first country to get 100 of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020 this is considered possible because of the small size of the population of tuvalu and its abundant solar energy resources due to its tropical location it is somewhat complicated because tuvalu consists of nine inhabited islands the tuvalu national energy policy tnep was formulated in 2009 and the energy strategic action plan defines and directs current and future energy developments so that tuvalu can achieve the ambitious target of 100 renewable energy for power generation by 2020 1 the program is expected to cost 20 million us dollars and is supported by the e8 a group of 10 electric companies from g8 countries 2 the government of tuvalu worked with the e8 group to develop the tuvalu solar power project which is a 40kw grid-connected solar system that is intended to provide about 5 of funafutis peak demand and 3 of the tuvalu electricity corporations annual household consumption 2 tuvalu participates in the alliance of small island states aosis which is a coalition of small island and low-lying coastal countries that have concerns about their vulnerability to the adverse effects of global climate change under the majuro declaration which was signed on 5 september 2013 tuvalu has commitment to implement power generation of 100 renewable energy between 2013 and 2020 which is proposed to be implemented using solar pv  95 of demand and biodiesel  5 of demand the feasibility of wind power generation will be considered 3 in november 2015 tuvalu committed to reduction of emissions of green-house gases from the electricity generation

electricity generation facilities that use imported diesel brought in by ships the tuvalu electricity corporation tec on the main island of funafuti operates the large power station  2000kw 5 funafutis power station comprises three 750kva diesel generators with 11kv operating voltage which was installed in 2007 total power output is 1,800kw the old generators have remained offline  1920kw but are available as back-up to the main system the cost of diesel is subsidised by approximately 40 of the annual fuel consumption through the japan non project grant assistance npga although this subsidy may end which will expose the true cost of diesel generation of electricity 1 seven of the eight outer islands are powered by 48 - 80kw each diesel generators with a total generating capacity per island averaging 176kw although vaitupu generates 208kw and nukulaelae generates 144kw niulakita operates individual dc home solar systems in the other islands the diesel generators are run for 12â€“18 hours per day 1 for the small power stations on the outlying islands fuel has to be transferred to 200 liter  55 gallon barrels and offloaded from the ships a small project to power the inter-island telecommunications systems by photovoltaics began in 1979 but was mismanaged 6 a project installed hundreds of small household solar systems as well as solar powered medical refrigerators beginning in the early 1980s but poor training and management led to installation and maintenance problems 7 tuvalu barely above sea level at any point is concerned over global warming and sea level rise and see its use of renewable energy as a moral example for others whose influence is greater kausea natano tuvalus minister for public utilities and industries in the telavi ministry stated this as we thank those who are helping tuvalu reduce its carbon footprint as it will strengthen our voice in upcoming international negotiations and we look forward to the day when our nation offers an example to all -- powered entirely by natural resources such as the sun and the wind 8 tuvalu energy sector development project esdpedit in 2014 the tuvalu electricity corporation tec began implementing a master plan for renewable energy and energy efficiency mpreee through the tuvalu energy sector development project esdp which builds on the tuvalu national energy policy 2009 9 commitment under the majuro declaration 2013edit the sopoaga ministry led by enele sopoaga made a commitment under the majuro declaration which was signed on 5 september 2013 to implement power generation of 100 renewable energy between 2013 and 2020 this commitment is proposed to be implemented using solar pv  95 of demand and biodiesel  5 of demand the feasibility of wind power generation will be considered 3 commitment under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc 1994edit on 27 november 2015 the government of tuvalu announced its intended nationally determined contributions ndcs in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gases ghgs under provisions of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which became effective on 21 march 1994 solar energyedit in 2007 tuvalu was getting 2 of its energy from solar 10 through 400 small systems managed by the tuvalu solar electric co-operative society these were installed beginning in 1984 and in the late 1990s 34 of families in the outer islands had a pv system which generally powered 1-3 lights and perhaps a few hours a day of radio use 7 each of the eight islands had a medical center with a pv-powered vaccine refrigerator and each islands solar technician had a larger pv system which ran a household refrigerator followup on the installations showed no deterioration of the pv panels but switches and light fixtures had suffered damage or failed from the salt air the implementation of the tuvalu solar power project in 2008-9 involved the installation of a 40kw grid-connected solar system that is intended to provide about 5 of funafutis peak demand and 3 of tecs annual household consumption 2 the first large scale system in tuvalu was a 40kw solar panel installation on the roof of tuvalu sports ground 11 12 this grid-connected 40kw solar system was established in 2008 by the e8 and japan government through kansai electric company japan and contributes 1 of electricity production on funafuti 1 future plans include expanding this plant to 60kw a 46kw solar installation with battery storage at the motufoua secondary school on vaitupu island was brought online on 27 november 2009 13 at the date of installation it was described as the largest diesel-solar photovoltaic pv hybrid electricity system in the south pacific 14 prior to the installment of the system the residential school relied upon a diesel powered generator which needed to be turned off during the night the hybrid system systems saves thousands of dollars in diesel costs and provides the school with a 24-hour supply of energy with up to 200kw per day 14 15 funding for further pv solar system grid-tied systems was announced in late 2011 for funafuti with the funding provided by the pacific environment community pec fund 16 in 2015 a new zealand aid programme resulted in solarcity and infratec renewables two new zealand companies installing photovoltaic panels on government buildings on funafuti these pv panels are expected to generate 170kw of electricity and are estimated to deliver 5 percent of the energy requirements for funafuti and will reduce tuvalus dependence on diesel by up to 62,000 litres 17 a non-profit alofa tuvalu is promoting solar water heating and solar ovens as well as investigating producing biogas biodiesel and ethanol 18 19 in january 2014 tuvalu signed an agreement with masdar a uae government company which will provided us$3 million in aid to help tuvalu solarize the outer islands so as to reduce reliance on fossil fuel for electricity generation 20 21 in 2014 new zealand and the european union agreed to provide finance to the government of tuvalu to install battery-backed solar photovoltaic pv systems on the outer islands 22 the 191kwp project will provide the islands with 24 hours-a-day electricity and allow tuvalu to save up to 120,000 litres of diesel per year which will amount to a reduction in spending on diesel of about au$200,000 per year 23 this project will result in the construction of four small scale solar-hybrid systems that are to be located on vaitupu nanumanga nanumea and niutao from january to march 2015 powersmart a new zealand company implemented german solar power technology to build the new vaitupu powerhouse 24 25 with the next solar-hybrid system being built on nanumaga in september 26 the 2015 installation program continued with nanumea in october and niutao in november 27 wind energyedit wind power is also mentioned as a future electricity source 28 tuvalus commitment as part of the majuro declaration is to implement power generation of 100 renewable energy between 2013 and 2020 the feasibility of wind power generation will be considered as part of this commitment 3 filmographyedit soccer stands solar installation  2012 video by kansai electric power company the project developer tuvalu renewable energy in the pacific islands series
