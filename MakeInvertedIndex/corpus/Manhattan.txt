yacht halve maen half moon 33 a 1610 map depicts the name as manna-hata twice on both the west and east sides of the mauritius river later named the hudson river the word manhattan has been translated as island of many hills from the lenape language 34 the united states postal service prefers that mail addressed to manhattan use new york ny rather than manhattan ny 35 historyedit v t e colonial eraedit the area that is now manhattan was long inhabited by the lenape native americans in 1524 florentine explorer giovanni da verrazzano sailing in service of king francis i of france was the first european to visit the area that would become new york city he entered the tidal strait now known as the narrows aboard his ship la dauphine and named the land around upper new york harbor new angoulême in reference to the family name of king francis i that was derived from angoulême in france he sailed far enough into the harbor to sight the hudson river which he referred to in his report to the french king as a very big river and he named the bay of santa margarita  what is now upper new york bay  after marguerite de navarre the elder sister of the king 36 37 it was not until the voyage of henry hudson an englishman who worked for the dutch east india company that the area was mapped 38 hudson came across manhattan island and the native people living there in 1609 and continued up the river that would later bear his name the hudson river until he arrived at the site of present day albany 39 a permanent european presence in new netherland began in 1624 with the founding of a dutch fur trading settlement on governors island in 1625 construction was started on the citadel of fort amsterdam on manhattan island later called new amsterdam nieuw amsterdam in what is now lower manhattan 41 42 the 1625 establishment of fort amsterdam at the southern tip of manhattan island is recognized as the birth of new york city 43 according to a letter by pieter janszoon schagen peter minuit and dutch colonists acquired manhattan on may 24 1626 from unnamed native american people which are believed to have been canarsee indians of the lenape 44 in exchange for trade goods worth 60 guilders 15 often said to be worth us$24 although accounting for inflation it actually amounts to around us$1,050 in 2014 45 according to the writer nathaniel benchley minuit conducted the transaction with seyseys chief of the canarsees who were only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for the island that was actually mostly controlled by the weckquaesgeeks 46 in 1647 peter stuyvesant was appointed as the last dutch director general of the colony 47 new amsterdam was formally incorporated as a city on february 2 1653 48 in 1664 the english conquered new netherland and renamed it new york after the english duke of york and albany the future king james ii 49 the dutch under director general stuyvesant successfully negotiated with the english to produce 24 articles of provisional transfer which sought to retain for the extant citizens of new netherland their previously attained liberties including freedom of religion under new colonial english rulers 50 51 the dutch republic regained it in august 1673 with a fleet of 21 ships renaming the city new orange new netherland was ceded permanently to the english in november 1674 through the treaty of westminster 52 in exchange for run island which was the long-coveted last link in the dutch nutmeg trading monopoly in indonesia 53 american revolution and the early united statesedit manhattan was at the heart of the new york campaign a series of major battles in the early american revolutionary war the continental army was forced to abandon manhattan after the battle of fort washington on november 16 1776 the city greatly damaged by the great fire of new york during the campaign became the british political and military center of operations in north america for the remainder of the war 54 british occupation lasted until november 25 1783 when george washington returned to manhattan as the last british forces left the city 55 from january 11 1785 to the fall of 1788 new york city was the fifth of five capitals of the united states under the articles of confederation with the continental congress meeting at new york city hall then at fraunces tavern new york was the first capital under the newly enacted constitution of the united states from march 4 1789 to august 12 1790 at federal hall 56 federal hall was also the site of where the united states supreme court met for the first time 57 the united states bill of rights were drafted and ratified 58 and where the northwest ordinance was adopted establishing measures for adding new states to the union 59 19th centuryedit new york grew as an economic center first as a result of alexander hamiltons policies and practices as the first secretary of the treasury and later with the opening of the erie canal in 1825 which connected the atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the midwestern united states and canada 60 61 by 1810 new york city then confined to manhattan had surpassed philadelphia as the largest city in the united states 62 tammany hall a democratic party political machine began to grow in influence with the support of many of the immigrant irish culminating in the election of the first tammany mayor fernando wood in 1854 tammany hall dominated local politics for decades central park which opened to the public in 1858 became the first landscaped public park in an american cityb new york city played a complex role in the american civil war the citys strong commercial ties to the american south 64 its growing immigrant population prior to then largely from germany and ireland beginning in the late 1850s waves of italian and central and eastern european jews began flowing in en-masse anger about conscription sizzled and resentment at those who could afford to pay $300 to avoid service led to resentment against lincolns war policies plus the racial element fomented paranoia about free blacks taking the poor immigrants jobs 65 culminated in the three-day-long new york draft riots of july 1863 these intense war-time riots are counted among the worst incidents of civil disorder in american history with an estimated 119 participants and passersby massacred 66 the rate of immigration from europe grew steeply after the civil war and new york became the first stop for millions seeking a new life in the united states a role acknowledged by the dedication of the statue of liberty on october 28 1886 a gift from the people of france 67 68 the new european immigration brought further social upheaval in a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations the city was a hotbed of revolution including anarchists and communists among others syndicalism racketeering and unionization in 1883 the opening of the brooklyn bridge established a road connection to brooklyn across the east river in 1874 the western portion of the present bronx county was transferred to new york county from westchester county and in 1895 the remainder of the present bronx county was annexed 69 in 1898 when new york city consolidated with three neighboring counties to form the city of greater new york manhattan and the bronx though still one county were established as two separate boroughs on january 1 1914 the new york state legislature created bronx county and new york county was reduced to its present boundaries 70 20th centuryedit the construction of the new york city subway which opened in 1904 helped bind the new city together as did additional bridges to brooklyn in the 1920s manhattan experienced large arrivals of african-americans as part of the great migration from the southern united states and the harlem renaissance part of a larger boom time in the prohibition era that included new skyscrapers competing for the skyline new york city became the most populous city in the world in 1925 overtaking london which had reigned for a century 71 manhattans majority white ethnic group declined from 98.7 in 1900 to 58.3 by 1990 72 on march 25 1911 the triangle shirtwaist factory fire in greenwich village killed 146 garment workers the disaster eventually led to overhauls of the citys fire department building codes and workplace regulations 73 the period between the world wars saw the election of reformist mayor fiorello la guardia and the fall of tammany hall after 80 years of political dominance 74 as the citys demographics stabilized labor unionization brought new protections and affluence to the working class the citys government and infrastructure underwent a dramatic overhaul under la guardia despite the great depression some of the worlds tallest skyscrapers were completed in manhattan during the 1930s including numerous art deco masterpieces that are still part of the citys skyline today most notably the empire state building the chrysler building and the ge building returning world war ii veterans created a postwar economic boom which led to the development of huge housing developments targeted at returning veterans the largest being peter cooper village-stuyvesant town which opened in 1947 75 in 1952 the un relocated from its first headquarters near queens to the east side of manhattan 76 the stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous violent demonstrations by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of june 28 1969 at the stonewall inn in the greenwich village neighborhood of lower manhattan they are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for lgbt rights in the united states 77 78 in the 1970s job losses due to industrial restructuring caused new york city including manhattan to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates 79 while a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the citys economic health in the 1980s new yorks crime rate continued to increase through the decade and into the beginning of the 1990s 80 the 1980s saw a rebirth of wall street and manhattan reclaimed its role at the center of the worldwide financial industry the 1980s also saw manhattan at the heart of the aids crisis with greenwich village at its epicenter the organizations gay mens health crisis gmhc and aids coalition to unleash power act up were founded to advocate on behalf of those stricken with the disease by the 1990s crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies improving economic opportunities gentrification and new residents both american transplants and new immigrants from asia and latin america murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008 and the crack epidemic and its associated drug-related violence came under greater control 81 the outflow of population turned around as the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world joining with low interest rates and wall street bonuses to fuel the growth of the real estate market 82 important new sectors such as silicon alley emerged in manhattans economy 21st centuryedit on september 11 2001 two of four hijacked planes were flown into the twin towers of the original world trade center and the towers subsequently collapsed 7 world trade center collapsed due to fires and structural damage caused by heavy debris falling from the collapse of the twin towers the other buildings within the world trade center complex were damaged beyond repair and soon after demolished the collapse of the twin towers caused extensive damage to other surrounding buildings and skyscrapers in lower manhattan and resulted in the deaths of 2,606 people in addition to those on the planes since 2001 most of lower manhattan has been restored but there has been controversy surrounding the rebuilding however many rescue workers and residents of the area developed several life-threatening illnesses that have led to some of their subsequent deaths 85 a memorial at the site was opened to the public on september 11 2011 and the museum opened in 2014 in 2014 the new one world trade center at 1,776feet  541m and formerly known as the freedom tower became the tallest building in the western hemisphere 86 while other skyscrapers were under construction at the site the occupy wall street protests in zuccotti park in the financial district of lower manhattan began on september 17 2011 receiving global attention and spawning the occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide 87 on october 29 and 30 2012 hurricane sandy caused extensive destruction in the borough ravaging portions of lower manhattan with record-high storm surge from new york harbor 88 severe flooding and high winds causing power outages for hundreds of thousands of city residents 89 and leading to gasoline shortages 90 and disruption of mass transit systems 91 92 93 94 the storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the borough and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future 95 geographyedit componentsedit the borough consists of manhattan island marble hill and several small islands including randalls island and wards island and roosevelt island in the east river and governors island and liberty island to the south in new york harbor 96 according to the us census bureau new york county has a total area of 33.6 square miles  87km2 of which 22.8 square miles  59km2 is land and 10.8 square miles  28km2  32 is water 97 the northern segment of upper manhattan represents a geographic panhandle manhattan island is 22.7square miles  59km2 in area 13.4miles  21.6km long and 2.3miles  3.7km wide at its widest near 14th street 98 manhattan islandedit manhattan island is loosely divided into downtown lower manhattan midtown midtown manhattan and uptown upper manhattan with fifth avenue dividing manhattans east and west sides manhattan island is bounded by the hudson river to the west and the east river to the east to the north the harlem river divides manhattan island from the bronx and the mainland united states early in the 19th century landfill was used to expand lower manhattan from the natural hudson shoreline at greenwich street to west street 99 when building the world trade center in 1968 1.2million cubic yards  917,000m of material was excavated from the site 100 rather than dumping the spoil at sea or in landfills the fill material was used to expand the manhattan shoreline across west street creating battery park city 101 the result was a 700-foot  210-m extension into the river running six blocks or 1,484 feet  452m covering 92acres  37ha providing a 1.2-mile  1.9km riverfront esplanade and over 30acres  12ha of parks 102 marble hilledit one neighborhood of new york county is contiguous with the mainland marble hill at one time was part of manhattan island but the harlem river ship canal dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the harlem river separated it from the remainder of manhattan as an island between the bronx and the remainder of manhattan 103 before world war i the section of the original harlem river channel separating marble hill from the bronx was filled in and marble hill became part of the mainland 104 marble hill is one example of how manhattans land has been considerably altered by human intervention the borough has seen substantial land reclamation along its waterfronts since dutch colonial times and much of the natural variation in its topography has been evened out 34 smaller islandsedit in new york harbor there are three smaller islands ellis island shared with new jersey governors island liberty island other smaller islands in the east river include from north to south randalls and wards islands joined by landfill mill rock roosevelt island u thant island legally belmont island geologyedit bedrockedit the bedrock underlying much of manhattan is a mica schist known as manhattan schist 105 it is a strong competent metamorphic rock created when pangaea formed it is well suited for the foundations of tall buildings in central park outcrops of manhattan schist occur and rat rock is one rather large example 106 107 108 geologically a predominant feature of the substrata of manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near midtown manhattan dips down lower between 29th street and canal street then rises toward the surface again in lower manhattan it has been widely believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the midtown and financial district areas and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas 109 110 however research has shown that economic factors played a bigger part in the locations of these skyscrapers 111 112 113 updated seismic analysisedit according to the united states geological survey an updated analysis of seismic hazard in july 2014 revealed a slightly lower hazard for tall buildings in manhattan than previously assessed scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near new york city which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city 114 locationsedit adjacent countiesedit bergen county new jersey  west and northwest hudson county new jersey  west and southwest the bronx

are geographical the upper east side or ethnically descriptive little italy others are acronyms such as tribeca for triangle below canal street or soho south of houston or the far more recent vintages nolita north of little italy 115 116 and nomad north of madison square park 117 118 119 harlem is a name from the dutch colonial era after haarlem a city in the netherlands 120 alphabet city comprises avenues a b c and d to which its name refers some have simple folkloric names such as hells kitchen alongside their more official but lesser used title in this case clinton some neighborhoods such as soho are commercial and known for upscale shopping others such as greenwich village the lower east side alphabet city and the east village have long been associated with the bohemian subculture 121 chelsea is a neighborhood with a large gay population and recently a center of new yorks art industry and nightlife 122 washington heights is a vibrant neighborhood of immigrants from the dominican republic chinatown has a dense population of people of chinese descent 123 124 koreatown is roughly bounded by 5th and 6th avenues between 31st and 36th streets rose hill features a growing number of indian restaurants and spice shops along a stretch of lexington avenue between 25th and 30th streets which has become known as curry hill 125 in manhattan uptown means north more precisely north-northeast which is the direction the island and its street grid system are oriented and downtown means south south-southwest 126 this usage differs from that of most american cities where downtown refers to the central business district manhattan has two central business districts the financial district at the southern tip of the island and midtown manhattan the term uptown also refers to the northern part of manhattan above 72nd street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th street 127 with midtown covering the area in between though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation fifth avenue roughly bisects manhattan island and acts as the demarcation line for eastwest designations eg east 27th street west 42nd street street addresses start at fifth avenue and increase heading away from fifth avenue at a rate of 100 per block on most streets 127 south of waverly place fifth avenue terminates and broadway becomes the eastwest demarcation line though the grid does start with 1st street just north of houston street the southernmost street divided in west and east portions pronounced how-stin the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th street where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified which increase from south to north to 220th street the highest numbered street on the island streets in midtown are usually one way with a few exceptions  14th 23rd 34th and 42nd for example the rule of thumb is that odd-numbered streets run west while even-numbered streets run east 98 climateedit under the köppen climate classification using the 0c  32f coldest month january isotherm new york city including manhattan itself experiences a humid subtropical climate cfa 128 129 and located at around 40n latitude is the northernmost major city on the north american continent with this categorization winters are cold and damp and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the moderating effects of the atlantic ocean yet the atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the appalachians keep the city warmer in the winter than inland north american cities at similar or lesser latitudes such as pittsburgh cincinnati and indianapolis helping to moderate the amount of snow which averages 25 inches  64cm each year 130 spring and fall in new york city are mild while summer is very warm and humid with temperatures of 90f  32c or higher recorded from 18 to 25 days on average during the season 131 the citys long-term climate patterns are affected by the atlantic multidecadal oscillation a

offices and agencies maintain locations in that area crime and public safetyedit starting in the mid-19th century the united states became a magnet for immigrants seeking to escape poverty in their home countries after arriving in new york many new arrivals ended up living in squalor in the slums of the five points neighborhood an area between broadway and the bowery northeast of new york city hall by the 1820s the area was home to many gambling dens and brothels and was known as a dangerous place to go in 1842 charles dickens visited the area and was appalled at the horrendous living conditions he had seen 271 the area was so notorious that it even caught the attention of abraham lincoln who visited the area before his cooper union speech in 1860 272 the predominantly irish five points gang was one of the countrys first major organized crime entities as italian immigration grew in the early 20th century many joined ethnic gangs including al capone who got his start in crime with the five points gang 273 the mafia also known as cosa nostra first developed in the mid-19th century in sicily and spread to the east coast of the united states during the late 19th century following waves of sicilian and southern italian emigration lucky luciano established cosa nostra in manhattan forming alliances with other criminal enterprises including the jewish mob led by meyer lansky the leading jewish gangster of that period 274 from 1920–1933 prohibition helped create a thriving black market in liquor upon which the mafia was quick to capitalize 274 as in the whole of new york city manhattan experienced a sharp increase in crime during the 1960s and 1970s 275 since 1990 crime in manhattan has plummeted in all categories tracked by the compstat profile a borough that saw 503 murders in 1990 has seen a drop of nearly 88 to 62 in 2008 robbery and burglary are down by more than 80 during the period and auto theft has been reduced by more than 93 in the seven major crime categories tracked by the system overall crime has declined by more than 75 since 1990 and year-to-date statistics through may 2009 show continuing declines 276 based on 2005 data new york city has the lowest crime rate among the ten largest cities in the united states 277 housingedit during manhattans early history wood construction and poor access to water supplies left the city vulnerable to fires in 1776 shortly after the continental army evacuated manhattan and left it to the british a massive fire broke out destroying one-third of the city and some 500 houses 278 the rise of immigration near the turn of the 20th century left major portions of manhattan especially the lower east side densely packed with recent arrivals crammed into unhealthy and unsanitary housing tenements were usually five-stories high constructed on the then-typical 25x100 lots with cockroach landlords exploiting the new immigrants 279 280 by 1929 stricter fire codes and the increased use of elevators in residential buildings were the impetus behind a new housing code that effectively ended the tenement as a form of new construction though many tenement buildings survive today on the east side of the borough 280 manhattan offers a wide array of public and private housing options there were 852,575 housing units in 2013 1 at an average density of 37,345 per square mile  14,419km as of 2003update only 20.3 of manhattan residents lived in owner-occupied housing the second-lowest rate of all counties in the nation behind the bronx 281 although the city of new york has the highest average cost for rent in the united states it simultaneously hosts a higher average of income per capita because of this rent is a lower percentage of annual income than in several other american cities 282 as of 2012update manhattans real estate market for luxury housing was among the most expensive in the world 283 infrastructureedit transportationedit public transportationedit manhattan is unique in the us for intense use of public transportation and lack of private car ownership while 88 of americans nationwide drive to their jobs with only 5 using public transport mass transit is the dominant form of travel for residents of manhattan with 72 of borough residents using public transport to get to work while only 18 drove 284 285 according to the 2000 united states census 77.5 of manhattan households do not own a car 286 in 2008 mayor bloomberg proposed a congestion pricing system to regulate entering manhattan south of 60th street the state legislature rejected the proposal in june 2008 287 the new york city subway the largest subway system in the world by number of stations is the primary means of travel within the city linking every borough except staten island there are 148 subway stations in manhattan and four under construction out of the 469 stations a second subway the port authority trans-hudson path system connects six stations in manhattan to northern new jersey passengers pay fares with pay-per-ride metrocards which are valid on all city buses and subways as well as on path trains 288 289 there are 7-day and 30-day metrocards that allow unlimited trips on all subways except path and mta bus routes except for express buses 290 the path quickcard is being phased out having been replaced by the smartlink the mta is testing smart card payment systems to replace the metrocard 291 commuter rail services operating to and from manhattan are the long island rail road which connects manhattan and other new york city boroughs to long island the metro-north railroad which connects manhattan to upstate new york and southwestern connecticut and nj transit trains to various points in new jersey multibillion-dollar heavy-rail transit projects under construction in manhattan include the second avenue subway the east side access project and the world trade center transportation hub 292 two multi-billion-dollar projects were completed in the mid-2010s with the $1.4 billion fulton center having been completed in november 2014 293 and the $2.4 billion 7 subway extension having been completed in september 2015 294 mta new york city transit offers a wide variety of local buses within manhattan under the brand new york city bus an extensive network of express bus routes serves commuters and other travelers heading into manhattan the bus system served 784 million passengers citywide in 2011 placing the bus systems ridership as the highest in the nation and more than double the ridership of the second-place los angeles system 295 the roosevelt island tramway one of two commuter cable car systems in north america whisks commuters between roosevelt island and manhattan in less than five minutes and has been serving the island since 1978 the other system in north america is the portland aerial tram 296 297 the staten island ferry which runs 24 hours a day 365 days a year annually carries over 21 million passengers on the 5.2-mile  8.4km run between manhattan and staten island each weekday five vessels transport about 65,000 passengers on 109 boat trips 298 299 the ferry has been fare-free since 1997 when the then-50-cent fare was eliminated 300 the metro regions commuter rail lines converge at penn station and grand central terminal on the west and east sides of midtown manhattan respectively they are the two busiest rail stations in the united states about one-third of users of mass transit and two-thirds of railway passengers in the country live in new york and its suburbs 301 amtrak provides inter-city passenger rail service from penn station to boston philadelphia baltimore and washington dc upstate new york and new england cross-canadian border service to toronto and montreal and destinations in the southern and midwestern united states taxisedit new yorks iconic yellow taxicabs which number 13,087 city-wide and must have the requisite medallion authorizing the pick up of street hails are ubiquitous in the borough 302 various private transportation network companies compete in manhattan with each other and with the citys taxicabs bikesedit manhattan also has tens of thousands of bicycle commuters streets and roadsedit the commissioners plan of 1811 called for twelve numbered avenues running north and south roughly parallel to the shore of the hudson river each 100feet  30m wide with first avenue on the east side and twelfth avenue on the west side there are several intermittent avenues east of first avenue including four additional lettered avenues running from avenue a eastward to avenue d in an area now known as alphabet city in manhattans east village the numbered streets in manhattan run east-west and are generally 60feet  18m wide with about 200feet  61m between each pair of streets with each combined street and block adding up to about 260 feet  79m there are almost exactly 20blocks per mile the typical block in manhattan is 250 by 600 feet  76 by 183m according to the original commissioners plan there were 155 numbered crosstown streets 303 but later the grid was extended up to the northernmost corner of manhattan where the last numbered street is 220th street manhattan moreover the numbering system continues even in the bronx north of manhattan despite the fact that the grid plan is not so regular there and the last numbered street is 263rd street 304 fifteen crosstown streets were designated as 100 feet  30m wide including 34th 42nd 57th and 125th streets 305 which became some of the boroughs most significant transportation and shopping venues broadway is the most notable of many exceptions to the grid starting at bowling green in lower manhattan and continuing north into the bronx at manhattans northern tip in much of midtown manhattan broadway runs at a diagonal to the grid creating major named intersections at union square park avenue southfourth avenue and 14th street madison square fifth avenue and 23rd street herald square sixth avenue and 34th street times square seventh avenue and 42nd street and columbus circle eighth avenuecentral park west and 59th street crosstown traffic refers primarily to vehicular traffic between manhattans east side and manhattans west side the trip is notoriously frustrating for drivers because of heavy congestion on narrow local streets laid out by the commissioners plan of 1811 absence of express roads other than the trans-manhattan expressway at the far north end of manhattan island and only 4 crosstown roads for travel through central park which is between 59th street and 110th street proposals in the mid-1900s to build express roads through the citys densest neighborhoods namely the mid-manhattan expressway and lower manhattan expressway did not go forward the congestion makes manhattans crosstown buses the perennial winners of the pokey awards for slowest service in new york city another consequence of the strict grid plan of most of manhattan and the grids skew of approximately 28.9degrees is a phenomenon sometimes referred to as manhattanhenge by analogy with stonehenge 306 on separate occasions in late may and early july the sunset is aligned with the street grid lines with the result that the sun is visible at or near the western horizon from street level 306 307 a similar phenomenon occurs with the sunrise in january and december the fdr drive and harlem river drive both designed by controversial new york master planner robert moses 308 comprise a single long limited-access parkway skirting the east side of manhattan along the east river and harlem river south of dyckman street the henry hudson parkway is the corresponding parkway on the west side north of 57th street river crossingsedit being primarily an island manhattan is

known officially as the robert f kennedy bridge ed koch queensboro also known as the 59th street bridge williamsburg manhattan and brooklyn bridgesconnect manhattan to long island several tunnels also link manhattan island to new york citys outer boroughs and new jersey the lincoln tunnel which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the hudson river between new jersey and midtown manhattan is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world 311 the tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sail through new york harbor and up the hudson river to manhattans piers the holland tunnel connecting lower manhattan to jersey city new jersey was the worlds first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel 312 the queens-midtown tunnel built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting manhattan with queens and brooklyn was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940 313 president franklin d roosevelt was the first person to drive through it 314 the brooklynbattery tunnel runs underneath battery park and connects the financial district at the southern tip of manhattan to red hook in brooklyn heliportsedit manhattan has three public heliports the east 34th street heliport also known as the atlantic metroport at east 34th street owned by new york city and run by the new york city economic development

317 con edison operates the worlds largest district steam system which consists of 105miles  169km of steam pipes providing steam for heating hot water and air conditioning 318 by some 1,800 manhattan customers 319 cable service is provided by time warner cable and telephone service is provided by verizon communications although att is available as well manhattan surrounded by two brackish rivers had a limited supply of fresh water to satisfy the growing population the city of new york acquired land in westchester county and constructed the old croton aqueduct system which went into service in 1842 and was superseded by the new croton aqueduct which opened in 1890 but this was interrupted in 2008 for the construction since underway of a us$3.2 billion water purification plant that can supply an estimated 290 million gallons daily when completed representing almost a 20 addition to the citys availability of water with this addition going to manhattan and the bronx 320 water comes to manhattan through new york city water tunnel no 1 tunnel no 2 and tunnel no 3 completed in 1917 1936 and manhattans supply 2013 321 respectively manhattan witnessed the doubling of the natural gas supply delivered to the borough when a new gas pipeline opened on november 1 2013 322 the new york city department of sanitation is responsible for garbage removal 323 the bulk of the citys trash ultimately is disposed at mega-dumps in pennsylvania virginia south carolina and ohio via transfer stations in new jersey brooklyn and queens since the 2001 closure of the fresh kills landfill on staten island 324 a small amount of trash processed at transfer sites in new jersey is sometimes incinerated at waste-to-energy facilities like new york city new jersey and much of greater new york
