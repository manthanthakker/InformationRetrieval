renewable energy in the philippines renewable energy accounted for 26.44 of the philippines total electrical energy needs in 2013 in terms of gigawatt-hours renewable energy sources provided the philippines with 19,903 gigawatt-hours of electrical energy out of a total need of 75,266 gigawatt-hours in 2013 1 in the philippines five main types of renewable energy are used these are hydropower geothermal power wind power solar power and biomass power in recent years there has been a drive to increase the philippines usage of renewable energy sources reasons include the disadvantages of using fossil fuels such as pollution accelerated climate change and fluctuating prices 2 3 the philippine government has responded to the increased demand for renewable energy by enacting certain laws in 2001 the philippine congress enacted the electric power industry reform act which promotes the use of local and sustainable energy sources as opposed to imported fossil fuel sources 4 in 2006 congress passed the biofuels act which promotes the use of biomass fuels 5 in 2008 the renewable energy act 6 was passed which further encouraged the development and usage of renewable energy in the philippines 7 in 2009 the climate change act was passed which provided a legal basis for the tackling of climate change through sustainable development 8 the laws enacted by congress has resulted in a significant degree of cooperation from private companies producing renewable energy hundreds of whom have contracts with the philippine government  contents 1 rationale for renewable energy in the

considered important in the philippines for several reasons 9 given its geographic characteristics the philippines is highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change rising sea levels are a threat to the philippines as it is an archipelago with many cities located near coastal areas as the coastline recedes due to rising seas coastal cities in the country will become more vulnerable to flooding in the long run rising sea levels may even make these cities uninhabitable climate change has also been linked to altered weather patterns and extreme weather events 10 the continued reliance on fossil fuels is also detrimental to the governments goal to maintain energy security which pertains to the countrys ability to readily and affordably procure energy resources 11 the philippines does not have a sizeable domestic production of oil and coal and so it is a net importer of both these fossil fuels in 2012 the philippines imported 20 million tons of coal to generate energy but only domestically supplied 8 million tons 12 likewise the philippines needed 54 million barrels of oil in 2010 but only domestically produced 33,000 barrels 13 given its heavy dependence on imported coal and oil the philippines is more vulnerable to power shortages caused by price fluctuations and supply constraints affecting these commodities 3 this in turn can lead to higher energy prices for consumers as well as the possibility of energy rationing in certain areas fossil fuels are also an unsuitable long-term energy source because rapidly depleting coal oil and natural gas stocks in the succeeding decades it is predicted that diminishing fossil fuel reserves will result in supply constraints that appreciably drive up coal oil and natural gas prices thus the costs associated with procuring and using fossil fuel are expected to rise it is also predicted that nearly all economically recoverable sources of fossil fuels will be fully depleted before the end of the 21st century 14 given the disadvantages of using fossil fuels to meet the philippines energy needs there have been movements to promote the wider use of renewable energy the main drivers behind this are the desire to use cleaner and more secure energy sources this is reflected in a statement released by the philippine department of energy the harnessing and utilization of renewable energy comprises a critical component of the governments strategy to provide energy supply for the country this is evident in the power sector where increased generation from geothermal and hydro resources has lessened the countrys dependency on imported and polluting fuels in the governments rural electrification efforts on the other hand renewable energy sources such as solar micro-hydro wind and biomass resources are seeing wide-scale use 15 renewable electricity overviewedit despite its heavy reliance on fossil fuels for energy the philippines does utilize renewable sources of energy in its current energy mix in particular the philippines utilizes hydropower geothermal solar wind and biomass resources together these renewable energy sources contributed 19,903 gwh of electrical energy in 2013 or 26.44 of the countrys power needs 1 sourcesedit hydropoweredit hydroelectric plants in the philippines are evenly split between conventional dam hydro and run-of-the-river out of 29 hydropower sites in the country 14 use dams while 15 use run-of-the-river 17 18 19 an advantage of hydropower in the country is that it can be implemented in almost every region according to the department of energy potential sites for mini and micro-hydro projects are evenly distributed in all the regions 20 this makes hydropower more suitable for nationwide implementation than other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind hydropower can cause flooding in upstream areas thereby damaging or destroying the homes and crops of local residents 20 this is especially true during the rainy season in the philippines where dams are forced to release water or risk overflowing oftentimes releasing water during these times further harms residents and farmers already severely impacted by the inclement weather 21 geothermal poweredit geothermal energy is derived from the heat found beneath the earths surface 22 in general geothermal energy is derived from the pockets of heated water and rock that lie beneath the earths surface in temperate countries geothermal energy is used directly to provide heating for homes 23 however such an application is not used in the philippines and for the most part geothermal energy is used to generate electrical energy two technologies are used in the philippines the higher temperature flash steam method and the somewhat lower temperature binary cycle method 24 almost all of the philippines 11 geothermal power plants use the flash steam method the only exception is the makban plant which is a flash steam-binary process hybrid geothermal energy is a renewable energy source without large green-house gas emissions and is widely available in the philippines geothermal plants can be opened in areas with low wind incidence such as mindanao and areas that frequently experience rainy weather such as batanes thus geothermal plants can be used to serve areas that cannot be serviced by other renewable energy sources however the process of extracting geothermal energy sometimes releases toxic substances from beneath the earths surface such substances include mercury hydrogen sulfide arsenic and selenium 25 there have been instances of human poisoning that have been linked back to geothermal plants in the philippines one of the most known events happened at a geothermal plant in biliran where eight plant workers were hospitalized because of hydrogen sulfide poisoning 26 solar poweredit although located in a region that receives high amounts of sunlight the philippines does not utilize solar energy on the same scale as it does hydropower and geothermal power however the country has opened an increasing number of solar farms in recent years in 2015 alone three large solar farms were opened within the country solar energy resources are large in the philippines thanks to the countrys position near the equator the philippines receives 5.1 kwh per square meter per day on average given the high amount of incident sunlight received by the country a significant amount of energy can be derived by solar farms operating in highly sunny areas solar energy systems are also more easily installed in remote areas especially rural areas where it can be expensive to extend the power grid adverse weather conditions such as during rainy and cloudy weather somewhat limit the available solar resources as the country has an average of 144 rainy days per year 27 wind poweredit all wind power sites in the philippines are on-shore facilities besides generating power wind farms such as those in ilocos norte are locally known as tourist sites 28 29 thousands of visitors have visited the bangui wind farm ever since its opening in 2005 during the lenten break in 2016 over 61,000 tourists came to see the wind turbines at bangui 28 a similar trend is seen in wind farms outside ilocos as tourists are also known to flock at the pililia wind farm in rizal 29 biomass poweredit biomass energy refers to energy derived from plant and animal sources 30 biomass resources are abundant in the philippines being an agricultural country the philippines is rich in sources of biomass energy at present bagasse rice husks and coconut husks are used in the country to generate power 31 according to the department of energy regions iii iv vi and vii are abundant in bagasse coconut husks are abundant in regions iv viii ix and xi meanwhile regions ii iii iv and vi are rich in rice hulls because of the abundance of these materials in the country biomass fuel sources are a cheaper source of energy than imported fossil fuels to a lesser extent the philippines also uses landfill gas as a biomass energy source the primary disadvantage of biomass energy use in the philippines is that its availability is tied to the plant and animal sources they are derived from 32 if the country experiences an event such as a drought that cuts rice sugar or coconut production the production of biomass energy can be expected to fall government supportedit the philippine government has passed four laws that seek to improve the state of renewable energy in the philippines the electric power industry reform act of 2001 ra 9136 the biofuel act of 2006 ra 9367 the renewable energy act of 2008 ra 9513 and the climate change act of 2009 ra 9729 the philippine department of energy doe was lead agency mandated to implement the provisions of the former three laws republic act 9136edit republic act 9136 or the electric power industry reform act of 2001 epira declared that it is the policy of the state to promote the utilization of indigenous and new and renewable energy resources in power generation in order to reduce dependence on imported energy it stated that the doe shall encourage private sector investments in the electricity sector and promote development of renewable energy sources including small-scale renewable energy generating sources 4 moreover for government efforts of missionary electrification epira promoted the utilization of renewable energy resources whenever feasible providing power generation and its associated power delivery systems in areas that are not connected to the grid this act also set criteria for determining qualified third parties that may participate in providing electricity to remote and unviable areas giving preference to parties that would utilize least-cost renewable energy resources 4 republic act 9367edit republic act 9367 also known as the biofuels act of 2006 declared that it is the policy of the state to reduce dependence on imported fuels with due regard to the public health the environment and natural ecosystems by mandating the use of biofuels wherein one aim is the availability of alternative and renewable clean energy without any detriment to the ecosystem and food reserves of the country it encourages investments in biofuels with the following incentives specific tax on local or imported biofuels component the sale of raw material used in the production of biofuels shall be exempt from the value added tax moreover government financial institutions such as the development bank of the philippines land bank of the philippines quedancor and other government institutions providing financial services shall extend financing to filipino citizens or entities that shall engage in activities involving production biofuel feed-stock as certified by the doe finally the law saw the creation of the national biofuel board nbb which would monitor the implementation of and evaluate for further expansion the national biofuel program nbp prepared by the doe 5 republic act 9513edit republic act 9513 also called the renewable energy act of 2008 pushed for the wider use of renewable energy in the philippines in particular the law called for the state to a accelerate the exploration and development of renewable energy re resources such as but not limited to biomass solar wind hydro geothermal and ocean energy sources b increase the utilization of renewable energy by institutionalizing the development of national and local capabilities in the use of re systems and promoting its efficient and cost-effective commercial application by providing fiscal and non-fiscal incentives c encourage re resources as tools to effectively prevent or reduce harmful emissions for the protection of health and the environment and d establish the necessary infrastructure and mechanism to carry out the mandates specified in this act and other existing laws 7 on-grid renewable energy developmentedit under section 6 of ra 9513 a renewable portfolio standard rps was made to set a minimum percentage of generation from eligible renewable energy resources and determine to which sector rps shall be imposed on a per grid basis under section 7 of ra 9513 a feed-in tariff system was implemented for electricity produced from wind solar ocean run-of-river hydropower and biomass fit encourages re capacity by guaranteeing prices in the form of long-term contracts to re producers typically based on the cost of generation of each technology 33 under the fit system qualified developers of emerging re sources are offered on a fixed rate per kilowatt-hour kwh of their exported electricity to the distribution or transmission network this scheme excludes the energy utilized from re plants eligible for own use fit is one of the policy mechanisms eyed by the doe as it aims to maintain the share of re to at least 30 in the countrys power mix the doe highlights that fit subscriptions for re resources has significantly increased to 806.82 mw from 646.65 mw installations since the start of 2016 under section 10 of ra 9513 net-metering for renewable energy was promoted by having the distribution utilities enter into net-metering agreements with qualified end-users of re systems off-grid renewable energy developmentedit under section 12 of ra 9513 npc-spug in charge of providing missionary electrification was ordered to source a minimum percentage of its total annual generation from available re resources in the area concerned incentivesedit under section 15 of ra 9513 developers of renewable energy facilities duly certified by the doe are entitled to many incentives particularly an income tax holiday for the first seven  7 years of its commercial operations duty-free importation of renewable energy machinery equipment and materials within the first ten  10 years upon the issuance of certification under certain provisions special realty tax rates on renewable energy equipment and machinery net operating loss carry-over zero percent value-added tax vat rate for the sale of fuel or power generated from renewable sources of energy and tax credit on domestic capital equipment and services under section 21 of ra 9513 the renewable energy sector was declared a priority investment sector that will regularly form part of the countrys investment priority plan doe-accredited manufacturers fabricators and suppliers of locally produced renewable energy equipment and components are entitled to tax and duty-free importation of materials tax credit on domestic capital materials income tax holiday and exemption for seven  7 years and zero-rated vat transactions under section 22 of ra 9513 doe-certified individuals and entities ie farmers engaged in the plantation of crops and trees used as biomass resources are entitled to duty-free importation and be exempted from value-added tax vat on all types of agricultural inputs equipment and machinery for a period of ten  10 years after the effectiveness of the act provisionsedit under chapter 8 of ra 9513 the national renewable energy board nreb was created to evaluate and recommend the mandated rfs and minimum re generation capacities for off-grid areas to monitor and recommend specific actions for implementing the national renewable energy program nrep and other such functions to attain the objectives of the act and the renewable energy management bureau was created for the purpose of implementing the provisions in the act the renewable energy trust fund overseen by the nreb was also established for financing the enhancement of development and greater utilization of renewable energy republic act 9729edit republic act 9729 also known as the climate change act of 2009 stated that it is the policy of the state to afford full protection and the advancement of the right of the people to a healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature it is to make it a policy of the state to incorporate a gender-sensitive pro-children and pro-poor perspective in all climate change and renewable energy efforts plans and programs the state aims to strengthen integrate consolidate and institutionalize government initiatives to achieve coordination in the implementation of plans and programs to address climate change in the context of sustainable development 8 issues with implementationedit despite the enactment of the renewable energy act in 2008 new investments in renewable energy have reportedly been slow on the uptake the fit were approved only in 2012 and thus far there have been two investments in solar facilities that are expected to be operational in 2016 the four-year span in the approval of the fit delayed a potential investment of $2.5 billion compared with the original fit tariffs filed by the national renewable energy board nreb before the energy regulatory commission in april 2011 the approved rates in july 2012 are much lower in 2015 the regulators are looking at even lower fit tariff levels for the next batch of fit applicants 33 feed-in tariff program statisticsedit involvement of the private sectoredit republic act 9531 or the renewable energy act of 2008 encourages the involvement of the private sector in renewable energy given that there is an increasing shift towards clean and sustainable energy 35 the renewable energy act of 2008 seeks to attract members of the private sector to contribute to the development of renewable energy in the country by offering fiscal and non-fiscal incentives fiscal incentives include tax breaks as well as funding assistance from both the government and third parties a number of international organizations have expressed willingness to aid philippine businesses in developing local renewable energy infrastructure such organizations include german technical cooperation gtz united states agency for international development usaid asian development bank adb united nations development programme undp and japan international cooperation agency jica 36 barriers to private sector participationedit however there are factors that makes their involvement challenging or that may hinder potential actors from entering the industry in the first place such barriers include high transaction costs social engineering costs need for political connections lack of local technologyexpertise and government price ceilings on energy prices derived from renewable energy sources high transaction costsedit many private sector businesses are facing high transaction costs due to bureaucratic inefficiency and procedural delays for instance many private sector players face troubles due delays in the issuance of standard documents which are caused by intra-governmental conflict such delays are problematic on the side of the private sector actors as they face increasing transaction and labor costs as time draws on social engineering costsedit in addition to the previously mentioned transition costs private sector players also face social engineering costs this type of cost involves certain indigenous groups and non-governmental organizations in which they engage in informal forms of harassment such as public information threats mobilization of protests and the slander of corporate reputation in exchange for financial concessions these can reach up to approximately us$20 million which are distributed among the different types of government officials 37 lack of local technologyedit many renewable energy sources such as wind power and solar power require specialized equipment that are not produced in the philippines because of this many private sector players involved in renewable energy must import needed equipment and tools from other countries before they can begin operations in the country since doing this can prove to be prohibitively expensive many private firms choose not to get into renewable energy in the philippines 37 price ceilings on electricity ratesedit due to the high costs associated with investing in renewable energy infrastructure private sector firms try to recoup their investment through higher rates however certain government agencies such as the energy regulatory commission erc impose lower generation rates on power producers in order to safeguard consumer interests because imposed rates are significantly lower than the proposed rates submitted by renewable energy producers many private firms are reluctant to enter the renewable energy sector because this could mean a long payback period and low profits if any at all 35 public-private partnershipedit public-private partnerships are a kind of contractual agreement between a government entity and private sector player wherein the private sector player provides a public asset or service with the governments support 38 in public-private partnerships the government benefits by tapping into the expertise of the private actor who can provide assets and services to the public more efficiently the government also benefits by offloading some investment cost onto the private partner in exchange for taking on the risk of providing a public asset or service the private partner gets to benefit economically from the public-private partnership as of june 2015 the department of energy doe has awarded 646 service contracts to private sector players under the renewable energy law with installed capacity of 2,760.52 mw 39 the doe posts updates of its private sector initiated power projectsboth committed and indicative of all types of power sources and of all regionsevery month in its official website 40 listed below are the current committed private sector initiated power projects that involve renewable energy off grid project see alsoedit wind power in the philippines
