renewable energy in australia renewable energy in australia deals with efforts being made in australia to quantify and expand renewable energy which includes electricity transport fuels and thermal energy total renewable energy consumption in australia in 2015 was 346pj representing 5.9 of australias total energy consumption 1 this is an increase of 1.6 from 2011–12 levels  265pj representing 4.3 of australias total energy consumption 2 of all renewable energy consumption in 2015 in order of contribution biomass wood woodwaste and bagasse represents 53 hydroelectricity 19.2 wind 10.7 solar pv 5.1 biogas 4.7 solar hot water 3.8 and biofuels 3.6 3 bioenergy the sum of all energy derived from plant matter represented 61.3  211.9pj of australias total renewable energy consumption in 2015 3 renewable electricity has undergone substantial growth in australia in the 21st century it is estimated that australia produced 35,007 gigawatt hours gwh of renewable electricity or equivalent over the year ending december 2015 representing 14.6 of the total production in australia 4 by way of comparison in 2006 approximately 9,500gwh of electricity came from renewable sources representing less than 4 of nationally generated electricity 5citation needed of all renewable electrical sources in 2012 hydroelectricity represented 57.8 wind 26 bioenergy 8.1 solar pv 8 large-scale solar 0.147 geothermal 0.002 and marine 0.001 additionally solar hot water heating was estimated to replace a further 2,422gwh of electrical generation 6 similar to many other countries development of renewable electricity in australia has been encouraged by government energy policy implemented in response to concerns about climate change energy independence and economic stimulus 7 a key policy that has been in place since 2001 to encourage large-scale renewable energy development is a mandatory renewable energy target which in 2010 was increased to 41,000gigawatt-hours of renewable generation from power stations this was subsequently reduced to 33,000 gigawatt-hours by the abbott government with the agreement of the labor opposition 8 alongside this there is the small-scale renewable energy scheme an uncapped scheme to support rooftop solar power and solar hot water 9 and several state schemes providing feed-in tariffs to encourage photovoltaics in 2012 these policies were supplemented by a carbon price and a 10billion-dollar fund to finance renewable energy projects 10 although these initiatives were later withdrawn by the federal government 11 it has been suggested that with sufficient public and private sector investment and government policy certainty australia could switch entirely to renewable energy within a decade by building additional large-scale solar and wind power developments

therefore the transition to a renewable energy system is gaining momentum in the peer-reviewed scientific literature among them several studies have examined the feasibility of a transition to a 100 renewable electricity systems which was found both practicable as well as economically and environmentally beneficial to combat global warming 14 15 16 hydro poweredit the snowy mountains scheme constructed between 1949 and 1974 consists of sixteen major dams and seven major power stations and has a total generating capacity of 3,800mw the scheme generates on average 4,500 gwh electricity per year 17 hydro tasmania operates thirty power stations and fifty dams and has a total generating capacity of 2,600mw each year an average of 9,000 gwh of hydro-electricity is generated by the company 18 in 2007–08 hydro-electricity represented 15 of renewable energy production in australia 19 in 2015 this had risen to 40 of renewable energy production 4 wind poweredit as of october 2010 around 22.9 of australias renewable electricity and 2 of australias total electricity was sourced from wind power 20 enough electricity to power more than 700,000 homes 21 this came from 52 operating wind farms containing a total of 1,052turbines producing approximately 5,000gwh of electricity per year this figure represented approximately a 30 increase in wind power generation each year over the previous decade or a total increase of more than 1,000 over that time the total installed capacity as of october 2010 was 1,880mw including only projects over 100kw with a further 1,043mw under construction 21 wind power in south australia is a fast-growing industry as south australia is well suited for wind farms consequently more wind power is generated in south australia than any other australian state or territory as of october 2010 south australia had an installed capacity of 907mw from 435turbines accounting for close to 20 of that states electricity needs considerably ahead of victoria with 428mw from 267turbines and western australia with 202mw from 142turbines 21 by the end of 2011 wind power in south australia had risen to 26 of the states electricity generation edging out coal fired power for the first time with only 7.2 of australias population south australia had 54 of the nations installed wind power capacity 22 adelaides a2.2billion desalination plant capable of providing 50 of the citys water needs is totally powered by renewable energy the waubra wind farm near ballarat victoria completed in 2009 was the largest wind farm in the southern hemisphere 19 consisting of 128turbines spread over 173km2 21 and rated at 192mw however in terms of generating capacity lake bonney wind farm near millicent south australia was the largest with 239.5mw despite only having 99turbines these figures have since been surpassed by the macarthur wind farm at macarthur victoria which opened in 2013 with a capacity of 420mw 21 23 solaredit solar photovoltaicsedit solar photovoltaic pv technology generates electricity from sunlight and it can be used in grid-connected and off-grid applications they first become mass-produced in 2000 when german environmentalists and eurosolar succeeded in obtaining the government support for the 100,000 roofs program 24 the issue for the australian photovoltaics industry today is that there is enormous market potential built up through a natural competitiveness in australian research and development industry investment and government policy support however despite this the industry is not yet self-sustaining and advantages gained to date could be lost 25 a 2004 market report suggested that a partnership between government and industry is necessary the pv industry cannot continue to actively invest in strategic industry development unless the australian government is also committed to the journey the industry  requires policy and program support to assist it in bridging the gap to mainstream commercial competitiveness 25 two recent projects which illustrate co-operation between industry and government are the solar power station planned for north-western victoria and the development of new solar cells queensland solar and lighting is a major importer of chinese and european solar products for the brisbane region in queensland australia 26 mildura solar concentrator power stationedit many projects have demonstrated the feasibility of solar power in australia and a large new solar power station in victoria is planned solar systems is to build the worlds most advanced 27 photovoltaic pv heliostat solar concentrator power station in north-western victoria the 154mw a$420million project will generate 270,000mwh per year enough for more than 45,000 homes it will aid in reducing salinity and create jobs during manufacture construction and operation it will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 400,000tonnes per year 28 full commissioning is expected in 2013 with the first stage to be completed in 2010 29 the essential components of the power plant developed by solar systems over the past 16years are an ultra powerful solar module for use in concentrated sunlight a cooling system to keep solar cells operating at 60c to optimise the operation of the pv modules in a concentrated solar beam that can melt steel low cost high performance mirror concentrator systems a control system to manage the power station to deliver maximum reliability and output 29 the commercialisation of this technology has already seen four smaller solar power stations established in central australia with support from the australian greenhouse office 30 technology developmentedit sliver cell tm photovoltaic technology uses just one tenth of the costly and limited supply of silicon used in conventional solar panels while matching power performance and efficiency 31 professor andrew blakers director of the australian national university centre for sustainable energy systems invented the technology with colleague dr klaus weber and developed it with funding from energy supplier origin energy and the australian research council blakers and weber won the australian institute of physics walsh medal for their work 32 origin energy is presently developing sliver modules for commercialisation at its a$20m pilot plant in regency park south australia 33 solar thermal energyedit australia has developed world leading solar thermal technologies but with only very low levels of actual use domestic solar water heating is the most common solar thermal technology 34 solar water heatingedit during the 1950s australias commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro carried out world leading research into flat plate solar water heaters a solar water heater manufacturing industry was subsequently established in australia and a large proportion of the manufactured product was exported four of the original companies are still in business and the manufacturing base has now expanded to 24 companies despite an excellent solar resource the penetration of solar water heaters in the australian domestic market was only about 5 in 2006 with new dwellings accounting for most sales 35 by 2014 around 14 of australian households had solar hot water installed  36 it is estimated that by installing a solar hot water system it could reduce a familys co2 emissions up to 3tonnes per year while saving up to 80 of the energy costs for water heating 37 while solar water heating saves a significant amount of energy they are generally omitted from measures of renewable energy production as they do not actually produce electricity based on the installed base in australia as of october 2010 it was calculated that solar hot water units would account for about 7.4 of clean energy production if they were included in the overall figures 38 solar thermal poweredit csiros national solar energy centre in newcastle nsw houses a 500kw thermal and a 1.5 mw thermal solar central receiver system which are used as research and development facilities 39 40 the australian national university anu has worked on dish concentrator systems since the early 1970s and early work lead to the construction of the white cliffs solar thermal station in 1994 the first big dish 400m2 solar concentrator was completed on the anu campus in 2005 wizard power pty ltd was established to commercialise the big dish technology to deployment 41 wizard power has built and demonstrated the 500m2 commercial big dish design in canberra and the whyalla solaroasis 42 will be the first commercial implementation of the technology using 300 wizard power big dish solar thermal concentrators to deliver a 40mwe solar thermal power plant 43 construction is expected to commence in mid-late 2013 research activities at the university of sydney and university of new south wales have spun off into solar heat and power pty ltd now ausra which is currently building a major project at liddell power station in the hunter valley the csiro division of energy technology has opened a major solar energy centre in newcastle that has a tower system purchased from solar heat and power and a prototype trough concentrator array developed in collaboration with the anu 41 cloncurry a town in north-west queensland has been chosen as the site for an innovative $31million including a $7million government grant solar thermal power station the 10 mw solar thermal power station would deliver about 30million kilowatt hours of electricity a year enough to power the whole town ergon energy will develop the project which should be running by early 2010 44 45 in august 2008 worley parsons an australian engineering firm announced plans to build worlds biggest solar plant in australia within three years backed by nine australian companies including miners bhp billiton and rio tinto they have launched a study into finding possible sites to host the $1billion plant 46 solar citiesedit solar cities in australia is a $75million program which is designed to demonstrate how solar power smart meters energy conservation and new approaches to electricity pricing can combine to provide a sustainable energy future in urban locations throughout australia it is a partnership approach that involves all levels of government the private sector and the local community adelaide townsville blacktown and alice springs are the first four solar cities announced in australia 47 consumers will be able to purchase solar photovoltaic panels using discounted loans the project also plans to help low-income and rental households in the community share in the benefits of the project through other cost-saving initiatives 48 geothermal energyedit in australia geothermal energy is a natural resource which is not utilised as a form of energy however there are known and potential locations near the centre of the country in which geothermal activity is detectable exploratory geothermal wells have been drilled to test for the presence of high temperature geothermal activity and such high levels were detected as a result projects will eventuate in the coming years and more exploration is expected at potential locations south australia has been described as australias hot rock haven and this emissions free and renewable energy form could provide an estimated 6.8 of australias base load power needs by 2030 49 according to an estimate by the centre for international economics australia has enough geothermal energy to contribute electricity for 450years 50 there are currently 19 companies australia-wide spending a$654million in exploration programmes in 141 areas in south australia which is expected to dominate the sectors growth 12 companies have already applied for 116 areas and can be expected to invest a$524million us$435 m in their projects by the next six years ten projects are expected to achieve successful exploration and heat flows by 2010 with at least three power generation demonstration projects coming on stream by 2012 49 a geothermal power plant is generating 80kw of electricity at birdsville in southwest queensland 51 wave poweredit several projects for harvesting the power of the ocean are under development ocean power technologies australasia pty ltd is developing a 19mw wave power station connected to the grid near portland victoria the project has received an au$66.46million grant from the federal government of australia oceanlinx is trialling a wave energy system at port kembla carnegie corp of western australia is refining a method of using energy captured from passing waves ceto to generate high-pressure sea water this is piped onshore to drive a turbine and to create desalinated water a series of large buoys is tethered to piston pumps anchored in waters 15 to 50 metres  49 to 164ft deep the rise and fall of passing waves drives the pumps generating water pressures of up to 1,000pounds per square inch psi the company is looking to have a 50 mw demonstration project finished within the next four years biopower systems is developing its biowave system anchored to the seabed that would generate electricity through the movement of buoyant blades as waves pass in a swaying motion similar to the way sea plants such as kelp move it expects to complete pilot wave and tidal projects off northern tasmania this year 52 biofuelsedit biofuels produced from food crops have become controversial as food prices increased significantly in mid-2008 leading to increased concerns about food vs fuel ethanol fuel in australia can be produced from sugarcane or grains and there are currently three commercial producers of fuel ethanol in australia all on the east coast legislation imposes a 10 cap on the concentration of fuel ethanol blends blends of 90 unleaded petrol and 10 fuel ethanol are commonly referred to as e10 53 which is mainly available through service stations operating under the bp caltex shell and united brands in partnership with the queensland government the canegrowers organisation launched a regional billboard campaign in march 2007 to promote the renewable fuels industry over 100million litres of the new bp unleaded with renewable ethanol has now been sold to queensland motorists 53 biodiesel produced from oilseed crops or recycled cooking oil may be a better prospect than ethanol given the nations heavy reliance on road transport and the growing popularity of fuel-efficient diesel cars 54 australian cities are some of the most car-deponent cities in the world 55 and legislations involving vehicle pollution within the country are considered relatively lax 56 biomassedit biomass can be used directly for electricity generation for example by burning sugar cane waste bagasse as a fuel for thermal power generation in sugar mills it can also be used to produce steam for industrial uses cooking and heating it can also be converted into a liquid or gaseous biofuel 57 in 2015 bagasse accounted for 26.1  90.2pj of australias renewable energy consumption while wood and woodwaste for another 26.9  92.9pj 3 biomass for energy production was the subject of a federal government report in 2004 58 major renewable energy companiesedit bp solaredit bp has been involved in solar power since 1973 and its subsidiary bp solar is now one of the worlds largest solar power companies with production facilities in the united states spain india and australia 59 bp solar is involved in the commercialisation of a long life deep cycle lead acid battery jointly developed by the csiro and battery energy which is ideally suited to the storage of electricity for renewable remote area power systems raps 60 edwardsedit edwards first began manufacturing water heaters in australia in 1963 edwards is now an international organisation which is a leader in producing hot water systems for both domestic and commercial purposes using solar technology edwards exports to asia the pacific the americas europe africa and the middle east 61 eurosolaredit eurosolar was first formed in 1993 with an aim of providing photovoltaic systems to the masses it focuses on solar power in multiple australian capitals in cooperation with the clean energy council they continue to install panels all around australia origin energyedit origin energy is active in the renewable energy arena and has spent a number of years developing several wind farms in south australia a solar cell business using technology invented by a team led by professor andrew blakers at the australian national university 33 and geothermal power via a minority shareholding stake in geodynamics 62 pacific hydroedit pacific hydro is an australian company that specialises in electricity generation using renewable energy its focus is on hydroelectricity and wind power power stations owned by pacific hydro include wind farms codrington wind farm challicum hills wind farm portland wind project and hydro power eildon pondage power station ord river hydro power station and the drop hydro snowy hydro limitededit snowy hydro limited previously known as the snowy mountains hydro-electric authority manages the snowy mountains scheme which generates on average around 4500 gigawatt hours of renewable energy each year which represented around 74 of all renewable energy in the national electricity market in 2005 the scheme also diverts water for irrigation from the snowy river catchment west to the murray and murrumbidgee river systems solahartedit solahart manufactured its first solar water heater in 1953 and products currently manufactured by solahart include thermosiphon and split system solar and heat pump water heaters these are marketed in 90 countries around the world and overseas sales represent 40 of total business solahart has a market share of 50 in australia 63 solar systemsedit solar systems is a leader in high concentration solar photovoltaic applications 64 65 and the company is preparing to build the worlds largest photovoltaic mildura solar concentrator power station australia 66 67 this project will use innovative concentrator dish technology to power 45,000 homes providing 270,000 mwhyear for a$420million 68 solar systems has already completed construction of three concentrator dish power stations in the northern territory which together generate 1,555 mwhyear  260 homes going by the energyhome ratio above this represents a saving of 420,000litres of diesel fuel and 1550tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year the total cost of the solar power station was a$7m offset by a grant from the australian and northern territory governments under their renewable remote power generation program 69 for comparison 420,000litres of diesel at september 2009 prices of a$1.24litre 70 would cost $520,800 71 wind prospectedit wind prospect developed the 46 mw canunda wind farm in south australia which was commissioned in march 2005 a second south australian wind farm mount millar wind farm was commissioned in january 2006 and this provides a further 70 mw of generation more recently a third wind farm has reached financial close for wind prospect in south australia this is the 95 mw hallett wind farm which is expected to be fully commissioned late in 2008 government policyedit there are a number of government policies in place in australia that influence the development of renewable energy mandatory renewable energy target mret schemesedit a key policy encouraging the development of renewable energy in australia includes mandatory renewable energy target mret schemes at both commonwealth and state levels in 2001 the howard government introduced an mret of 9,500 gwh of new renewable energy generation by 2010 this target has since been revised with the gillard government introducing in january 2011 an expanded target of 45,000 gwh of additional renewable energy between 2001 and 2020 72 this mret has been split into a small scale renewable energy scheme sres and large scale renewable energy target lret components to ensure that adequate incentive exists for large scale grid connected renewable energy 73 a number of states have also implemented their own renewable energy targets independent of the commonwealth for example the victorian renewable energy target scheme vret mandated an additional 5 of victorias load for renewable generation although this has since been replaced by the new australian government lret and sres targets 73 south australia achieved its target of 20 of renewable supply by 2014 three years ahead of schedule ie in 2011 and has subsequently established a new target of 33 to be achieved by 2020 74 renewable energy certificates registryedit the renewable energy certificates registry rec-registry is an internet based registry system that is required by the australian renewable energy electricity act 2000 the act 75 the rec-registry is dedicated to maintaining various registers as set in the act and facilitating the creation registration transfer and surrender of renewable energy certificates recs carbon pricingedit in 2012 the gillard government implemented a carbon price of $23 per tonne to be paid by 300 liable entities representing the highest business emitters in australia the carbon price will increase to $25.40 per tonne by 2014–15 and then will be set by the market from 1 july 2015 onwards 76 it is expected that in addition to encouraging efficient use of electricity pricing carbon will encourage investment in cleaner renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power treasury modelling has projected that with a carbon price energy from the renewables sector is likely to reach 40 percent of supply by 2050 77 analysis of the first 6months of operation of the carbon tax have shown that there has been a drop in carbon emissions by the electricity sector it has been observed that there has been a change in the mix of energy over this period with less electricity being sourced from coal and more being produced by renewables such as hydro and wind power 78 the government at the time presented this analysis as an indicator that their policies to promote cleaner energy are working 78 the carbon pricing legislation was repealed by the tony abbott-led australian government on 17 july 2014 79 since then carbon emissions from the electricity sector have increased 80 clean energy finance corporationedit the australian government has announced the creation of the new 10billion dollar clean energy finance corporation which will commence business in july 2013 the goal of this intervention is to overcome barriers to the mobilisation of capital by the renewable energy sector it will make available two billion dollars a year for five years for the financing of renewable energy energy efficiency and low emissions technologies projects in the latter stages of development the government has indicated that the fund is expected to be financially self-sufficient producing a positive return on investment comparable to the long term bond rate 10 81 feed-in tariffsedit feed-in tariffs have been enacted on a state by state basis in australia to encourage investment in renewable energy by providing above commercial rates for electricity generated from sources such as rooftop photovoltaic panels or wind turbines 7 the schemes in place focus on residential scale infrastructure by having limits that effectively exclude larger scale developments such as wind farms feed-in tariffs schemes in australia started at a premium but have mechanisms by which the price paid for electricity decreases over time to be equivalent or below the commercial rate 7 all the schemes now in place in australia are net schemes whereby the householder is only paid for surplus electricity over and above what is actually used in the past new south wales and the australian capital territory enacted gross schemes whereby householders were entitled to be paid for 100 of renewable electricity generated on the premises however these programs have now expired in 2008 the council of australian governments coag agreed to harmonise the various state schemes and developed a set of national principles to apply to new schemes 82 leader of the australian greens christine milne has advocated a uniform national gross feed-in tariff scheme however this proposal has not been enacted 83 subsidies to fossil fuel industryedit there is dispute about the level of subsidies paid to the fossil fuel industry in australia the australian conservation foundation acf argues that according to the definitions of the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd fossil fuel production and use is subsidised in australia by means of direct payments favourable tax treatment and other actions it is suggested these measures act as impediments to investment in renewable energy resources 84 analysis by the acf indicates that these provisions add up to a total annual subsidy of a$7.7billion with the most significant component being the fuel tax credits program that rebates diesel fuel excise to many business users 85 this analysis is disputed by the institute of public affairs ipa who argue that the acfs definition of a subsidy differs from that of the oecd and that the fuel tax rebate schemes are in place to ensure that all producers are treated equally from a tax point of view however the ipa acknowledges that regardless of perceived issues with the acf analysis some level of fossil fuel subsidy is likely in existence 86 ratification of the kyoto protocoledit australia ratified the kyoto protocol in december 2007 under the then newly elected prime minister kevin rudd evidence suggests australia will meet its targets required under this protocol australia had not ratified the kyoto protocol until then due to concerns over a loss of competitiveness with the us which also rejects the treaty 87 public opinion and actionedit survey results suggest that there is considerable public support for the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency in australia in one recent survey 74 of respondents favoured a greenhouse strategy based mainly on energy efficiency and renewable energy and 19 favoured an approach that focuses mainly on nuclear power and clean coal technologies 88 the australian results from the 1st annual world environment review based on a survey of 1,007 people in 2007 found that 89 88 of australians think that the government should do more to increase the use of solar power 78 say the government should do more to boost wind power 58 hydro power 50 tidal power and 38 geothermal power while only 25 think that the government should do more to increase use of nuclear power 84 of australians think that the government should make it easier for people to buy renewable electricity 89 think that all electricity should contain a minimum 25 of power generated from renewable energy sources only 3 disagree 82 think that the government should make it easier for people to buy solar panels 80 think that the government should make it easier for people to buy energy efficient products such as energy-saving light globes water-saving shower heads and insulation etc 85 think that the government should raise national fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks 87 think that the government should do more to increase the number of cars that dont use petrol there is a considerable movement known as the transition decade to transition australias entire energy system to renewable by 2020 voluntary uptake of greenpower a government program initiated in 1997 whereby people can pay extra for electricity that is generated from renewable sources increased from 132,300 customers in 2005 to 904,716 customers in 2009 90 future prospectsedit the percentage of renewable resources that could be achieved by 2020 has evolved from 25 in 2007 to 100 in 2010 david spratt and phillip sutton argue in their book climate code red that australia as part of a concerted global effort needs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions down to zero as quickly as possible so that carbon dioxide can be drawn down from the atmosphere and greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced to less than 325ppm co2-e which they argue is the upper safe climate level at which we can continue developing infinitely they outline a plan of action which would accomplish this 94 recently an uptake of third party ownership models for small to mid-scale solar photovoltaic systems has been seen in australia mirroring developments in the same direction in the us with over 70 of all new pv systems installed under such models in california colorado and arizona 98 in australia the solar power purchase agreement approach is pursued under the term solar sponsoring 99 see alsoedit energy portal renewable energy portal australia portal environment portal centre for
