gibbs von helmholtz joule maxwell von mayer onsager rankine smeaton stahl thompson thomson waterston v t e carnots theorem developed in 1824 by nicolas léonard sadi carnot also called carnots rule is a principle that specifies limits on the maximum efficiency any heat engine can obtain the efficiency of a carnot engine depends solely on the difference between the hot and cold temperature reservoirs carnots theorem states all heat engines between two heat reservoirs are less efficient than a carnot heat engine operating between the same reservoirs every carnot heat engine between a pair of heat reservoirs is equally efficient regardless of the working substance employed or the operation details the formula for this maximum efficiency is where tc is the absolute temperature of the cold reservoir th is the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir and the efficiency η displaystyle eta  is the ratio of the work done by the engine to the heat drawn out of the hot reservoir based on modern thermodynamics carnots theorem is a result of the second law of thermodynamics historically however it was based on contemporary caloric theory and preceded the establishment of the second law 1  contents 1 proof 1.1 reversible engines 1.2 irreversible engines 2 definition of thermodynamic temperature 3 applicability to fuel cells and batteries 4 references 1.1 reversible engines 1.2 irreversible engines  proofedit the proof of the carnot theorem is a proof by contradiction or reductio ad absurdum as illustrated by the figure showing two heat engines operating between two reservoirs of different temperature the heat engine with more efficiency  η m displaystyle eta m  is driving a heat engine with less efficiency  η l displaystyle eta l  causing the latter to act as a heat pump this pair of engines receives no outside energy and operates solely on the energy released when heat is transferred from the hot and into the cold reservoir however if η m  η l displaystyle eta meta l  then the net heat flow would be backwards ie into the hot reservoir it is generally agreed that this is impossible because it violates the second law of thermodynamics we begin by verifying the values of work and heat flow depicted in the figure first we must point out an important caveat the engine with less efficiency  η l displaystyle eta l  is being driven as a heat pump and therefore must be a reversible engine if the less efficient engine  η l displaystyle eta l  is not reversible then the device could be built but the expressions for work and heat flow shown in the figure would not be valid by restricting our discussion to cases where engine  η l displaystyle eta l  has less efficiency than engine  η m displaystyle eta m  we are able to simplify notation by adopting the convention that all symbols q displaystyle q and w displaystyle w represent non-negative quantities since the direction of energy flow never changes sign in all cases where η l  η m displaystyle eta lleqslant eta m  conservation of energy demands that for each engine the energy which enters e i n displaystyle ein  must equal the energy which exits e o u t displaystyle eout  the figure is also consistent with the definition of efficiency as η  w  q h displaystyle eta wqh for both engines it may seem odd that a hypothetical heat pump with low efficiency is being used to violate the second law of thermodynamics but the figure of merit for refrigerator units is not efficiency w  q h displaystyle wqh  but the coefficient of performance cop 2 which is q c  w displaystyle qcw  a reversible heat engine with low thermodynamic efficiency w  q h displaystyle wqh delivers more heat to the hot reservoir for a given amount of work when it is being driven as a heat pump having established that the heat flow values shown in the figure are correct carnots theorem may be proven for irreversible and the reversible heat engines 3 reversible enginesedit to see that every reversible engine operating between reservoirs t 1 displaystyle t{1 and t 2 displaystyle t{2 must have the same efficiency assume that two reversible heat engines have different values of η displaystyle eta   and let the more efficient engine m drive the less efficient engine l as a heat pump as the figure shows this will cause heat to flow from the cold to the hot reservoir without any external work or energy which violates the second law of thermodynamics therefore both reversible heat engines have the same efficiency and we conclude that this is an important result because it helps establish the clausius theorem which implies that the change in entropy is unique for all reversible processes 4 over all paths from a to b in v-t space if this integral were not path independent then entropy s would lose its status as a state variable 5 irreversible enginesedit if one of the engines is irreversible it must be the m engine placed so that it reverse drives the less efficient but reversible l engine but if this irreversible engine is more efficient than the reversible engine ie if η m  η l displaystyle eta meta l  then the second law of thermodynamics is violated and since the carnot cycle represents a reversible engine we have the first part of carnots theorem definition of thermodynamic temperatureedit the efficiency of the engine is the work divided by the heat introduced to the system or η  w c y q h  q h  q c q h  1  q c q h displaystyle eta frac wcyqhfrac qh-qcqh=1-frac qcqh       1 where wcy is the work done per cycle thus the efficiency depends only on qcqh because all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient any reversible heat engine operating between temperatures t1 and t2 must have the same efficiency meaning the efficiency is the function of the temperatures only q c q h  f  t h  t c  displaystyle frac qcqhfthtc       2 in addition a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures t1 and t3 must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles one between t1 and another intermediate temperature t2 and the second between t2andt3 this can only be the case if specializing to the case that t 1 displaystyle t{1 is a fixed reference temperature the temperature of the triple point of water then for any t2 and t3 therefore if thermodynamic temperature is defined by then the function f viewed as a function of thermodynamic temperature is and the reference temperature t1 has the value 273.16 of course any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be usedthe choice here corresponds to the kelvin scale it follows immediately that q c q h  f  t h  t c   t c t h displaystyle frac qcqhfthtcfrac tcth       3 substituting equation 3 back into equation 1 gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of temperature η  1  q c q h  1  t c t h displaystyle eta =1-frac qcqh=1-frac tcth       4 applicability to fuel cells and batteriesedit since fuel cells and batteries can generate useful power when all components of the system are at the same temperature  t  t h  t c displaystyle tthtc  they are clearly not limited by carnots theorem which states that no power can be generated when t h  t c displaystyle thtc  this is because carnots theorem applies to engines converting thermal energy to work whereas fuel cells and batteries instead convert chemical energy to work 6 nevertheless the second law of thermodynamics still provides restrictions on fuel cell and battery energy conversion 7 referencesedit
