performance per watt in computing performance per watt is a measure of the energy efficiency of a particular computer architecture or computer hardware literally it measures the rate of computation that can be delivered by a computer for every watt of power consumed performance unlike watt isnt an objective thing it depends on what the computer is working on but the green500 list ranks the most efficient computers according to one possible benchmark system designers building parallel computers such as googles hardware pick cpus based on their other than green500 performance per watt of power because the cost of powering the cpu outweighs the cost of the cpu itself 1  contents 1 definition 2 flops per watt 2.1 examples 3 green500 list 4 gpu efficiency 5 challenges 6 other energy efficiency

measures of performance are flops mips or the score for any performance benchmark several measures of power usage may be employed depending on the purposes of the metric for example a metric might only consider the electrical power delivered to a machine directly while another might include all power necessary to run a computer such as cooling and monitoring systems the power measurement is often the average power used while running the benchmark but other measures of power usage may be employed eg peak power idle power for example the early univac i computer performed approximately 0.015 operations per watt-second performing 1,905 operations per second ops while consuming 125kw the fujitsu fr-v vliwvector processor system on a chip in the 4 fr550 core variant released 2005 performs 51 giga-ops with 3 watts of power consumption resulting in 17 billion operations per watt-second 2 3 this is an improvement by over a trillion times in 54 years most of the power a computer uses is converted into heat so a system that takes fewer watts to do a job will require less cooling to maintain a given operating temperature reduced cooling demands makes it easier to quiet a computer lower energy consumption can also make it less costly to run and reduce the environmental impact of powering the computer see green computing if installed where there is limited climate control a lower power computer will operate at a lower temperature which may make it more reliable in a climate controlled environment reductions in direct power use may also create savings in climate control energy computing energy consumption is sometimes also measured by reporting the energy required to run a particular benchmark for instance eembc energybench energy consumption figures for a standard workload may make it easier to judge the effect of an improvement in energy efficiency performance in operationssecond per watt can also be written as operationswatt-second or operationsjoule since 1 watt  1 joulesecond flops per wattedit flops floating point operations per second per watt is a common measure like the flops it is based on the metric is usually applied to scientific computing and simulations involving many floating point calculations examplesedit as of june 2016update the green500 list rates the two most efficient supercomputers highest those are both based on

gpu efficiencyedit graphics processing units gpu have continued to increase in energy usage while cpus designers have recently focused on improving performance per watt high performance gpus may draw large amount of power and hence intelligent techniques are required to manage gpu power consumption 26 measures like 3dmark2006 score per watt can help identify more efficient gpus 27 however that may not adequately incorporate efficiency in typical use where much time is spent doing less demanding tasks 28 with modern gpus energy usage is an important constraint on the maximum computational capabilities that can be achieved gpu designs are usually highly scalable allowing the manufacturer to put multiple chips on the same video card or to use multiple video cards that work in parallel peak performance of any system is essentially limited by the amount of power it can draw and the amount of heat it can dissipate consequently performance per watt of a gpu design translates directly into peak performance of a system that uses that design since gpus may also be used for some general purpose computation sometimes their performance is measured in terms also applied to cpus such as flops per watt challengesedit while performance per watt is useful absolute power requirements are also important claims of improved performance per watt may be used to mask increasing power demands for instance though newer generation gpu architectures may provide better performance per watt continued performance increases can negate the gains in efficiency and the gpus continue to consume large amounts of power 29 benchmarks that measure power under heavy load may not adequately reflect typical efficiency for instance 3dmark stresses the 3d performance of a gpu but many computers spend most of their time doing less intense display tasks idle 2d tasks displaying video so the 2d or idle efficiency of the graphics system may be at least as significant for overall energy efficiency likewise systems that spend much of their time in standby or soft off are not adequately characterized by just efficiency under load to help address this some benchmarks like specpower include measurements at a series of load levels 30 the efficiency of some electrical components such as voltage regulators decreases with increasing temperature so the power used may increase with temperature power supplies motherboards and some video cards are some of the subsystems affected by this so their power draw may depend on temperature and the temperature or temperature dependence should be noted when measuring 31 32 performance per watt also typically does not include full life-cycle costs since computer manufacturing is energy intensive and computers often have a relatively short lifespan energy and materials involved in production distribution disposal and recycling often make up significant portions of their cost energy use and environmental impact 33 34 energy required for climate control of the computers surroundings is often not counted in the wattage calculation but it can be significant 35 other energy efficiency measuresedit swap space wattage and performance is a sun microsystems
