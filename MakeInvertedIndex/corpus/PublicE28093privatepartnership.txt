publicprivate partnership a publicprivate partnership ppp 3p or p3 is a cooperative arrangement between one or more public and private sector actors typically of a long term nature 1 governments have used such a mix of public and private endeavors throughout history 2 3 however the past few decades has seen a clear trend towards governments across the globe making greater use of various ppp arrangements 4 there is no consensus about how to define a ppp 5 ppps can be understood of both as a governance mechanism and a language game 6 when understood as a language game or brand the ppp phrase can cover hundreds of different types of long term contracts with a wide range of risk allocations funding arrangements and transparency requirements and as a brand the ppp concept is also closely related to concepts such as privatization and the contracting out of government services 7 8 when understood as a governance mechanism the ppp concept encompasses at least five families of potential arrangements one of which is the long term infrastructure contract in the model of the uks private finance initiative pfi 9 10 11 particular types of arrangements have been favored in different countries at different times infrastructure ppps as a phenomenon can be understood at five different levels as a particular project or activity as a form of project delivery as a statement of government policy as a tool of government or as a wider cultural phenomena 12 different disciplines commonly emphasize different aspects of the ppp phenomena 13 the engineering and economics professions primarily take a utilitarian functional focus emphasising concerns such as project delivery and relative value- for-money vfm compared to the traditional ways of delivering large infrastructure projects in contrast public administrators and political scientists tend to view ppps more as a policy brand and as a useful tool for governments to achieve their objectives common themes of ppps are the sharing of risk and the development of innovative long term relationships between the public and private sectors 14 the use of private finance is another key dimension of many ppps particularly those influenced by the uk pfi model although this has aspect has waned since the global financial crisis of 2008 15 the ppp phenomenon has been controversial the lack of a shared understanding of what a ppp is makes the process of evaluating whether ppps have been successful complex 16 evidence of ppp performance in terms of vfm and efficiency for example is mixed and often unavailable 17 18  contents 1 long term infrastructure contracts 2 origins 3 in specific countries 3.1 australia 3.2 canada 3.3 china 3.4 india 3.5 japan 3.6 philippines 3.7 puerto rico 3.8 russia 3.9

3.9 united kingdom 3.10 united states 5.1 privatisation of water  long term infrastructure contractsedit ppps often involve a contract between a public sector authority and a private party in which the private party provides a public service or project and assumes substantial financial technical and operational risk in the project in some types of ppp the cost of using the service is borne exclusively by the users of the service and not by the taxpayer 19 in other types notably the pfi capital investment is made by the private sector on the basis of a contract with government to provide agreed services and the cost of providing the service is borne wholly or in part by the government government contributions to a ppp may also be in kind notably the transfer of existing assets in projects that are aimed at creating public goods like in the infrastructure sector the government may provide a capital subsidy in the form of a one-time grant so as to make the project economically viable in some other cases the government may support the project by providing revenue subsidies including tax breaks or by guaranteed annual revenues for a fixed time period in all cases the partnerships include a transfer of significant risks to the private sector generally in an integrated and holistic way minimizing interfaces for the public entity an optimal risk allocation is the main value generator for this model of delivering public service there many drivers for ppps one common driver involves the claim that ppps enable the public sector to harness the expertise and efficiencies that the private sector can bring to the delivery of certain facilities and services traditionally procured and delivered by the public sector another common driver is that ppps may be structured so that the public sector body seeking to make a capital investment does not incur any borrowing rather the ppp borrowing is incurred by the private sector vehicle implementing the project on ppp projects where the cost of using the service is intended to be borne exclusively by the end user the ppp is from the public sectors perspective an off-balance sheet method of financing the delivery of new or refurbished public sector assets on ppp projects where the public sector intends to compensate the private sector through availability payments once the facility is established or renewed the financing is from the public sectors perspective on-balance sheet however the public sector will regularly benefit from significantly deferred cash flows generally financing costs will be higher for a ppp than for a traditional public financing because of the private sector higher cost of capital however extra financing costs can be offset by private sector efficiency savings resulting from a holistic approach to delivering the project or service and from the better risk allocation in the long run typically a private sector consortium forms a special company called a special purpose vehicle spv to develop build maintain and operate the asset for the contracted period 19 20 in cases where the government has invested in the project it is typically but not always allotted an equity share in the spv 21 the consortium is usually made up of a building contractor a maintenance company and equity investors it is the spv that signs the contract with the government and with subcontractors to build the facility and then maintain it in the infrastructure sector complex arrangements and contracts that guarantee and secure the cash flows make ppp projects prime candidates for project financing a typical ppp example would be a hospital building financed and constructed by a private developer and then leased to the hospital authority the private developer then acts as landlord providing housekeeping and other non-medical services while the hospital itself provides medical services 19 originsedit pressure to change the standard model of public procurement arose initially from concerns about the level of public debt which grew rapidly during the macroeconomic dislocation of the 1970s and 1980s governments sought to encourage private investment in infrastructure initially on the basis of accounting fallacies arising from the fact that public accounts did not distinguish between recurrent and capital expenditures the idea that private provision of infrastructure represented a way of providing infrastructure at no cost to the public has now been generally abandoned however interest in alternatives to the standard model of public procurement persisted in particular it has been argued that models involving an enhanced role for the private sector with a single private-sector organization taking responsibility for most aspects of service provisions for a given project could yield an improved allocation of risk while maintaining public accountability for essential aspects of service provision initially most publicprivate partnerships were negotiated individually as one-off deals and much of this activity began in the early 1990s in the uk ppps are organized along a continuum between public and private nodes and needs as they integrate normative albeit separate and distinct functions of societythe market and the commons a common challenge for ppps is allowing for these fluctuations and reinforcing the intended partnership without diminishing either sector multisectoral or collaborative partnering is experienced on a continuum of private to public in varying degrees of implementation according to the need time restraints and the issue at hand even though these partnerships are now common it is normal for both private and public sectors to be critical of the others approach and methods it is at the merger of these sectors that we see how a unified partnership has immediate impact in the development of communities and the provision of public services in specific countriesedit australiaedit a number of australian state governments have adopted systematic programmes based on the pfi the first and the model for most others is partnerships victoria canadaedit the federal conservative government under stephen harper in canada solidified its commitment to p3s with the creation of a crown corporation p3 canada inc in 2009 the canadian vanguards for p3s have been provincial organizations supported by the canadian council for public-private partnerships established in 1993 a member-sponsored organization with representatives from both the public and the private sectors as a proponent of the concept of p3s the council conducts research publishes findings facilitates forums for discussion and sponsors an annual conference on relevant topics both domestic and international each year the council celebrates successful publicprivate partnerships through the national awards program held concurrently with the annual conference in november at lower levels of government p3s have been used to build major infrastructure projects like transit systems such as viva bus rapid transit and ontario highway 407 chinaedit the municipal government of shantou china signed a 50-billion rmb ppp agreement with the citic group to develop a massive residential project spanning an area of 168 square kilometers locating on the southern district of the citys central business district 22 the project includes real estate development infrastructure construction including a cross-harbor tunnel and industry developments the project named shantou coastal new town aims itself to be a high-end cultural leisure business hub of the east guangdong area indiaedit the government of india defines a p3 as a partnership between a public sector entity sponsoring authority and a private sector entity a legal entity in which 51 or more of equity is with the private partners for the creation andor management of infrastructure for public purpose for a specified period of time concession period on commercial terms and in which the private partner has been procured through a transparent and open procurement system 23 the union government has estimated an investment of $320 billion in infrastructure in the 10th plan 24 the major infrastructure development projects in the indian state of maharashtra more than 50 are based on the p3 model in the 2000s other states such as karnataka madhya pradesh gujarat and tamil nadu also adopted this model sector-wise road projects account for about 53.4 of the total projects in numbers and 46 in terms of value ports come in second place and account for 8 of the total projects  21 of the total value 25 other sectors including power irrigation telecommunication water supply and airports have gained momentum through the p3 model as of 2011update these sectors are expected to get an investment of rs 2,027,169 crore according to 2006–2007 wpi 26 japanedit in japan since the 1980s the third sector 第三セクター daisan sekutā refers to joint corporations invested in by

wikipedia articles on specific ppp projects in puerto rico are categorized into categorypublic-private partnerships in puerto rico russiaedit the first attempt to introduce ppp in russia was made in st petersburg law #627-100  25.12.2006 on st petersburg participation in public-private partnership 29 nowadays there are special laws about ppp in 69 subjects of russian federation 30 but the biggest part of them are just declarations besides ppp in russia is also regulated by federal law #115-fz  21.07.2005 on concessional agreements 31 and federal law #94-fz  21.07.2005 on procurement of goods works and services for state and municipal needs 32 in some ways ppp is also regulated by federal law №116-fz  22.07.2005 on special economic zones 33 in terms of providing business benefits on special territories - in the broadest sense it is a variation of ppp still all those laws and documents do not cover all possible ppp forms in february 2013 experts rated subjects of russian federation according to their preparedness for implementing projects via publicprivate partnership the most developed region is saint petersburg with rating 7.8 the least  chukotka rating 0.0 by 2013 there were almost 300 publicprivate partnership projects in russia 34 united kingdomedit in 1992 the conservative government of john major in the uk introduced the pfi 35 the first systematic programme aimed at encouraging publicprivate partnerships the 1992 programme focused on reducing the public sector borrowing requirement although as already noted the effect on public accounts was largely illusory the labour government of tony blair elected in 1997 expanded the pfi initiative but sought to shift the emphasis to the achievement of value for money mainly through an appropriate allocation of risk however it has since been found that many programs ran dramatically over budget and have not presented as value for money for the taxpayer with some projects costing more to cancel than to complete united statesedit the west coast infrastructure exchange wcx a stateprovincial government-level partnership between california oregon washington and british columbia that was launched in 2012 conducts business case evaluations for selected infrastructure projects and connects private investment with public infrastructure opportunities the platform aims to replace traditional approaches to infrastructure financing and development with performance-based infrastructure marked by projects that are funded where possible by internal rates of return as opposed to tax dollars and evaluated according to life-cycle social ecological and economic impacts as opposed to capacity addition and capital cost 36 the my brothers keeper challenge is another example of a publicprivate partnership growth and declineedit from 1990 to 2009 nearly 1,400 ppp deals were signed in the european union representing a capital value of approximately €260 billion 37 since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008 estimates suggest that the number of ppp deals closed has fallen more than 40 percent 38 39 investments in public sector infrastructure are seen as an important means of maintaining economic activity as was highlighted in a european commission communication on ppps 40 as a result of the significant role that ppps have adopted in the development of public sector infrastructure in addition to the complexity of such transactions the european ppp expertise centre epec was established to support public-sector capacity to implement ppps and share timely solutions to problems common across europe in ppps 41 ppps provide a unique perspective on the collaborative and network aspects of public management the advancement of ppps as a concept and a practice is a product of the new public management of the late 20th century and globalization pressures the term publicprivate partnership is prey to thinking in parts rather than the whole of the partnership which makes it difficult to pin down a universally accepted definition of ppps us city managers motivations for exploring publicprivate service delivery vary according to a 2007 survey two primary reasons were expressed cost reduction  86.7 and external fiscal pressures including tax restrictions  50.3 no other motivations expressed exceeded 16 in the 2012 survey however interest had shifted to the need for better processes  69 relationship building  77 better outcomes  81 leveraging resources  84 and belief that collaborative service delivery is the right thing to do  86 among those surveyed the provision of public services through contracts with private firms peaked in 1977 at 18 and has declined since the most common form of shared service delivery now involves contracts between governments growing from 17 in 2002 to 20 in 2007 at the same time approximately 22 of the local governments in the survey indicated that they had brought back in-house at least one service that they had previously provided through some alternative private arrangement 42 controversyedit a common problem with ppp projects is that private investors obtained a rate of return that was higher than the governments bond rate even though most or all of the income risk associated with the project was borne by the public sector 39 a 2008 report by pricewaterhousecoopers argued that the comparison between public and private borrowing rates is not fair because there are constraints on public borrowing which may imply that public borrowing is too high and so pfi projects can be beneficial by not putting debt directly on government books 43 a number of australian studies of early initiatives to promote private investment in infrastructure concluded that in most cases the schemes being proposed were inferior to the standard model of public procurement based on competitively tendered construction of publicly owned assets 44 in 2009 the new zealand treasury in response to inquiries by the new national party government released a report on ppp schemes that concluded that there is little reliable empirical evidence about the costs and benefits of ppps and that there are other ways of obtaining private sector finance as well as that the advantages of ppps must be weighed against the contractual complexities and rigidities they entail 45 one response to these negative findings was the development of formal procedures for the assessment of ppps in which the focus was on value for money rather than reductions in debt the underlying framework was one in which value for money was achieved by an appropriate allocation of risk these assessment procedures were incorporated in the private finance initiative and its australian counterparts from the late 1990s onwardscitation needed another model being discussed is the publicprivate community partnership ppcp in which both the government and private players work together for social welfare eliminating the prime focus of private players on profitcitation needed this model is being applied more in developing nations such as indiacitation needed privatisation of wateredit after a wave of privatisation of many water services in the 1990s mostly in developing countries experiences show that global water corporations have not brought the promised improvements in public water utilities instead of lower prices large volumes of investment and improvements in the connection of the poor to water and sanitation water tariffs have increased out of reach of poor households water multinationals are withdrawing from developing countries and the world bank is reluctant to provide support 46 the privatisation of the water services of the city of paris was proven to be unwanted and at the end of 2009 the city did not renew its contract with two of the french water corporations suez and veolia 47 48 after one year of being controlled by the public it is projected that the water tariff will be cut by between 5 and 10 49 contract management is a crucial factor in shared service delivery and services that are more challenging to monitor or fully capture in contractual language often remain in municipal control in the 2007 survey of us city managers the most difficult was judged to be the operation and management of hospitals and the least difficult the cleaning of streets and parking lots the study revealed that communities often fail to sufficiently monitor collaborative agreements or other forms of service delivery for instance in 2002 only 47.3 of managers involved with private firms as delivery partners reported that they evaluate that service delivery by 2007 that was down to 45.4 performance monitoring is a general concern from these surveys and in the scholarly criticisms of these arrangements 42 50 health servicesedit a health services ppp can be described as a long-term contract typically 15–30 years between a public-sector authority and one or more private sector companies operating as a legal entity the government provides the strength of its purchasing power outlines goals for an optimal health system and empowers private enterprise to innovate build maintain andor manage delivery of agreed-upon services over the term of the contract the private sector receives payment for its services and assumes substantial financial technical and operational risk while benefitting from the upside potential of shared cost savings the private entity is made up of any combination of participants who have a vested interested in working together to provide core competencies in operations technology funding and technical expertise the opportunity for multi-sector market participants includes hospital providers and physician groups technology companies pharmaceutical and medical device companies private health insurers facilities managers and construction firms funding sources could include banks private equity firms philanthropists and pension fund managers for more than two decades publicprivate partnerships have been used to finance health infrastructure governments are increasingly looking to the ppp-model to solve larger problems in healthcare delivery there is not a country in the world where healthcare is financed entirely by the governmentcitation needed while the provision of health is widely recognized as the responsibility of government private capital and expertise are increasingly viewed as sources to induce efficiency and innovation as ppps move from financing infrastructure to managing care delivery there is an opportunity to reduce overall cost of healthcare the larger scope of health ppps to manage and finance care delivery and infrastructure means a larger potential market for private organizations pricewaterhousecoopers projects that spending on healthcare among the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd and bric nations of brazil russia india and china will grow by 51 percent between 2010 and 2020 amounting to a cumulative total of more than $71 trillion 51 of this $3.6 trillion is projected to be spent on health infrastructure and $68.1 trillion will be spent on non-infrastructure health spending cumulatively over the next decade annually spending on health infrastructure among the oecd and bric nations is projected to increase to $397 billion by 2020 up from $263 billion in 2010 the larger market for health ppps is projected to be in non-infrastructure spending estimated to be more than $7.5 trillion annually up from $5 trillion in 2010 51 health spending in the united states accounts for approximately half of all health spending among oecd nations but the biggest growth will be outside of the us according to pwc projections the countries that are expected to have the highest health spending growth between 2010 and 2020 are china where health spending is expected to increase by 166 percent and india which will see a 140 percent increase as health spending increases it is putting pressure on governments and spurring them to look for private capital and expertise 51 product development partnershipsedit product development partnerships pdps are a class of publicprivate partnerships that focus on pharmaceutical product development for diseases of the developing world these include preventive medicines such as vaccines and microbicides as well as treatments for otherwise neglected diseases pdps were first created in the 1990s to unite the public sectors commitment to international public goods for health with industrys intellectual property expertise in product development and marketing international pdps work to accelerate research and development of pharmaceutical products for underserved populations that are not profitable for private companies they may also be involved in helping plan for access and availability of the products they develop to those in need in their target populations publicly financed with intellectual property rights granted by pharmaceutical industry partners for specific markets pdps are able to focus on their missions rather than concerns about recouping development costs through the profitability of the products being developed these not-for-profit organizations bridge public- and private-sector interests with a view toward resolving the specific incentive and financial barriers to increased industry involvement in the development of safe and effective pharmaceutical products international product development partnerships and publicprivate partnerships include the path malaria vaccine initiative mvi is a global program of the international nonprofit organization program for appropriate technology in health path mvi was established in 1999 to accelerate the development of malaria vaccines and ensure their availability and accessibility in the developing world the roll back malaria rbm partnership was founded in 1998 rbm is the global framework for coordinated action against malaria it

faster-acting novel treatments for tuberculosis that are affordable and accessible to the developing world a un agency the world health organization who is financed through the un system by contributions from member states in recent years whos work has involved more collaboration with ngos and the pharmaceutical industry as well as with foundations such as the bill and melinda gates foundation and the rockefeller foundation some of these collaborations may be considered global publicprivate partnerships gppps 15 of whos total revenue in 2012 was financed by private foundations 52 the united nations foundation  vodafone foundation technology partnership a five-year $30 million commitment leverages the power of mobile technology to support and strengthen humanitarian work worldwide partners include the world health organization who datadyne the mhealth alliance the world food program wfp telecoms sans frontieres and the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha a good resource on the origins challenges and benefits of pdps is in this nbr interview httpnbrorgresearchactivityaspxid=477 similar publicprivate partnerships outside the realm of specific public-health goods include the united nations international strategy for disaster reduction unisdr is part of the united nations secretariat and its functions span the development and humanitarian fields publicprivate partnerships for disaster management bring together the private sector for ppp models with a tool box of partnership opportunities towards resilience capacity building and sustainability goals 53 the publicprivate partnership for improving teaching and learning in schools in abu dhabi united arab emirates financingedit a key motivation for governments considering public-private partnerships is the possibility of bringing in new sources of financing for funding public infrastructure and service needs 39 it is important to understand the main mechanisms for infrastructure projects the principal investors in developing countries sources of finance limited recourse debt equity etc the typical project finance structure and key issues arising from developing project financed transactions 54 an interesting aspect quite ubiquitous in project finance is the dual nature of the parties involved being both service providers to and contracted with the newly created entity special purpose entity and shareholders of that entity for example it is quite common for the construction contractor or operations and maintenance service provider to hold an equity stake in a project finances capital structure 55 some governments utilize a public sector comparator for assessing the financial benefit of a public-private partnership and the optimal level of private sector involvement a number of key risks need to be taken into consideration as well these risks will need to be allocated and managed to ensure the successful financing of the project the party that is best placed to manage these risks in a cost-effective way may not necessarily always be the private sector however there are a number of mechanisms products available in the market for project sponsors lenders and governments to mitigate some of the project risks such as hedging and futures contracts insurance and risk mitigation products provided by international finance institutions 56 centralised unitsedit the world bank  2007 57 states that governments tend to create centralised ppp units as a response to weaknesses in the central governments ability to effectively manage ppp programmes different governments suffer from different institutional failures in the ppp procurement process hence these centralised ppp units need to address these different issues by shaping their functions to suit the individual government needs the function location within government and jurisdiction ie who controls it of dedicated ppp units may differ amongst countries but generally these include policy guidance and advice on the content of national legislation guidance also includes defining which sectors are eligible for ppps as well as which ppp methods and schemes can be carried out approving or rejecting proposed ppp projects ie playing a gatekeeper role that can occur at any stage of the process ie at the initial planning stage or at the final approval stage providing technical support to government organisations at the project identification evaluation procurement or contract management phase capacity building ie training of public sector officials that are involved in ppp programmes or are interested in the ppp process promote ppps within the private sector ie ppp market development a 2013 review 58 which targeted research based on the value of centralised ppp units and does not look at the value of ppps in general or any other type of ppp arrangement as the review was aimed at providing evidence needed to decide whether or not to set up a centralised ppp unit found- no quantitative evidence there is very little quantitative evidence of the value of centralised ppp coordination units against ministries or government agencies individually procuring ppp projects most of the studies available on ppp units tend to focus on their role and only carry out brief descriptive analyses of their value limited authority the majority of the ppp units reviewed in the literature do not play a particularly important role in approving or rejecting ppp programmes or projects whilst their advice is used in the decision making process by other government bodies the majority do not actually have any executive power to make such decisions themselves hence when they have more authority their value is seen to be higher ppp units differ by country and sector government failures in regards to ppp units vary by government the requirements for ppps also vary by country and sector and so do the risks involved ie financial social etc for the country government hence ppp units need to be tailored to solve these failures properly assess risks and be located in the correct government departments where it can command the most power ppp units can play a number of important roles in the ppp process however not all ppp units will play the same role as their functions have been tailored to individual country needs in some cases limits to their authority have curtailed their effectiveness implicit value the lack of rigorous evidence does not prove that ppp units are not an important contributor to the success of a countrys ppp programme the literature review does show that whilst there is no quantitative data there are widespread perceptions on the importance of a well-functioning ppp unit for the success of a countrys ppp programme the author of the 2013 review 58 found no literature that rigorously evaluates the usefulness of ppp units the literature does show that ppp units should be individually tailored to different government functions address different government failures and be appropriately positioned to support the countrys ppp programme where these conditions seem to have been met there is consensus that ppp units have played a positive role in national ppp programmes specific casesedit while some ppp projects have proceeded smoothly others have been highly controversial australian examples include the airport link the cross city tunnel 59 and the sydney harbour tunnel all in sydney the southern cross station redevelopment in melbourne and the robina hospital in queensland in india publicprivate partnerships have been extremely successful in developing infrastructure particularly road assets under the national highways authority of india and midday meal scheme with akshaya patra foundation in canada publicprivate partnerships have become significant in both social and infrastructure development ppp canada inc was created as a crown corporation with an independent board of directors reporting through the minister of finance to parliament its mandate is to improve the delivery of public infrastructure by achieving better value timeliness and accountability to taxpayers through p3s the corporation became operational in february 2009 with the appointments of a chair of the board of directors and a chief executive officer ppps exist in a variety of forms in british columbia through the focused efforts of partnerships bc a company registered under the business corporations act that is wholly owned by the province of british columbia and reports to its shareholder the minister of finance projects include the canada line rapid transit line the abbotsford hospital and cancer centre and the sea-to-sky highway project 60 in quebec a number of notable ppps include the mcgill university health centre the new western extension of autoroute 30 and université de montréals hospital research center in the uk two-thirds of the london underground ppp was taken back into public control in july 2007 after only four and a half years at an estimated cost of £2 billion and the remaining one-third was taken back into public control in may 2010 after seven and a half years for a purchase price of £310m 61 the government had paid advisers £180m for structuring negotiating and implementing the ppp and had reimbursed £275m of bid costs to the winning bidders 62 the 30-year ppp contract for the refurbishment of the mod main building in london was estimated to give a saving of only £100,000 as compared to the £746.2m cost of public procurement 63 the refinancing of the fazakerley prison pfi contract following the completion of construction delivered an 81 gain to the private sector operator 64 the nats ppp saw 51 of the uks air traffic control service transferred to the private sector however following the decline in air traffic after the september 11 attacks the government and baa limited each invested £65m in the private sector operator in 2003 65 in newfoundland robert gillespie reid contracted to operate the railways for fifty years from 1898 though originally they were to become his property at the end of the period studiesedit a 2013 study published in state and local government review found that definitions of publicprivate partnerships vary widely between municipalities many public and private officials tout public-private partnerships for any number of activities when in truth the relationship is contractual a franchise or the load shedding of some previously public service to a private or nonprofit entity a more general term for such agreements is shared service delivery  municipalities joining together with private firms or with nonprofits to provide services to citizens 42 50 economic theoryedit in economic theory publicprivate partnerships have been studied through the lens of contract theory the first theoretical study on ppps has been conducted by oliver hart 66 from an economic theory perspective what distinguishes a ppp from traditional public procurement of infrastructure services is the fact that the building and operating stages are bundled in the case of ppps hence the private firm has strong incentives in the building stage to make investments with regard to the operating stage these investments can be desirable but may also be undesirable eg when the investments not only reduce operating costs but also reduce service quality hence there is a trade-off and it depends on the particular situation whether a ppp or traditional procurement is to be preferred harts model has been extended in several directions for instance authors have studied various externalities between the building and operating stages 67 insurance when firms are risk-averse 68 and implications of ppps for incentives to innovate and gather information 69 challenges and barriersedit publicprivate partnerships have seen a large increase over the years in part because local and state governments rely heavily on the growing number of non-profits to provide many public services that they cannot 70 entering into a public-private partnership can be rewarding as well as destructive if not done with caution and education partnerships need balance from both parties as well as continuous maintenance if entered into lightly one can find its organization falling in various areas proving to be one of
