biochar biochar is charcoal used as a soil amendment like most charcoal biochar is made from biomass via pyrolysis biochar is under investigation as an approach to carbon sequestration to produce negative carbon dioxide emissions 1 biochar thus has the potential to help mitigate climate change via carbon sequestration 2 3 independently biochar can increase soil fertility of acidic soils low ph soils increase agricultural productivity and provide protection against some foliar and soil-borne diseases 4 furthermore biochar reduces pressure on forests 5 biochar is a stable solid rich in carbon

bio-oil and syngas  historyedit pre-columbian amazonians are believed to have used biochar to enhance soil productivity they produced it by smoldering agricultural waste ie covering burning biomass with soil 6 in pits or trenches 7 european settlers called it terra preta de indio 8 following observations and experiments a research team working in french guiana hypothesized that the amazonian earthworm pontoscolex corethrurus was the main agent of fine powdering and incorporation of charcoal debris to the mineral soil 9 the term biochar was coined by peter read to describe charcoal used as a soil improvement 10 productionedit biochar is a high-carbon fine-grained residue that today is produced through modern pyrolysis processes which is the direct thermal decomposition of biomass in the absence of oxygen which prevents combustion to obtain an array of solid biochar liquid bio-oil and gas syngas products the specific yield from the pyrolysis is dependent on process conditions such as temperature and can be optimized to produce either energy or biochar 11 temperatures of 400–500c  752–932f produce more char while temperatures above 700c  1,292f favor the yield of liquid and gas fuel components 12 pyrolysis occurs more quickly at the higher temperatures typically requiring seconds instead of hours high temperature pyrolysis is also known as gasification and produces primarily syngas 12 typical yields are 60 bio-oil 20 biochar and 20 syngas by comparison slow pyrolysis can produce substantially more char ~50 once initialized both processes produce net energy for typical inputs the energy required to run a fast pyrolyzer is approximately 15 of the energy that it outputs 13 modern pyrolysis plants can use the syngas created by the pyrolysis process and output 3–9 times the amount of energy required to run 7 the amazonian pittrench method 7 harvests neither bio-oil nor syngas and releases a large amount of co2 black carbon and other greenhouse gases ghgs and potentially toxins into the air commercial-scale systems process agricultural waste paper byproducts and even municipal waste and typically eliminate these side effects by capturing and using the liquid and gas products centralized decentralized and mobile systemsedit in a centralized system all biomass in a region is brought to a central plant for processing alternatively each farmer or group of farmers can operate a lower-tech kiln finally a truck equipped with a pyrolyzer can move from place to place to pyrolyze biomass vehicle power comes from the syngas stream while the biochar remains on the farm the biofuel is sent to a refinery or storage site factors that influence the choice of system type include the cost of transportation of the liquid and solid byproducts the amount of material to be processed and the ability to feed directly into the power grid for crops that are not exclusively for biochar production the residue-to-product ratio rpr and the collection factor cf the percent of the residue not used for other things measure the approximate amount of feedstock that can be obtained for pyrolysis after harvesting the primary product for instance brazil harvests approximately 460 million tons mt of sugarcane annually 14 with an rpr of 0.30 and a cf of 0.70 for the sugarcane tops which normally are burned in the field 15 this translates into approximately 100 mt of residue annually which could be pyrolyzed to create energy and soil additives adding in the bagasse sugarcane waste rpr=0.29 cf=1.0 which is otherwise burned inefficiently in boilers raises the total to 230 mt of pyrolysis feedstock some plant residue however must remain on the soil to avoid increased costs and emissions from nitrogen fertilizers 16 pyrolysis technologies for processing loose and leafy biomass produce both biochar and syngas 17 thermo-catalytic depolymerizationedit alternatively thermo-catalytic depolymerization which utilizes microwaves has recently been used to efficiently convert organic matter to biochar on an industrial scale producing ~50 char 18 19 usesedit carbon sinkedit the burning and natural decomposition of biomass and in particular agricultural waste adds large amounts of co 2 to the atmosphere biochar that is stable fixed and recalcitrant carbon can store large amounts of greenhouse gases in the ground for centuries potentially reducing or stalling the growth in atmospheric greenhouse gas levels at the same time its presence in the earth can improve water quality increase soil fertility raise agricultural productivity and reduce pressure on old-growth forests 20 biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for hundreds to thousands of years like coal 21 22 23 24 25 such a carbon-negative technology would lead to a net withdrawal of co2 from the atmosphere while producing and consuming energy this technique is advocated by prominent scientists such as james hansen head of the nasa goddard institute for space studies 26 and james lovelock creator of the gaia hypothesis for mitigation of global warming by greenhouse gas remediation 27 researchers have estimated that sustainable use of biocharring could reduce the global net emissions of carbon dioxide co 2 methane and nitrous oxide by up to 1.8pg co 2-c equivalent co 2-ce per year  12 of current anthropogenic co 2-ce emissions 1pg=1gt and total net emissions over the course of the next century by 130pg co 2-ce without endangering food security habitat or soil conservation 28 soil amendmentedit biochar is recognised as offering a number of benefits for soil health many benefits are related to the extremely porous nature of biochar this structure is found to be very effective at retaining both water and water-soluble nutrients soil biologist elaine ingham indicates 29 the extreme suitability of biochar as a habitat for many beneficial soil micro organisms she points out that when pre charged with these beneficial organisms biochar becomes an extremely effective soil amendment promoting good soil and in turn plant health biochar has also been shown to reduce leaching of e-coli through sandy soils depending on application rate feedstock pyrolysis temperature soil moisture content soil texture and surface properties of the bacteria 30 31 32 for plants that require high potash and elevated ph 33 biochar can be used as a soil amendment to improve yield biochar can improve water quality reduce soil emissions of greenhouse gases reduce nutrient leaching reduce soil acidity and reduce irrigation and fertilizer requirements 34 biochar was also found under certain circumstances to induce plant systemic responses to foliar fungal diseases and to improve plant responses to diseases caused by soilborne pathogens 35 36 37 the various impacts of biochar can be dependent on the properties of the biochar 38 as well as the amount applied 37 and there is still a lack of knowledge about the important mechanisms and properties 39 biochar impact may depend on regional conditions including soil type soil condition depleted or healthy temperature and humidity 40 modest additions of biochar to soil reduce nitrous oxide n 2o emissions by up to 80 and eliminate methane emissions which are both more potent greenhouse gases than co2 41 studies have reported positive effects from biochar on crop production in degraded and nutrientpoor soils 42 biochar can be designed with specific qualities to target distinct properties of soils 43 biochar reduces leaching of critical nutrients creates a higher crop uptake of nutrients and provides greater soil availability of nutrients 44 at 10 levels biochar reduced contaminant levels in plants by up to 80 while reducing total chlordane and ddx content in the plants by 68 and 79 respectively 45 on the other hand because of its high adsorption capacity biochar may reduce the efficacy of soil applied pesticides that are needed for weed and pest control 46 47 high-surface-area biochars may be particularly problematic in this regard more research into the long-term effects of biochar addition to soil is needed 46 slash-and-charedit switching from slash-and-burn to slash-and-char farming techniques in brazil can decrease both deforestation of the amazon basin and carbon dioxide emission as well as increase crop yields slash-and-burn leaves only 3 of the carbon from the organic material in the soil 48 slash-and-char can keep up to 50 of the carbon in a highly stable form 49 returning the biochar into the soil rather than removing it all for energy production reduces the need for nitrogen fertilizers thereby reducing cost and emissions from fertilizer production and transport 50 additionally by improving the soils ability to be tilled fertility and productivity biocharenhanced soils can indefinitely sustain agricultural production whereas non-enriched soils quickly become depleted of nutrients forcing farmers to abandon the fields producing a continuous slash and burn cycle and the continued loss of tropical rainforest using pyrolysis to produce bio-energy also has the added benefit of not requiring infrastructure changes the way processing biomass for cellulosic ethanol does additionally the biochar produced can be applied by the currently used machinery for tilling the soil or equipment used to apply fertilizer 51 water retentionedit biochar is a desirable soil material in many locations due to its ability to attract and retain water this is possible because of its porous structure and high surface area 52 as a result nutrients phosphorus and agrochemicals are retained for the plants benefit plants therefore are healthier and fertilizers leach less into surface or groundwater energy production bio-oil and syngasedit mobile pyrolysis units can be used to lower the costs of transportation of the biomass if the biochar is returned to the soil and the syngas stream is used to power the process 53 54 bio-oil contains organic acids that are corrosive to steel containers has a high water vapor content that is detrimental to ignition and unless carefully cleaned contains some biochar particles which can block injectors 55 if biochar is used for the production of energy rather than as a soil amendment it can be directly substituted for any application that uses coal pyrolysis also may be the most cost-effective way of electricity generation from biomaterial 56 direct and indirect benefitsedit the pyrolysis of forest- or agriculture-derived biomass residue generates a biofuel without competition with crop production biochar is a pyrolysis byproduct that may be ploughed into soils in crop fields to enhance their fertility and stability and for medium- to long-term carbon sequestration in these soils biochar enhances the natural process the biosphere captures co 2 especially through plant production but only a small portion is stably sequestered for a relatively long time soil wood etc biomass production to obtain biofuels and biochar for carbon sequestration in the soil is a carbon-negative process ie more co 2 is removed from the atmosphere than released thus enabling long-term sequestration 57 researchedit intensive research into manifold aspects involving the pyrolysisbiochar platform is underway around the world from 2005 to 2012 there were 1,038 articles that included the word biochar or bio-char in the topic that had been indexed in the isi web of science 58 further research is in progress by such diverse institutions around the world as cornell university the university of edinburgh which has a dedicated research unit 59 and the agricultural research organization aro of israel volcani center where a network of researchers involved in biochar research ibrn israel biochar researchers network was established as early as 2009 students at stevens institute of technology in new jersey are developing supercapacitors that use electrodes made of biochar 60 a process developed by university of florida researchers that removes phosphate from water also yields methane gas usable as fuel and phosphate-laden carbon suitable for enriching soil 61 emerging commercial sectoredit calculations suggest that emissions reductions can be 12 to 84 greater if biochar is put back into the soil instead of being burned to offset fossil-fuel use thus biochar sequestration offers the chance to turn bioenergy into a carbon-negative industry 62 johannes lehmann of cornell university estimates that pyrolysis can be cost-effective for a combination of sequestration and energy production when the cost of a co 2 ton reaches $37 62 as of mid-february 2010 co 2 is trading at $16.82ton on the european climate exchange ecx so using pyrolysis for bioenergy production may be feasible even if it is more expensive than fossil fuel current biochar projects make no significant impact on the overall global carbon budget although expansion of this technique has been advocated as a geoengineering approach 63 in may 2009 the biochar fund received a grant from the congo basin forest fund for a project in central africa to simultaneously slow down deforestation increase the food security of rural communities provide renewable energy and sequester carboncitation needed application rates of 2.5–20 tonnes per hectare  1.0–8.1tacre appear to be required to produce significant improvements in plant yields biochar costs in developed countries vary from $300–7000tonne generally too high for the farmerhorticulturalist and prohibitive for low-input field crops in developing countries constraints on agricultural biochar relate more to biomass availability and production time an alternative is to use small amounts of biochar in lower cost biochar-fertilizer complexes 64 various companies in north america australia and england sell biochar or biochar production unitscitation needed in sweden the stockholm solution is an urban tree planting system that uses 30 biochar to support healthy growth of the urban forest the qatar aspire park now uses biochar to help trees cope with the intense heat of their summers at the 2009 international biochar conference a mobile pyrolysis unit with a specified intake of 1,000 pounds  450kg was introduced for agricultural applications the unit had a length of 12 feet and height of 7 feet  3.6 m by 2.1m 65 a production unit in dunlap tennessee by mantria corporation opened in august 2009 after testing and an initial run was later shut down as part of a ponzi scheme investigation 66 see alsoedit
