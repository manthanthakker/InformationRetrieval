uncertain due to inadequate evidence down the centuries there have been a number of accounts and hypotheses the renaissance scholar antonio de nebrija proposed that the word hispania evolved from the iberian word hispalis meaning city of the western world jesús luis cunchillos argues that the root of the term span is the phoenician word spy meaning to forge metals therefore i-spn-ya would mean the land where metals are forged 9 it may be a derivation of the phoenician i-shpania meaning island of rabbits land of rabbits or edge a reference to spains location at the end of the mediterranean roman coins struck in the region from the reign of hadrian show a female figure with a rabbit at her feet 10 and strabo called it the land of the rabbits 11 hispania may derive from the poetic use of the term hesperia reflecting the greek perception of italy as a western land or land of the setting sun hesperia ἑσπερία in greek and spain being still further west as hesperia ultima 12 there is the claim that hispania derives from the basque word ezpanna meaning edge or border another reference to the fact that the iberian peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the european continent 12 two 15th-century spanish jewish scholars don isaac abrabanel and solomon ibn verga gave an explanation now considered folkloric both men wrote in two different published works that the first jews to reach spain were brought by ship by phiros who was confederate with the king of babylon when he laid siege to jerusalem this man was a grecian by birth but who had been given a kingdom in spain he became related by marriage to espan the nephew of king heracles who also ruled over a kingdom in spain heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native greece leaving his kingdom to his nephew espan from whom the country of españa spain took its name based upon their testimonies this eponym would have already been in use in spain by c 350 bce 13 history iberia enters written records as a land populated largely by the iberians basques and celts after an arduous conquest the peninsula came under the rule of the roman empire during the early middle ages it came under germanic rule but later much of it was conquered by moorish invaders from north africa in a process that took centuries the small christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula the last moorish kingdom fell in the same year columbus reached the americas a global empire began which saw spain become the strongest kingdom in europe the leading world power for a century and a half and the largest overseas empire for three centuries continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status the napoleonic invasions of spain led to chaos triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable prior to the second world war spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy eventually democracy was peacefully restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy spain joined the european union experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth prehistory and pre-roman peoples archaeological research at atapuerca indicates the iberian peninsula was populated by hominids 1.2million years ago 15 in atapuerca fossils have been found of the earliest known hominins in europe the homo antecessor modern humans first arrived in iberia from the north on foot about 35,000 years ago 16not in citation given the best known artefacts of these prehistoric human settlements are the famous paintings in the altamira cave of cantabria in northern iberia which were created from 35,600 to 13,500 bce by cro-magnon 14 17 archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the iberian peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern europe was repopulated following the end of the last ice age the largest groups inhabiting the iberian peninsula before the roman conquest were the iberians and the celts the iberians inhabited the mediterranean side of the peninsula from the northeast to the southeast the celts inhabited much of the inner and atlantic sides of the peninsula from the northwest to the southwest basques occupied the western area of the pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas the tartessians were in the southwest and the lusitanians and vettones occupied areas in the central west a number of trading settlements of phoenicians greeks and carthaginians developed on the mediterranean coast roman empire and the gothic kingdom during the second punic war an expanding roman republic captured carthaginian trading colonies along the mediterranean coast from roughly 210 to 205bc it took the romans nearly two centuries to complete the conquest of the iberian peninsula though they had control of it for over six centuries roman rule was bound together by law language and the roman road 18 the cultures of the celtic and iberian populations were gradually romanised latinised at differing rates in different parts of hispania local leaders were admitted into the roman aristocratic classh 19 hispania served as a granary for the roman market and its harbours exported gold wool olive oil and wine agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects some of which remain in use emperors hadrian trajan theodosius i and the philosopher seneca were born in hispaniai christianity was introduced into hispania in the 1st century ad and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century ad 19 most of spains present languages and religion and the basis of its laws originate from this period 18 the weakening of the western roman empires jurisdiction in hispania began in 409 when the germanic suebi and vandals together with the sarmatian alans crossed the rhine and ravaged gaul until the visigoths drove them into iberia that same year the suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern galicia and northern portugal as the western empire disintegrated the social and economic base became greatly simplified but even in modified form the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire including christianity and assimilation to the evolving roman culture the alans allies the hasdingi vandals established a kingdom in gallaecia too occupying largely the same region but extending farther south to the douro river the silingi vandals occupied the region that still bears a form of their namevandalusia modern andalusia in spain the byzantines established an enclave spania in the south with the intention of reviving the roman empire throughout iberia eventually however hispania was reunited under visigothic rule isidore of seville archbishop of seville was an influential philosopher and was much studied in the middle ages in europe also his theories were vital to the conversion of the visigothic kingdom to a catholic one in the councils of toledo this gothic kingdom was the first christian kingdom ruling in the iberian peninsula and in the reconquista it was the referent for the different kingdoms fighting against the muslim rule middle ages muslim invasion and reconquista in the 8th century nearly all of the iberian peninsula was conquered  711–718 by largely moorish muslim armies from north africa these conquests were part of the expansion of the umayyad caliphate only a small area in the mountainous north-west of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion under islamic law christians and jews were given the subordinate status of dhimmi this status permitted christians and jews to practice their religions as people of the book but they were required to pay a special tax and had legal and social rights inferior to those of muslims 20 21 conversion to islam proceeded at an increasing pace the muladíes muslims of ethnic iberian origin are believed to have comprised the majority of the population of al-andalus by the end of the 10th century 22 23 the muslim community in the iberian peninsula was itself diverse and beset by social tensions the berber people of north africa who had provided the bulk of the invading armies clashed with the arab leadership from the middle eastj over time large moorish populations became established especially in the guadalquivir river valley the coastal plain of valencia the ebro river valley and towards the end of this period in the mountainous region of granada 23 córdoba the capital of the caliphate since abd-ar-rahman iii was the largest richest and most sophisticated city in western europe mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the middle east and north africa muslim and jewish scholars played an important part in reviving and expanding classical greek learning in western europe some important philosophers at the time were averroes ibn arabi and maimonides the romanised cultures of the iberian peninsula interacted with muslim and jewish cultures in complex ways giving the region a distinctive culture 23 outside the cities where the vast majority lived the land ownership system from roman times remained largely intact as muslim leaders rarely dispossessed landowners and the introduction of new crops and techniques led to an expansion of agriculture in the 11th century the muslim holdings fractured into rival taifa kingdoms allowing the small christian states the opportunity to greatly enlarge their territories 23 the arrival from north africa of the islamic ruling sects of the almoravids and the almohads restored unity upon the muslim holdings with a stricter less tolerant application of islam and saw a revival in muslim fortunes this re-united islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed christian gains the reconquista reconquest was the centuries-long period in which christian rule was re-established over the iberian peninsula the reconquista is viewed as beginning with the battle of covadonga won by don pelayo in 722 and was concurrent with the period of muslim rule on the iberian peninsula the christian armys victory over muslim forces led to the creation of the christian kingdom of asturias along the northwestern coastal mountains shortly after in 739 muslim forces were driven from galicia which was to eventually host one of medieval europes holiest sites santiago de compostela and was incorporated into the new christian kingdom the kingdom of león was the strongest christian kingdom for centuries in 1188 the first modern parliamentary session in europe was held in león cortes of león the kingdom of castile formed from leonese territory was its successor as strongest kingdom the kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period the example of the roman emperors influenced the political objective of the crown while the nobles benefited from feudalism muslim armies had also moved north of the pyrenees but they were defeated by frankish forces at the battle of poitiers frankia later frankish forces established christian counties on the southern side of the pyrenees these areas were to grow into the kingdoms of navarre and aragon 24 for several centuries the fluctuating frontier between the muslim and christian controlled areas of iberia was along the ebro and douro valleys the break-up of al-andalus into the competing taifa kingdoms helped the long embattled iberian christian kingdoms gain the initiative the capture of the strategically central city of toledo in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the christian kingdoms following a great muslim resurgence in the 12th century the great moorish strongholds in the south fell to christian spain in the 13th centurycórdoba in 1236 and seville in 1248 the last nasrid sultanate of granada a muslim tributary state would finally surrender in 1492 to the catholic monarchs queen isabella i of castile 25 and king ferdinand ii of aragon 26 27 28 from the mid 13th century literature and philosophy started to flourish again in the christian peninsular kingdoms based on roman and gothic traditions an important philosopher from this time is ramon llull abraham cresques was a prominent jewish cartographer roman law and its institutions were the model for the legislators the king alfonso x of castile focused on strengthening this roman and gothic past and also on linking the iberian christian kingdoms with the rest of medieval european christendom he worked for being elected emperor of the holy roman empire and published the siete partidas code the toledo school of translators is the name that commonly describes the group of scholars who worked together in the city of toledo during the 12th and 13th centuries to translate many of the philosophical and scientific works from classical arabic ancient greek and ancient hebrew the islamic transmission of the classics is the main islamic contributions to medieval europe the castilian languagemore commonly known especially later in history and at present as spanish after becoming the national language and lingua franca of spainevolved from vulgar latin as did other romance languages of spain like the catalan asturian and galician languages as well as other romance languages in latin europe basque the only non-romance language in spain continued evolving from early basque to medieval the glosas emilianenses founded in the monasteries of san millán de la cogolla contain the first written words in both basque and spanish having the first become an influence in the formation of the second as an evolution of latin in the 13th and 14th centuries the marinid muslim sect based in north africa invaded and established some enclaves on the southern coast but failed in their attempt to re-establish muslim rule in iberia and were soon driven out the 13th century also witnessed the crown of aragon centred in spains north east expand its reach across islands in the mediterranean to sicily and even athens 29 around this time the universities of palencia  1212/1263 and salamanca  1218/1254 were established the black death of 1348 and 1349 devastated spain 30 imperial spain in 1469 the crowns of the christian kingdoms of castile and aragon were united by the marriage of isabella i of castile and ferdinand ii of aragon 1478 commenced the completion of the conquest of the canary islands and in 1492 the combined forces of castile and aragon captured the emirate of granada ending the last remnant of a 781-year presence of islamic rule in iberia that same year spains jews were ordered to convert to catholicism or face expulsion from spanish territories during the spanish inquisition 31 the treaty of granada guaranteed religious tolerance towards muslims 32 and although the tolerance was only partial it was not until the beginning of the 17th century following the revolt of the alpujarras that muslims were finally expelledk 33 the year 1492 also marked the arrival of christopher columbus in the new world during a voyage funded by isabella columbuss first voyage crossed the atlantic and reached the caribbean islands beginning the european exploration and conquest of the americas although he remained convinced that he had reached the orient the colonisation of the americas started with conquistadores like hernán cortés and francisco pizarro miscegenation was the rule between the native and the european cultures and people as renaissance new monarchs isabella and ferdinand centralised royal power at the expense of local nobility and the word españa whose root is the ancient name hispania began to be commonly used to designate the whole of the two kingdoms 33 with their wide-ranging political legal religious and military reforms spain emerged as the first world power the unification of the crowns of aragon and castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern spain and the spanish empire although each kingdom of spain remained a separate country in social political laws currency and language 34 35 there were two big revolts against the new habsbourg monarch and the more authoritarian and imperial-style crown revolt of the comuneros in castile and revolt of the brotherhoods in mallorca and valencia after years of combat comuneros juan lópez de padilla juan bravo and francisco maldonado were executed and maria pacheco went into exile germana de foix also finished with the revolt in the mediterranean spain was europes leading power throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the worlds leading maritime power it reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two spanish habsburgscharles i  1516–1556 and philip ii  1556–1598 this period saw the italian wars the revolt of the comuneros the dutch revolt the morisco revolt clashes with the ottomans the anglo-spanish war and wars with france 36 through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance the spanish empire expanded to include vast areas in the americas islands in the asia-pacific area areas of italy cities in northern africa as well as parts of what are now france germany belgium luxembourg and the netherlands the first circumnavigation of the world was carried out in 1519–1521 it was the first empire on which it was said that the sun never set this was an age of discovery with daring explorations by sea and by land the opening-up of new trade routes across oceans conquests and the beginnings of european colonialism spanish explorers brought back precious metals spices luxuries and previously unknown plants and played a leading part in transforming the european understanding of the globe 37 the cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the spanish golden age the expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from europe devastated american indigenous populations the rise of humanism the counter-reformation and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the school of salamanca which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as international law and human rights in the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century spain was confronted by unrelenting challenges from all sides barbary pirates under the aegis of the rapidly growing ottoman empire disrupted life in many coastal areas through their slave raids and the renewed threat of an islamic invasion 38 this was at a time when spain was often at war with france the protestant reformation dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars the result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across europe and in the mediterranean 39 by the middle decades of a war- and plague-ridden 17th-century europe the spanish habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent-wide religious-political conflicts these conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered habsburg empire and help the imperial forces of the holy roman empire reverse a large part of the advances made by protestant forces but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of portugal with whom it had been united in a personal union of the crowns from 1580 to 1640 and the netherlands and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to france in the latter stages of the immensely destructive europe-wide thirty years war 40 in the latter half of the 17th century spain went into a gradual decline during which it surrendered several small territories to france and the netherlands however it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century the decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century the war of the spanish succession was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war and was to cost the kingdom its european possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the continent 41 during this war a new dynasty originating in france the bourbons was installed long united only by the crown a true spanish state was established when the first bourbon king philip v united the crowns of castile and aragon into a single state abolishing many of the old regional privileges and laws 42 the 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire the new bourbon monarchy drew on the french system of modernising the administration and the economy enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdoms elite and monarchy military assistance for the rebellious british colonies in the american war of independence improved the kingdoms international standing 43 liberalism and nation state in 1793 spain went to war against the revolutionary new french republic as a member of the first coalition the subsequent war of the pyrenees polarised the country in a reaction against the gallicised elites and following defeat in the field peace was made with france in 1795 at the peace of basel in which spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of hispaniola the prime minister manuel godoy then ensured that spain allied herself with france in the brief war of the third coalition which ended with the british victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805 in 1807 a secret treaty between napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against britain and portugal napoleons troops entered the country to invade portugal but instead occupied spains major fortresses the ridiculed spanish king abdicated in favour of napoleons brother joseph bonaparte joseph bonaparte was seen as a puppet monarch and was regarded with scorn by the spanish the 2 may 1808 revolt was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the bonapartist regime 44 these revolts marked the beginning of a devastating war of independence against the napoleonic regime 45 napoleon was forced to intervene personally defeating several spanish armies and forcing a british army to retreat however further military action by spanish armies guerrillas and wellingtons british-portuguese forces combined with napoleons disastrous invasion of russia led to the ousting of the french imperial armies from spain in 1814 and the return of king ferdinand vii 46 during the war in 1810 a revolutionary body the cortes of cádiz was assembled to co-ordinate the effort against the bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution 47 it met as one body and its members represented the entire spanish empire 48 in 1812 a constitution for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared but after the fall of the bonapartist regime ferdinand vii dismissed the cortes generales and was determined to rule as an absolute monarch these events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries spains conquest by france benefited latin american anti-colonialists who resented the imperial spanish governments policies that favoured spanish-born citizens peninsulars over those born overseas criollos and demanded retroversion of the sovereignty to the people starting in 1809 spains american colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence leading to the spanish american wars of independence that ended spanish control over its mainland colonies in the americas king ferdinand viis attempt to re-assert control proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in spain and army revolts followed led by liberal officers by the end of 1826 the only american colonies spain held were cuba and puerto rico the napoleonic war left spain economically ruined deeply divided and politically unstable in the 1830s and 1840s anti-liberal forces known as carlists fought against liberals in the carlist wars liberal forces won but the conflict between progressive and conservative liberals ended in a weak early constitutional period after the glorious revolution of 1868 and the short-lived first spanish republic a more stable monarchic period began characterised by the practice of turnismo the rotation of government control between progressive and conservative liberals within the spanish government in the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the philippines and cuba in 1895 and 1896 the cuban war of independence and the philippine revolution broke out and eventually the united states became involved the spanishamerican war was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of north africa el desastre the disaster as the war became known in spain gave added impetus to the generation of 98 who were conducting an analysis of the country although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity the 20th century brought little peace spain played a minor part in the scramble for africa with the colonisation of western sahara spanish morocco and equatorial guinea it remained neutral during world war i see spain in world war i the heavy losses suffered during the rif war in morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy a period of authoritarian rule under general miguel primo de rivera  1923–1931 ended with the establishment of the second spanish republic the republic offered political autonomy to the linguistically distinct regions of basque country catalonia and galicia and gave voting rights to women clara campoamor suffragette leader victoria kent or dolores ibarruri were some of the first female deputies and federica montseny one of the first femlae ministers in the world in the worsening economic situation of the great depression spanish politics became increasingly chaotic and violent spanish civil war and dictatorship the spanish civil war broke out in 1936 for three years the nationalist forces led by general francisco franco and supported by nazi germany and fascist italy fought the republican side which was supported by the soviet union mexico and international brigades but it was not supported by the western powers due to the british-led policy of non-intervention the civil war was viciously fought and there were many atrocities committed by all sides the war claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country 49 50 in 1939 general franco emerged victorious and became a dictator the state as established under franco was nominally neutral in the second world war although sympathetic to the axis the only legal party under francos post civil war regime was the falange española tradicionalista y de las jons formed in 1937 the party emphasised falangism a form of fascism that emphasised anti-communism nationalism and roman catholicism given francos opposition to competing political parties the party was renamed the national movement movimiento nacional in 1949 after world war ii spain was politically and economically isolated and was kept out of the united nations this changed in 1955 during the cold war period when it became strategically important for the us to establish a military presence on the iberian peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the soviet union into the mediterranean basin in the 1960s spain registered an unprecedented rate of economic growth which was propelled by industrialisation a mass internal migration from rural areas to cities and the creation of a mass tourism industry francos rule was also characterised by authoritarianism promotion of a unitary national identity the favouring of a very conservative form of roman catholicism known as national catholicism and discriminatory language policies restoration of democracy in 1962 salvador de madariaga founder of the liberal international and the college of europe met in the congress of the european movement in munich with members of the opposition to francos regime inside the country and in the exile there were 118 politicians from all factions at the end of the meetings a resolution in favour of democracy was made 51 52 53 with francos death in november 1975 juan carlos succeeded to the position of king of spain and head of state in accordance with the law with the approval of the new spanish constitution of 1978 and the restoration of democracy the state devolved much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on autonomous communities in the basque country moderate basque nationalism has coexisted with a radical nationalist movement led by the armed terrorist organisation eta 54 the group was formed in 1959 during francos rule but has continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy on 23 february 1981 rebel elements among the security forces seized the cortes in an attempt to impose a military backed government king juan carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters via national television to surrender during the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society new cultural movements based on freedom appeared like la movida madrileña and a culture of human rights arose with gregorio peces-barba on 30 may 1982 spain joined nato following a referendum that year the spanish socialist workers party psoe came to power the first left-wing government in 43 years in 1986 spain joined the european economic community which later became the european union the psoe was replaced in government by the partido popular pp after the latter won the 1996 general elections at that point the psoe had served almost 14 consecutive years in office on 1 january 2002 spain fully adopted the euro and spain experienced strong economic growth well above the eu average during the early 2000s however well publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom warned that extraordinary property prices and a high foreign trade deficit were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse 55 on 11 march 2004 a local islamist terrorist group inspired by al-qaeda carried out the largest terrorist attack in spanish history when they killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 others by bombing commuter trains in madrid 56 though initial suspicions focused on the basque terrorist group eta evidence soon emerged indicating islamist involvement because of the proximity of the 2004 election the issue of responsibility quickly became a political controversy with the main competing parties pp and psoe exchanging accusations over the handling of the incident 57 at 14 march elections psoe led by josé luis rodríguez zapatero obtained a plurality enough to form a new cabinet with rodríguez zapatero as the new presidente del gobierno or prime minister of spain thus succeeding the former pp administration 58 the proportion of spains foreign born population increased rapidly from around 1 in 50 in 2000 to almost 1 in 8 in 2010 but has since declined in 2005 the spanish government legalised same sex marriage the bursting of the spanish property bubble in 2008 led to the 2008–15 spanish financial crisis and high levels of unemployment cuts in government spending and catalan independentism served as a backdrop to the 2011–12 spanish protests in 2011 mariano rajoys conservative peoples party won elections with 44.6 of votes and rajoy became the spanish prime minister after having been the leader of the opposition from 2004 to 2011 on 19 june 2014 the monarch juan carlos abdicated in favour of his son who became

islands on the mediterranean side of the strait of gibraltar known as plazas de soberanía places of sovereignty or territories under spanish sovereignty such as the chafarinas islands and alhucemas the peninsula of vélez de la gomera is also regarded as a plaza de soberanía the isle of alborán located in the mediterranean between spain and north africa is also administered by spain specifically by the municipality of almería andalusia the little pheasant island in the river bidasoa is a spanish-french condominium largest inhabited islands of spain mountains and rivers mainland spain is a mountainous country dominated by high plateaus and mountain chains after the pyrenees the main mountain ranges are the cordillera cantábrica cantabrian range sistema ibérico iberian system sistema central central system montes de toledo sierra morena and the sistema bético baetic system whose highest peak the 3,478m high mulhacén located in sierra nevada is the highest elevation in the iberian peninsula the highest point in spain is the teide a 3,718-metre  12,198ft active volcano in the canary islands the meseta central often translated as inner plateau is a vast plateau in the heart of peninsular spain there are several major rivers in spain such as the tagus tajo ebro guadiana douro duero guadalquivir júcar segura turia and minho miño alluvial plains are found along the coast the largest of which is that of the guadalquivir in andalusia climate three main climatic zones can be separated according to geographical situation and orographic conditions 59 60 61 the mediterranean climate characterised by warmhot and dry summers it is dominant in the peninsula with two varieties csa and csb according to the köppen climate classification the csb zone has warm rather than hot summers and extends to additional cool-winter areas not typically associated with a mediterranean climate such as much of central and northern-central of spain eg léon or ávila and into much ranier areas notably galicia the semi-arid climate bsh bsk located in the southeastern quarter of the country especially in the region of murcia and in the ebro valley the dry season extends beyond the summer the oceanic climate cfb located in the northern quarter of the country especially in the region of basque country cantabria asturias and partly galicia winter and summer temperatures are influenced by the ocean and have no seasonal drought apart from these main types other sub-types can be found like the alpine climate in the pyrenees and sierra nevada and a typical desert climate in the zone of almería murcia and in most of the canary islands low-lying areas of the canary islands average above 18.0c  64.4f during their coldest month thus having a tropical climate the below-listed list covers the average temperatures of the largest cities in three different parts of spain madrid central peninsula barcelona mediterranean coast and bilbao north coast santa cruz de tenerife which has a significantly different climates to the predominant climate in spain more information regarding temperature can be found in city articles and the main article about the spanish climate fauna and flora the fauna presents a wide diversity that is due in large part to the geographical position of the iberian peninsula between the atlantic and the mediterranean and between africa and eurasia and the great diversity of habitats and biotopes the result of a considerable variety of climates and well differentiated regions the vegetation of spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the relief the climate and latitude spain includes different phytogeographic regions each with its own floristic characteristics resulting largely from the interaction of climate topography soil type and fire biotic factors politics according to the democracy index of the eiu spain is one of the 20 full democracies in the world the spanish constitution of 1978 is the culmination of the spanish transition to democracy the constitutional history of spain dates back to the constitution of 1812 impatient with the slow pace of democratic political reforms in 1976 and 1977 spains new king juan carlos known for his formidable personality dismissed carlos arias navarro and appointed the reformer adolfo suárez as prime minister 63 64 the resulting general election in 1977 convened the constituent cortes the spanish parliament in its capacity as a constitutional assembly for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978 65 after a national referendum on 6 december 1978 88 of voters approved of the new constitution as a result spain is now composed of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities with varying degrees of autonomy thanks to its constitution which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the spanish nation the constitution also specifies that spain has no state religion and that all are free to practice and believe as they wish the spanish administration approved legislation in 2007 aimed at furthering equality between genders in spanish political and economic life gender equality act 66 67 however in the legislative branch as of july 2010 only 128 of the 350 members of the congress were women  36.3 68 it places spain 13th on a list of countries ranked by proportion of women in the lower house in the senate the ratio is even lower since there are only 79 women out of 263  30.0 69 the gender empowerment measure of spain in the united nations human development report is 0.794 12th in the world 70 government spain is a constitutional monarchy with a hereditary monarch and a bicameral parliament the cortes generales general courts the executive branch consists of a council of ministers of spain presided over by the prime minister nominated and appointed by the monarch and confirmed by the congress of deputies following legislative elections by political custom established

one of the most decentralised countries in europe along with switzerland germany and belgium 71 for example all autonomous communities have their own elected parliaments governments public administrations budgets and resources health and education systems among others are managed regionally and in addition the basque country and navarre also manage their own public finances based on foral provisions in catalonia the basque country navarre and the canary islands a full-fledged autonomous police corps replaces some of the state police functions see mossos desquadra ertzaintza policía foral and policía canaria human rights the government respects the human rights of its citizens although there are a few problems in some areas the law and judiciary provide effective means of addressing individual instances of abuse there are allegations that a few members of the security forces abused detainees and mistreated foreigners and illegal immigrantscitation needed according to amnesty international ai government investigations of such alleged abuses are often lengthy and punishments were lightcitation needed violence against women was a problem which the government took steps to addresscitation needed spain provides one of the highest degrees of liberty in the world for its lgbt community among the countries studied by pew research center in 2013 spain is rated first in acceptance of homosexuality with an 88 of society supporting the gay community compared to 11 who do not 72 administrative divisions the spanish state is integrated by 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities both groups being the highest or first-order administrative division in the country autonomous communities are integrated by provinces of which there are 50 in total and in turn provinces are integrated by municipalities in catalonia two additional divisions exist the comarques sing comarca and the vegueries sing vegueria both of which have administrative powers comarques being aggregations of municipalities and the vegueries being aggregations of comarques the concept of a comarca exists in all autonomous communities however unlike catalonia these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions autonomous regions spains autonomous regions are the first level administrative divisions of the country they were created after the current constitution came into effect in 1978 in recognition of the right to self-government of the nationalities and regions of spain 73 the autonomous regions were to be integrated into adjacent provinces with common historical cultural and economical traits this territorial organisation based on devolution is literally known in spain as the state of autonomies the basic institutional law of each autonomous region is the statute of autonomy the statutes of autonomy establish the name of the region according to its historical identity the limits of its territories the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution 74 the governments of all autonomous regions must be based on a division of powers comprising a legislative assembly whose members must be elected by universal suffrage according to the system of proportional representation and in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented a government council with executive and administrative functions headed by a president elected by the legislative assembly and nominated by the king of spain a supreme court under the supreme court of spain which heads the judiciary in the autonomous region catalonia galicia and the basque country which identified themselves as nationalities were granted self-government through a rapid process andalusia also took that denomination in its first statute of autonomy even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country progressively other communities in revisions to their statutes of autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical regional identity such as the valencian community 75 the canary islands 76 the balearic islands 77 and aragon 78 the autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy with their own parliaments and regional governments the distribution of powers may be different for every community as laid out in their statutes of autonomy since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical only two communitiesthe basque country and navarrehave full fiscal autonomy aside of fiscal autonomy the historical nationalitiesandalusia the basque country catalonia and galiciawere devolved more powers than the rest of the communities among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time in addition the basque country catalonia and navarre have police corps of their own ertzaintza mossos desquadra and the policía foral respectively other communities have more limited forces or none at all like the policía autónoma andaluza 79 in andalusia or the bescam in madrid nonetheless recent amendments to existing statutes of autonomy or the promulgation of new statutes altogether have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the historical nationalities and the rest of the regions finally along with the 17 autonomous communities two autonomous cities are also part of the state of autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions ceuta and melilla these are two exclaves located in the northern african coast provinces and municipalities autonomous communities are subdivided into provinces which served as their territorial building blocks in turn provinces are integrated by municipalities the existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution not necessarily by the statutes of autonomy themselves municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the state 80 the current provincial division structure is basedwith minor changeson the 1833 territorial division by javier de burgos and in all the spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces the communities of asturias cantabria la rioja the balearic islands madrid murcia and navarre are the only communities that are integrated by a single province which is coextensive with the community itself in these cases the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community foreign relations after the return of democracy following the death of franco in 1975 spains foreign policy priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the franco years and expand diplomatic relations enter the european community and define security relations with the west as a member of nato since 1982 spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities spains eu membership represents an important part of its foreign policy even on many international issues beyond western europe spain prefers to co-ordinate its efforts with its eu partners through the european political co-operation mechanismsvague spain has maintained its special relations with hispanic america and the philippines its policy emphasises the concept of an ibero-american community essentially the renewal of the historically liberal concept of hispanidad or hispanismo as it is often referred to in english which has sought to link the iberian peninsula with hispanic america through language commerce history and culture spain claims gibraltar a 6-square-kilometre  2.3sqmi overseas territory of the united kingdom in the southernmost part of the iberian peninsula then a spanish town it was conquered by an anglo-dutch force in 1704 during the war of the spanish succession on behalf of archduke charles pretender to the spanish throne the legal situation concerning gibraltar was settled in 1713 by the treaty of utrecht in which spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to the british crown 81 stating that should the british abandon this post it would be offered to spain first since the 1940s spain has called for the return of gibraltar the overwhelming majority of gibraltarians strongly oppose this along with any proposal of shared sovereignty 82 un resolutions call on the united kingdom and spain both eu members to reach an agreement over the status of gibraltar 83 84 the spanish claim makes a distinction between the isthmus that connects the rock to the spanish mainland on the one hand and the rock and city of gibraltar on the other while the rock and city were ceded by the treaty of utrecht spain asserts that the occupation of the isthmus is illegal and against the principles of international law 85 the united kingdom relies on de facto arguments of possession by prescription in relation to the isthmus 86 as there has been continuous possession of the isthmus over a long period 87 another claim by spain is about the savage islands a claim not recognised by portugal spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands therefore claiming that there is no portuguese territorial waters around the disputed islands on 5 july 2013 spain sent a letter to the un expressing these views 89 90 spain claims the sovereignty over the perejil island a small uninhabited rocky islet located in the south shore of the strait of gibraltar the island lies 250 metres  820ft just off the coast of morocco 8 kilometres  5.0mi from ceuta and 13.5 kilometres  8.4mi from mainland spain its sovereignty is disputed between spain and morocco it was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002 the incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the moroccan occupation of the island the islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty besides the perejil island the spanish-held territories claimed by other countries are two morocco claims the spanish cities of ceuta and melilla and the plazas de soberanía islets off the northern coast of africa and portugal does not recognise spains sovereignty over the territory of olivenza military the armed forces of spain are known as the spanish armed forces fuerzas armadas españolas their commander-in-chief is the king of spain felipe vi 91 the spanish armed forces are divided into three branches 92 army ejército de tierra navy armada air force ejército del aire economy spains capitalist mixed economy is the 16th largest worldwide and the 5th largest in the european union as well as the eurozones 4th largest the centre-right government of former prime minister josé maría aznar worked successfully to gain admission to the group of countries launching the euro in 1999 unemployment stood at 7.6 in october 2006 a rate that compared favourably to many other european countries and especially with the early 1990s when it stood at over 20 perennial weak points of spains economy include high inflation 93 a large underground economy 94 and an education system which oecd reports place among the poorest for developed countries together with the united states and uk 95 by the mid-1990s the economy had recommenced the growth that had been disrupted by the global recession of the early 1990s the strong economic growth helped the government to reduce the government debt as a percentage of gdp and spains high unemployment began to drop steadily with the government budget in balance and inflation under control spain was admitted into the eurozone in 1999 since the 1990s some spanish companies have gained multinational status often expanding their activities in culturally close latin america spain is the second biggest foreign investor there after the united states spanish companies have also expanded into asia especially china and india 96 this early global expansion is a competitive advantage over its competitors and european neighbours the reason for this early expansion is the booming interest towards spanish language and culture in asia and africa and a corporate culture that learned to take risks in unstable markets spanish companies invested in fields like renewable energy commercialisation iberdrola was the worlds largest renewable energy operator 97 technology companies like telefónica abengoa mondragon corporation movistar hisdesat indra train manufacturers like caf talgo global corporations such as the textile company inditex petroleum companies like repsol and infrastructure with six of the ten biggest international construction firms specialising in transport being spanish like ferrovial acciona acs ohl and fcc 98 in 2005 the economist intelligence units quality of life survey placed spain among the top 10 in the world 102 in 2013 the same survey now called the where-to-be-born index ranked spain 28th in the world 103 in 2010 the basque city of bilbao was awarded with the lee kuan yew world city prize 104 and its mayor at the time iñaki azkuna was awarded the world mayor prize in 2012 105 the basque capital city of vitoria-gasteiz received the european green capital award in 2012 106 agriculture crop areas were farmed in two highly diverse manners areas relying on non-irrigated cultivation secano which made up 85 of the entire crop area depended solely on rainfall as a source of water they included the humid regions of the north and the northwest as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated the much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation regadío accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986 and the government hoped that this area would eventually double as it already had doubled since 1950 particularly noteworthy was the development in almeríaone of the most arid and desolate provinces of spainof winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to europe though only about 17 of spains cultivated land was irrigated it was estimated to be the source of between 40-45 of the gross value of crop production and of 50 of the value of agricultural exports more than half of the irrigated area was planted in corn fruit trees and vegetables other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes cotton sugar beets potatoes legumes olive trees mangos strawberries tomatoes and fodder grasses depending on the nature of the crop it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10 of the countrys irrigated land citrus fruits vegetables cereal grains olive oil and winespains traditional agricultural productscontinued to be important in the 1980s in 1983 they represented 12 12 8 6 and 4 respectively of the countrys agricultural production because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock poultry and dairy products meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity accounting for 30 of all farm-related production in 1983 increased attention to livestock was the reason that spain became a net importer of grains ideal growing conditions combined with proximity to important north european markets made citrus fruits spains leading export fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities as did sunflower seed oil that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the mediterranean countries of the ec tourism the climate of spain its geographic location popular coastlines diverse landscapes historical legacy vibrant culture and excellent infrastructure has made spains international tourist industry among the largest in the world in the last five decades international tourism in spain has grown to become the second largest in the world in terms of spending worth approximately 40billion euros or about 5 of gdp in 2006 107 108 energy spain is one of the worlds leading countries in the development and production of renewable energy in 2010 spain became the solar power world leader when it overtook the united states with a massive power station plant called la florida near alvarado badajoz 110 111 spain is also europes main producer of wind energy in 2010 its wind turbines generated 42,976 gwh which accounted for 16.4 of all electrical energy produced in spain 112 113 114 on 9 november 2010 wind energy reached an instantaneous historic peak covering 53 of mainland electricity demand 115 and generating an amount of energy that is equivalent to that of 14 nuclear reactors 116 other renewable energies used in spain are hydroelectric biomass and marine  2 power plants under construction 117 non-renewable energy sources used in spain are nuclear  8 operative reactors gas coal and oil fossil fuels together generated 58 of spains electricity in 2009 just below the oecd mean of 61 nuclear power generated another 19 and wind and hydro about 12 each 118 transport the spanish road system is mainly centralised with six highways connecting madrid to the basque country catalonia valencia west andalusia extremadura and galicia additionally there are highways along the atlantic ferrol to vigo cantabrian oviedo to san sebastián and mediterranean girona to cádiz coasts spain aims to put onemillion electric cars on the road by 2014 as part of the governments plan to save energy and boost energy efficiency 119 the minister of industry miguel sebastian said that the electric vehicle is the future and the engine of an industrial revolution 120 spain has the most extensive high-speed rail network in europe and the second-most extensive in the world after china 121 122 as of october 2010 spain has a total of 3,500km  2,174.80mi of high-speed tracks linking málaga seville madrid barcelona valencia and valladolid with the trains reaching speeds up to 300kmh  190mph on average the spanish high-speed train is the fastest one in the world followed by the japanese bullet train and the french tgv 123 regarding punctuality it is second in the world  98.54 on-time arrival after the japanese shinkansen  99 124 should the aims of the ambitious ave programme spanish high speed trains be met by 2020 spain will have 7,000km  4,300mi of high-speed trains linking almost all provincial cities to madrid in less than three hours and barcelona within four hours there are 47 public airports in spain the busiest one is the airport of madrid barajas with 50million passengers in 2011 being the worlds 15th busiest airport as well as the european unions fourth busiest the airport of barcelona el prat is also important with 35million passengers in 2011 being the worlds 31st-busiest airport other main airports are located in majorca  23million passengers málaga  13million passengers las palmas gran canaria  11million passengers alicante  10million passengers and smaller with the number of passengers between 4 and 10 million for example tenerife two airports valencia seville bilbao ibiza lanzarote fuerteventura also more than 30 airports with the number of passengers below 4 million science and technology in the 19th and 20th centuries science in spain was held back by severe political instability and consequent economic underdevelopment despite the conditions some important scientists and engineers emerged the most notable were miguel servet santiago ramón y cajal narcís monturiol celedonio calatayud juan de la cierva leonardo torres y quevedo margarita salas and severo ochoa water supply and sanitation water supply and sanitation in spain is characterised by universal access and generally good service quality while tariffs are among the lowest in the eu 125 almost half of the population is served by private or mixed private-public water companies which operate under concession contracts with municipalities the largest of the private water companies with a market share of about 50 of the private concessions is aguas de barcelona agbar however the large cities are all served by public companies except barcelona and valencia the largest public company is canal de isabel ii which serves the metropolitan area of madrid droughts affect water supply in southern spain which increasingly is turning towards seawater desalination to meet its water needs demographics in 2008 the population of spain officially reached 46million people as recorded by the padrón municipal spains municipal register 126 spains population density at 91km  235sq mi is lower than that of most western european countries and its distribution across the country is very unequal with the exception of the region surrounding the capital madrid the most populated areas lie around the coast the population of spain more than doubled since 1900 when it stood at 18.6 million principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s 127 native spaniards make up 88 of the total population of spain after the birth rate plunged in the 1980s and spains population growth rate dropped the population again trended upward based initially on the return of many spaniards who had emigrated to other european countries during the 1970s and more recently fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12 of the population the immigrants originate mainly in latin america  39 north africa  16 eastern europe  15 and sub-saharan africa  4 128 in 2005 spain instituted a three-month amnesty programme through which certain hitherto undocumented aliens were granted legal residency in 2008 spain granted citizenship to 84,170 persons mostly to people from ecuador colombia and morocco 129 a sizeable portion of foreign residents in spain also comes from other western and central european countries these are mostly british french german dutch and norwegian they reside primarily on the mediterranean coast and the balearic islands where many choose to live their retirement or telecommute substantial populations descended from spanish colonists and immigrants exist in other parts of the world most notably in latin america beginning in the late 15th century large numbers of iberian colonists settled in what became latin america and at present most white latin americans who make up about one-third of latin americas population are of spanish or portuguese origin around 240,000 spaniards emigrated in the 16th century mostly to peru and mexico 130 another 450,000 left in the 17th century 131 between 1846 and 1932 it is estimated that nearly 5million spaniards emigrated to the americas especially to argentina and brazil 132 approximately two million spaniards migrated to other western european countries between 1960 and 1975 during the same period perhaps 300,000 went to latin america 133 urbanisation v t e metropolitan areas and functional urban areas 134 source áreas urbanas +50 ministry of public works and transport  2013 135 peoples the spanish constitution of 1978 in its second article recognises historic entitiesnationalities a carefully chosen word to avoid the more politically charged nationsand regions within the context of the spanish nation for some people spains identity consists more of an overlap of different regional identities than of a sole spanish identity indeed some of the regional identities may even conflict with the spanish one distinct traditional regional identities within spain include the basques catalans galicians andalusians and valencians 140 although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities will claim a distinct historic identity it is this last feature of shared identity between the more local level or autonomous community and the spanish level which makes the identity question in spain complex and far from univocal minority groups spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies especially latin america and north africa smaller numbers of immigrants from several sub-saharan countries have recently been settling in spain there are also sizeable numbers of asian immigrants most of whom are of middle eastern south asian and chinese origin the single largest group of immigrants are european represented by large numbers of britons germans french and others 141 the arrival of the gitanos a romani people began in the 16th century estimates of the spanish gitano population range from 750,000 to over one million 142 143 144 145 146 there are also the mercheros also quinquis a formerly nomadic minority group their origin is unclear historically sephardi jews and moriscos are the main minority groups originated in spain and with a contribution to spanish culture 147 the spanish government is offering spanish nationality to sephardi jews 148 immigration according to the spanish government there were 5.7million foreign residents in spain in 2011 or 12 of the total population according to residence permit data for 2011 more than 860,000 were romanian about 770,000 were moroccan approximately 390,000 were british and 360,000 were ecuadorian 149 other sizeable foreign communities are colombian bolivian german italian bulgarian and chinese there are more than 200,000 migrants from sub-saharan africa living in spain principally senegaleses and nigerians 150 since 2000 spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level this sudden and ongoing inflow of immigrants particularly those arriving illegally by sea has caused noticeable social tension 151 within the eu spain had the 2nd highest immigration rate in percentage terms after cyprus but by a great margin the highest in absolute numbers up to 2008 152 the number of immigrants in spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2million in 2008 out of a total population of 46million 153 154 in 2005 alone a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people 155 there are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration including spains cultural ties with latin america its geographical position the porosity of its borders the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of eu origin typically retiring to spains mediterranean coast in fact spain was europes largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007 with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2.5million people arrived 156 in 2008 prior to the onset of the economic crisis the financial times reported that spain was the most favoured destination for western europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the eu 157 in 2008 the government instituted a plan of voluntary return which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the eu to return to their home countries and receive several incentives including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the spanish social security 158 the programme had little effect during its first two months just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer 159 what the programme failed to do the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs in 2011 alone more than half a million people left spain 160 for the first time in decades the net migration rate was expected to be negative and nine out of 10 emigrants were foreigners 160 languages spain is openly multilingual 161 and the constitution establishes that the nation will protect all spaniards and the peoples of spain in the exercise of human rights their cultures and traditions languages and institutions 162 spanish españolofficially recognised in the constitution as castilian castellanois the official language of the entire country and it is the right and duty of every spaniard to know the language the constitution also establishes that all other spanish languagesthat is all other languages of spainwill also be official in their respective autonomous communities in accordance to their statutes their organic regional legislations and that the richness of the distinct linguistic modalities of spain represents a patrimony which will be the object of special respect and protection 163 the other official languages of spain co-official with spanish are basque euskara in the basque country and navarre catalan català in catalonia the balearic islands and in the valencian community where its distinct modality of the language is officially known as valencian valencià and galician galego in galicia as a percentage of the general population basque is spoken by 2 catalan or valencian by 17 and galician by 7 of all spaniards 164 in catalonia aranese aranés a local variety of the occitan language has been declared co-official along with catalan and spanish since 2006 it is spoken only in the comarca of val daran by roughly 6,700 people other romance minority languages though not official have special recognition such as the astur-leonese group asturian  asturianu also called bable  in asturias 165 and leonese  llionés  in castile and león and aragonese aragonés in aragon in the north african spanish autonomous city of melilla riff berber is spoken by a significant part of the population in the tourist areas of the mediterranean coast and the islands

african countries more than 514,000  30 of them had spanish nationality 176 the recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of hindus buddhists sikhs and muslims after the reconquista in 1492 muslims did not live in spain for centuries late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern africa gave a number of residents in spanish morocco and western sahara full citizenship their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration especially from morocco and algeria judaism was practically non-existent in spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century when jews were again permitted to enter the country currently there are around 62,000 jews in spain or 0.14 of the total population most are arrivals in the past century while some are descendants of

literature the earliest recorded examples of vernacular romance-based literature date from the same time and location the rich mix of muslim jewish and christian cultures in muslim spain in which maimonides averroes and others worked the kharjas jarchas during the reconquista the epic poem cantar de mio cid was written about a real manhis battles conquests and daily life other major plays from the medieval times were mester de juglaría mester de clerecía coplas por la muerte de su padre or el libro de buen amor the book of good love during the renaissance the major plays are la celestina and el lazarillo de tormes while many religious literature was created with poets as luis de león san juan de la cruz santa teresa de jesús etc the baroque is the most important period for spanish culture we are in the times of the spanish empire the famous don quijote de la mancha by miguel de cervantes was written in this time other writers from the period are francisco de quevedo lope de vega calderón de la barca or tirso de molina during the enlightenment we find names such as leandro fernández de moratín benito jerónimo feijóo gaspar melchor de jovellanos or leandro fernández de moratín during the romanticism josé zorrilla created one of the most emblematic figures in european literature in don juan tenorio other writers from this period are gustavo adolfo bécquer josé de espronceda rosalía de castro or mariano josé de larra in realism we find names such as benito pérez galdós emilia pardo bazán leopoldo alas clarín concepción arenal vicente blasco ibáñez and menéndez pelayo realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society as they were in the spirit of general realism realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences instead of romanticised or stylised presentations the group that has become known as the generation of 1898 was marked by the destruction of spains fleet in cuba by us gunboats in 1898 which provoked a cultural crisis in spain the disaster of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political economic and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of regeneracionismo for a group of younger writers among them miguel de unamuno pío baroja and josé martínez ruiz azorín the disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper more radical literary shift that affected both form and content these writers along with ramón del valle-inclán antonio machado ramiro de maeztu and ángel ganivet came to be known as the generation of 98 the generation of 1914 or novecentismo the next supposed generation of spanish writers following those of '98 already calls into question the value of such terminology by the year 1914the year of the outbreak of the first world war and of the publication of the first major work of the generations leading voice josé ortega y gasseta number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the spanish cultural field leading voices include the poet juan ramón jiménez the academics and essayists ramón menéndez pidal gregorio marañón manuel azaña maria zambrano eugeni dors clara campoamor and ortega y gasset and the novelists gabriel miró ramón pérez de ayala and ramón gómez de la serna while still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of '98 they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity salvador de madariaga another prominent intellectual and writer was one of the founders of the college of europe and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the liberal international the generation of 1927 where poets pedro salinas jorge guillén federico garcía lorca vicente aleixandre dámaso alonso all were scholars of their national literary heritage again evidence of the impact of the calls of regeneracionistas and the generation of 1898 for spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards the two main writers in the second half of the 20th century were the nobel prize in literature laureate camilo josé cela and miguel delibes from generation of '36 spain is one of the countries with the most number of laureates with the nobel prize in literature and with latin american laureates they made the spanish language literature one of the most laureates of all the spanish writers are josé echegaray jacinto benavente juan ramón jiménez vicente aleixandre and camilo josé cela the portuguese writer josé saramago also awarded with the prize lived for many years in spain and spoke both portuguese and spanish he was also well known by his iberist ideas the generation of '50 are also known as the children of the civil war rosa chacel gloria fuertes jaime gil de biedma juan goytisolo carmen martin gaite ana maria matute juan marsé blas de otero gabriel celaya antonio gamoneda rafael sánchez ferlosio or ignacio aldecoa art artists from spain have been highly influential in the development of various european artistic movements due to historical geographical and generational diversity spanish art has known a great number of influences the moorish heritage in spain especially in andalusia is still evident today and european influences include italy germany and france especially during the baroque and neoclassical periods during the golden age we find painters such as el greco josé de ribera bartolomé esteban murillo and francisco zurbarán also inside baroque period diego velázquez created some of the most famous spanish portraits like las meninas or las hilanderas francisco goya painted during a historical period that includes the spanish independence war the fights between liberals and absolutists and the raise of state-nations joaquín sorolla is a well-known impressionist painter and there are many important spanish painters belonging to the modernism art movement including pablo picasso salvador dalí juan gris and joan miró sculpture the plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great spanish artists of the time alonso berruguete valladolid school is called the prince of spanish sculpture his main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the cathedral of toledo the tomb of cardinal tavera in the same cathedral and the altarpiece of the visitation in the church of santa úrsula in the same locality other notable sculptors were bartolomé ordóñez diego de siloé juan de juni and damián forment there were two schools of special flair and talent the seville school to which juan martínez montañés belonged whose most celebrated works are the crucifix in the cathedral of seville another in vergara and a saint john and the granada school to which alonso cano belonged to whom an immaculate conception and a virgin of rosary are attributed other notable andalusian baroque sculptors were pedro de mena pedro roldán and his daughter luisa roldán juan de mesa and pedro

montiel and penélope cruz or actor antonio banderas are among those who have become hollywood stars architecture due to its historical and geographical diversity spanish architecture has drawn from a host of influences an important provincial city founded by the romans and with an extensive roman era infrastructure córdoba became the cultural capital including fine arabic style architecture during the time of the islamic umayyad dynasty 181 later arab style architecture continued to be developed under successive islamic dynasties ending with the nasrid which built its famed palace complex in granada simultaneously the christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles developing a pre-romanesque style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream european architectural influences during the earlier middle ages they later integrated the romanesque and gothic streams there was then an extraordinary flowering of the gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory the mudéjar style from the 12th to 17th centuries was developed by introducing arab style motifs patterns and elements into european architecture the arrival of modernism in the academic arena produced much of the architecture of the 20th century an influential style centred in barcelona known as modernisme produced a number of important architects of which gaudí is one the international style was led by groups like gatepac spain is currently experiencing a revolution in contemporary architecture and spanish architects like rafael

traditional bag pipers or gaiteros mainly in asturias and galicia cuisine spanish cuisine consists of a great variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography culture and climate it is
