numerous disputes between great britain and the colonies in the aftermath of the seven years war led to the american revolution which began in 1775 on july 4 1776 as the colonies were fighting great britain in the american revolutionary war delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the declaration of independence the war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the united states by great britain and was the first successful war of independence against a european colonial empire 27 the current constitution was adopted in 1788 after the articles of confederation adopted

cartographer amerigo vespucci latin americus vespucius 41 the first documentary evidence of the phrase united states of america is from a letter dated january 2 1776 written by stephen moylan esq george washingtons aide-de-camp and muster-master general of the continental army addressed to lt col joseph reed moylan expressed his wish to carry the full and ample powers of the united states of america to spain to assist in the revolutionary war effort 42 43 44 the first known publication of the phrase united states of america was in an anonymous essay in the virginia gazette newspaper in williamsburg virginia on april 6 1776 45 46 the second draft of the articles of confederation prepared by john dickinson and completed by june 17 1776 at the latest declared the name of this confederation shall be the united states of america 47 the final version of the articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the sentence the stile of this confederacy shall be the united states of america 48 in june 1776 thomas jefferson wrote the phrase united states of america in all capitalized letters in the headline of his original rough draught of the declaration of independence 49 50 this draft of the document did not surface until june 21 1776 and it is unclear whether it was written before or after dickinson used the term in his june 17 draft of the articles of confederation 47 in the final fourth of july version of the declaration the title was changed to read the unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of america 51 the preamble of the constitution states establish this constitution for the united states of america the short form united states is also standard other common forms are the us the usa and america colloquial names are the us of a and internationally the states columbia a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century derives its origin from christopher columbus it appears in the name district of columbia 52 in non-english languages the name is frequently the translation of either the united states or united states of america and colloquially as america in addition an abbreviation eg usa is sometimes used 53 the phrase united states was originally plural a description of a collection of independent stateseg the united states areincluding in the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution ratified in 1865 the singular formeg the united states is became popular after the end of the american civil war the singular form is now standard the plural form is retained in the idiom these united states 54 the difference is more significant than usage it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit 55 a citizen of the united states is an american united states american and us refer to the country adjectivally american values usforces american rarely refers to subjects not connected with the united states 56 history indigenous and european contact the first inhabitants of north america migrated from siberia by way of the bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival 26 some such as the pre-columbian mississippian culture developed advanced agriculture grand architecture and state-level societies 57 after the spanish conquistadors made the first contacts the native population declined for various reasons primarily from diseases such as smallpox and measles violence was not a significant factor in the overall decline among native americans though conflict among themselves and with europeans affected specific tribes and various colonial settlements 58 59 60 61 62 63 in the hawaiian islands the earliest indigenous inhabitants arrived around 1 ad from polynesia europeans under the british explorer captain james cook arrived in the hawaiian islands in 1778 in the early days of colonization many european settlers were subject to food shortages disease and attacks from native americans native americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with europeans in their colonial wars at the same time however many natives and settlers came to depend on each other settlers traded for food and animal pelts natives for guns ammunition and other european wares 64 natives taught many settlers where when and how to cultivate corn beans and squash european missionaries and others felt it was important to civilize the native americans and urged them to adopt european agricultural techniques and lifestyles 65 66 settlements after spain sent columbus on his first voyage to the new world in 1492 other explorers followed the spanish set up small settlements in new mexico and florida france had several small settlements along the mississippi river successful english settlement on the eastern coast of north america began with the virginia colony in 1607 at jamestown and the pilgrims plymouth colony in 1620 early experiments in communal living failed until the introduction of private farm holdings 67 many settlers were dissenting christian groups who came seeking religious freedom the continents first elected legislative assembly virginias house of burgesses created in 1619 and the mayflower compact signed by the pilgrims before disembarking established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the american colonies 68 69 most settlers in every colony were small farmers but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements cash crops included tobacco rice and wheat extraction industries grew up in furs fishing and lumber manufacturers produced rum and ships and by the late colonial period americans were producing one-seventh of the worlds iron supply 70 cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs english colonists were supplemented by waves of scotch-irish and other groups as coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servants pushed further west 71 slave cultivation of cash crops began with the spanish in the 1500s and was adopted by the english but life expectancy was much higher in north america because of less disease and better food and treatment leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves 72 73 74 colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice 75 76 but by the turn of the 18th century african slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor especially in southern regions 77 with the british colonization of georgia in 1732 the 13 colonies that would become the united states of america were established 78 all had local governments with elections open to most free men with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism 79 with extremely high birth rates low death rates and steady settlement the colonial population grew rapidly relatively small native american populations were eclipsed 80 the christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the great awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty 81 during the seven years war also known as the french and indian war british forces seized canada from the french but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies excluding the native americans who were being conquered and displaced those 13 colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770 about one-third that of britain despite continuing new arrivals the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of americans had been born overseas 82 the colonies distance from britain had allowed the development of self-government but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority 83 independence and expansion  1776–1865 the american revolutionary war was the first successful colonial war of independence against a european power americans had developed an ideology of republicanism asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures they demanded their rights as englishmen and no taxation without representation the british insisted on administering the empire through parliament and the conflict escalated into war 84 following the passage of the lee resolution on july 2 1776 which was the actual vote for independence the second continental congress adopted the declaration of independence on july 4 which proclaimed in a long preamble that humanity is created equal in their unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by great britain and declared in the words of the resolution that the thirteen colonies were independent states and had no allegiance to the british crown in the united states the fourth day of july is celebrated annually as independence day in 1777 the articles of confederation established a weak government that operated until 1789 85 britain recognized the independence of the united states following their defeat at yorktown 86 in the peace treaty of 1783 american sovereignty was recognized from the atlantic coast west to the mississippi river nationalists led the philadelphia convention of 1787 in writing the united states constitution ratified in state conventions in 1788 the federal government was reorganized into three branches on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances in 1789 george washington who had led the revolutionary army to victory was the first president elected under the new constitution the bill of rights forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections was adopted in 1791 87 although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808 after 1820 cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the deep south and along with it the slave population 88 89 90 the second great awakening especially 1800-1840 converted millions to evangelical protestantism in the north it energized multiple social reform movements including abolitionism 91 in the south methodists and baptists proselytized among slave populations 92 americans eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of american indian wars 93 the louisiana purchase of french-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nations area 94 the war of 1812 declared against britain over various grievances and fought to a draw strengthened us nationalism 95 a series of military incursions into florida led spain to cede it and other gulf coast territory in 1819 96 expansion was aided by steam power when steamboats began traveling along americas large water systems which were connected by new canals such as the erie and the im then even faster railroads began their stretch across the nations land 97 from 1820 to 1850 jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider white male suffrage it led to the rise of the second party system of democrats and whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854 the trail of tears in the 1830s exemplified the indian removal policy that resettled indians into the west on indian reservations the us annexed the republic of texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist manifest destiny 98 the 1846 oregon treaty with britain led to us control of the present-day american northwest 99 victory in the mexicanamerican war resulted in the 1848 mexican cession of california and much of the present-day american southwest 100 the california gold rush of 1848–49 spurred western migration and the creation of additional western states 101 after the american civil war new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with native americans 102 over a half-century the loss of the american bison sometimes called buffalo was an existential blow to many plains indians cultures 103 in 1869 a new peace policy sought to protect native-americans from abuses avoid further war and secure their eventual us citizenship although conflicts including several of the largest indian wars continued throughout the west into the 1900s 104 civil war and reconstruction era differences of opinion and social order between northern and southern states in early united states society particularly regarding black slavery ultimately led to the american civil war 105 initially states entering the union alternated between slave and free states keeping a sectional balance in the senate while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the house of representatives but with additional western territory and more free-soil states tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories whether and how to expand or restrict slavery 106 with the 1860 election of abraham lincoln the first president from the largely anti-slavery republican party conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the confederate states of america while the federal government maintained that secession was illegal 106 the ensuing war was at first for union then after 1863 as casualties mounted and lincoln delivered his emancipation proclamation a second war aim became abolition of slavery the war remains the deadliest military conflict in american history resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians 107 following the union victory in 1865 three amendments were added to the us constitution the thirteenth amendment prohibited slavery the fourteenth amendment provided citizenship to the nearly four million african americans who had been slaves 108 and the fifteenth amendment ensured that they had the right to vote the war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power 109 aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves southern white conservatives calling themselves redeemers took control after the end of reconstruction by the 1890-1910 period jim crow laws disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites especially in the south and the west blacks indians chinese and hispanics faced systemic discrimination including racial segregationnot in citation given and occasional vigilante violence 110 111 industrialization in the north urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from southern and eastern europe supplied a surplus of labor for the countrys industrialization and transformed its culture 112 national infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the american old west the later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life 113 the end of the indian wars further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation increasing surpluses for international markets 114 mainland expansion was completed by the purchase of alaska from russia in 1867 115 in 1893 pro-american elements in hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the republic of hawaii which the us annexed in 1898 puerto rico guam and the philippines were ceded by spain in the same year following the spanishamerican war 116 rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists tycoons like cornelius vanderbilt john d rockefeller and andrew carnegie led the nations progess in railroad petroleum and steel industries banking became a major part of the economy with jp morgan playing a notable role edison and tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry homes and for street lightiing henry ford revolutionized the automotive industry the american economy boomed becoming the worlds largest and the united states achieved great power status 117 these dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist socialist and anarchist movements 118 this period eventually ended with the advent of the progressive era which saw significant reforms in many societal areas including womens suffrage alcohol prohibition regulation of consumer goods greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions world war i great depression and world war ii the united states remained neutral from the outbreak of world war i in 1914 until 1917 when it joined the war as an associated power alongside the formal allies of world war i helping to turn the tide against the central powers in 1919 president woodrow wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the paris peace conference and advocated strongly for the us to join the league of nations however the senate refused to approve this and did not ratify the treaty of versailles that established the league of nations 119 in 1920 the womens rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting womens suffrage 120 the 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television 121 the prosperity of the roaring twenties ended with the wall street crash of 1929 and the onset of the great depression after his election as president in 1932 franklin d roosevelt responded with the new deal which included the establishment of the social security system 122 the great migration of millions of african americans out of the american south began before world war i and extended through the 1960s 123 whereas the dust bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration 124 at first effectively neutral during world war ii while germany conquered much of continental europe the united states began supplying material to the allies in march 1941 through the lend-lease program on december 7 1941 the empire of japan launched a surprise attack on pearl harbor prompting the united states to join the allies against the axis powers 125 during the war the united states was referred as one of the four policemen 126 of allies power who met to plan the postwar world along with britain the soviet union and china 127 128 though the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers 129 it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence 130 the united states played a leading role in the bretton woods and yalta conferences with the united kingdom the soviet union and other allies which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and europes postwar reorganization as an allied victory was won in europe a 1945 international conference held in san francisco produced the united nations charter which became active after the war 131 the united states developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on japan the japanese surrendered on september 2 ending world war ii 132 cold war and civil rights era after world war ii the united states and the soviet union jockeyed for power during what became known as the cold war driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism 133 and according to the school of geopolitics a divide between the maritime atlantic and the continental eurasian camps they dominated the military affairs of europe with the us and its nato allies on one side and the ussr and its warsaw pact allies on the other the us developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence while the us and soviet union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals the two countries avoided direct military conflict the us often opposed third world movements that it viewed as soviet-sponsored american troops fought communist chinese and north korean forces in the korean war of 1950–53 134 the soviet unions 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned spaceflight initiated a space race in which the united states became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969 134 a proxy war in southeast asia eventually evolved into full american participation as the vietnam war at home the us experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class construction of an interstate highway system transformed the nations infrastructure over the following decades millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments 135 136 in 1959 hawaii became the 50th and last us state added to the country 137 a growing civil rights movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination with martin luther king jr becoming a prominent leader and figurehead a combination of court decisions and legislation culminating in the civil rights act of 1968 sought to end racial discrimination 138 139 140 meanwhile a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the vietnam war black nationalism and the sexual revolution the launch of a war on poverty expanded entitlements and welfare spending 141 the 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation after his election in 1980 president ronald reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms following the collapse of détente he abandoned containment and initiated the more aggressive rollback strategy towards the ussr 142 143 144 145 146 after a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed 147 the late 1980s brought a thaw in relations with the ussr and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the cold war 148 149 150 151 this brought about unipolarity 152 with the us unchallenged as the worlds dominant superpower the concept of pax americana which had appeared in the post-world war ii period gained wide popularity as a term for the post-cold war new world order contemporary history after the cold war the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern us history ending in 2001 153 originating in us defense networks the internet spread to international academic networks and then to the public in the 1990s greatly affecting the global economy society and culture 154 on september 11 2001 al-qaeda terrorists struck the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon near washington dc killing nearly 3,000 people 155 in

states spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance the most in the world as a share of americas large gross national income gni however the us contribution of 0.18 ranked last among 22 donor states by contrast private overseas giving by americans is relatively generous 315 the us exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for three sovereign nations through compact of free association with micronesia the marshall islands and palau these are pacific island nations once part of the us-administered trust territory of the pacific islands after world war ii

$118,500 for 2015 and 2016 and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains 329 330 the historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers 331 332 however according to the congressional budget office the net effect of social security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70 for the top earnings quintile to about 170 for the lowest earning quintile making the system progressive 333 the top 10 paid 51.8 of total federal taxes in 2009 and the top 1 with 13.4

quintile and −2.7 for the bottom quintile 335 336 the incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades 325 337 state and local taxes vary widely but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation 325 338 during fy 2012 the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis down $60 billion or 1.7 vs fy 2011 spending of $3.60

in the united states for certain federal and military crimes and used in 31 states 367 368 no executions took place from 1967 to 1977 owing in part to a us supreme court ruling striking down arbitrary
