induction generator an induction generator or asynchronous generator is a type of alternating current ac electrical generator that uses the principles of induction motors to produce power induction generators operate by mechanically turning their rotors faster than synchronous speed a regular ac asynchronous motor usually can be used as a generator without any internal modifications induction generators are useful in applications such as mini hydro power plants wind turbines or in reducing high-pressure gas streams to lower pressure because they can recover energy with relatively simple controls an induction generator usually draws its excitation power from an electrical grid sometimes however they are self-excited by using phase-correcting capacitors because of this induction generators cannot usually black start a de-energized distribution system  contents 1 principle of operation 1.1 excitation 1.2 active power 1.3 required capacitance 1.4 torque vs slip 1.5 maximum

turned faster than the synchronous speed for a typical four-pole motor two pairs of poles on stator operating on a 60hz electrical grid the synchronous speed is 1800 rotations per minute rpm the same four-pole motor operating on a 50hz grid will have a synchronous speed of 1500rpm the motor normally turns slightly slower than the synchronous speed the difference between synchronous and operating speed is called slip and is usually expressed as per cent of the synchronous speed for example a motor operating at 1450rpm that has a synchronous speed of 1500rpm is running at a slip of +3.3 in normal motor operation the stator flux rotation is faster than the rotor rotation this causes the stator flux to induce rotor currents which create a rotor flux with magnetic polarity opposite to stator in this way the rotor is dragged along behind stator flux with the currents in the rotor induced at the slip frequency in generator operation a prime mover turbine or engine drives the rotor above the synchronous speed negative slip the stator flux still induces currents in the rotor but since the opposing rotor flux is now cutting the stator coils an active current is produced in stator coils and the motor now operates as a generator sending power back to the electrical grid excitationedit an induction machine requires externally supplied armature current it cannot start on its own as a generator because the rotor field always lags behind the stator field the induction machine always consumes reactive power regardless of whether it is operating as a generator or a motor a source of excitation current for magnetizing flux reactive power for the stator is still required to induce rotor current this can be supplied from the electrical grid or once it starts producing power from the generator itself active poweredit active power delivered to the line is proportional to slip above the synchronous speed full rated power of the generator is reached at very small slip values motor dependent typically 3 at synchronous speed of 1800rpm generator will produce no power when the driving speed is increased to 1860rpm typical example full output power is produced if the prime mover is unable to produce enough power to fully drive the generator speed will remain somewhere between 1800 and 1860 rpm range required capacitanceedit a capacitor bank must supply reactive power to the motor when used in stand-alone mode the reactive power supplied should be equal or greater than the reactive power that the machine normally draws when operating as a motor torque vs slipedit the basic fundamental of induction generators is the conversion between mechanical energy to electrical energy this requires an external torque applied to the rotor to turn it faster than the synchronous speed however indefinitely increasing torque doesnt lead to an indefinite increase in power generation the rotating magnetic field torque excited from the armature works to counter the motion of the rotor and prevent over speed because of induced motion in the opposite direction as the speed of the motor increases the counter torque reaches a max value of torque breakdown torque that it can operate until before the operating conditions become unstable ideally induction generators work best in the stable region between the no-load condition and maximum torque region maximum pass-through currentedit in practice and without taking this notion into account many users unsuccessfully apply the principles to the actual deployment its not in popular belief that in almost every case under the same active grid voltage the power that the generator produces is greater than the power it consumes when it is at the motorfully loaded state its rated power sometimes the differences are in multiple folds higher the power means higher the amperage for prolong operation and implied in its guaranteed each motor has its maximum pass-through current this amperage value the current density is derived from the maximum pass-through current property of the internal copper magnet wire and the combined configuration of their connections without opening up the unit to examine the internal setting of the copper wires a division of the wattage of its rated power by its rated voltage can give users some senses of how much that value is therefore claims of making a unit generates more power than its rated should get a closer examination grid and stand-alone connectionsedit in induction generators the reactive power required to establish the air gap magnetic flux is provided by a capacitor bank connected to the machine in case of stand-alone system and in case of grid connection it draws reactive power from the grid to maintain its air gap flux for a grid-connected system frequency and voltage at the machine will be dictated by the electric grid since it is very small compared to the whole system for stand-alone systems frequency and voltage are complex function of machine parameters capacitance used for excitation and load value and type limitations of induction generators 1edit an induction generator cannot generate reactive power actually it requires reactive power from supply line to furnish its excitation since it has no means for establishing air gap flux with stator open circuited operation of an induction generator requires a synchronous machine whether generator or motor on the line to supply the induction generator with its needed excitation power this requirement limits the use of induction generators to specialty applications use of induction generatorsedit induction generators are often used in wind turbines and some micro hydro installations due to their ability to produce useful power at varying rotor speeds induction generators are mechanically and electrically simpler than other generator types they are also more rugged requiring no brushes or commutators induction generators are particularly suitable for wind generating stations as in this case speed is always a variable factor unlike synchronous motors induction generators are load-dependent and cannot be used alone for grid frequency control example applicationedit as an example consider the use of a 10hp 1760rmin 440v three-phase induction motor as an asynchronous generator the full-load current of the motor is 10a and the full-load power factor is 0.8 required capacitance per phase if capacitors are connected in delta for a machine to run as an asynchronous generator capacitor bank must supply minimum 4567  3 phases  1523 var per phase voltage per capacitor is 440v because capacitors are connected in delta minimum capacitance per phase if the load also absorbs reactive power capacitor bank must be increased in size to compensate prime mover speed should be used to generate frequency of 60hz typically slip should be similar to full-load value when machine is running as motor but negative generator operation see alsoedit
