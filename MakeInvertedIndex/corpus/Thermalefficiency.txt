fuel heating value  overviewedit in general energy conversion efficiency is the ratio between the useful output of a device and the input in energy terms for thermal efficiency the input q i n displaystyle qin  to the device is heat or the heat-content of a fuel that is consumed the desired output is mechanical work w o u t displaystyle wout  or heat q o u t displaystyle qout  or possibly both because the input heat normally has a real financial cost a memorable generic definition of thermal efficiency is 1 from the first law of thermodynamics the energy output cannot exceed the input so when expressed as a percentage the thermal efficiency must be between 0 and 100 efficiency is typically less than 100 because there are inefficiencies such as friction and heat loss that convert the energy into alternative forms for example a typical gasoline automobile engine operates at around 25 efficiency and a large coal-fueled electrical generating plant peaks at about 46 advances in formula 1 motorsport regulations have pushed teams to develop highly efficient power units which peak around 45-50 thermal efficiency the largest diesel engine in the world peaks at 51.7 in a combined cycle plant thermal efficiencies are approaching 60 2 such a real-world value may be used as a figure of merit for the device for engines where a fuel is burned there are two types of thermal efficiency indicated thermal efficiency and brake thermal efficiency 3 this efficiency is only appropriate when comparing similar types or similar devices for other systems the specifics of the calculations of efficiency vary but the non dimensional input is still the same efficiency  output energy  input energy heat enginesedit heat engines transform thermal energy or heat qin into mechanical energy or work wout they cannot do this task perfectly so some of the input heat energy is not converted into work but is dissipated as waste heat qout into the environment the thermal efficiency of a heat engine is the percentage of heat energy that is transformed into work thermal efficiency is defined as the efficiency of even the best heat engines is low usually below 50 and often far below so the energy lost to the environment by heat engines is a major waste of energy resources since a large fraction of the fuels produced worldwide go to powering heat engines perhaps up to half of the useful energy produced worldwide is wasted in engine inefficiency although modern cogeneration combined cycle and energy recycling schemes are beginning to use this heat for other purposes this inefficiency can be attributed to three causes there is an overall theoretical limit to the efficiency of any heat engine due to temperature called the carnot efficiency second specific types of engines have lower limits on their efficiency due to the inherent irreversibility of the engine cycle they use thirdly the nonideal behavior of real engines such as mechanical friction and losses in the combustion process causes further efficiency losses carnot efficiencyedit the second law of thermodynamics puts a fundamental limit on the thermal efficiency of all heat engines even an ideal frictionless engine cant convert anywhere near 100 of its input heat into work the limiting factors are the temperature at which the heat enters the engine t h displaystyle th  and the temperature of the environment into which the engine exhausts its waste heat t c displaystyle tc  measured in an absolute scale such as the kelvin or rankine scale from carnots theorem for any engine working between these two temperatures 4 this limiting value is called the carnot cycle efficiency because it is the efficiency of an unattainable ideal reversible engine cycle called the carnot cycle no device converting heat into mechanical energy regardless of its construction can exceed this efficiency examples of t h displaystyle th are the temperature of hot steam entering the turbine of a steam power plant or the temperature at which the fuel burns in an internal combustion engine t c displaystyle tc is usually the ambient temperature where the engine is located or the temperature of a lake or river that waste heat is discharged into for example if an automobile engine burns gasoline at a temperature of t h  816  c  1500  f  1089 k displaystyle th=816circ textc=1500circ textf=1089textk and the ambient temperature is t c  21  c  70  f  294 k displaystyle tc=21circ textc=70circ textf=294textk  then its maximum possible efficiency is it can be seen that since t c displaystyle tc is fixed by the environment the only way for a designer to increase the carnot efficiency of an engine is to increase t h displaystyle th  the temperature at which the heat is added to the engine the efficiency of ordinary heat engines also generally increases with operating temperature and advanced structural materials that allow engines to operate at higher temperatures is an active area of research due to the other causes detailed below practical engines have efficiencies far below the carnot limit for example the average automobile engine is less than 35 efficient carnots theorem applies to thermodynamic cycles where thermal energy is converted to mechanical work devices that convert a fuels chemical energy directly into electrical work such as fuel cells can exceed the carnot efficiency  5 6 engine cycle efficiencyedit the carnot cycle is reversible and thus represents the upper limit on efficiency of an engine cycle practical engine cycles are irreversible and thus have inherently lower efficiency than the carnot efficiency when operated between the same temperatures t h displaystyle th and t c displaystyle tc  one of the factors determining efficiency is how heat is added to the working fluid in the cycle and how it is removed the carnot cycle achieves maximum efficiency because all the heat is added to the working fluid at the maximum temperature t h displaystyle th  and removed at the minimum temperature t c displaystyle tc  in contrast in an internal combustion engine the temperature of the fuel-air mixture in the cylinder is nowhere near its peak temperature as the fuel starts to burn and only reaches the peak temperature as all the fuel is consumed so the average temperature at which heat is added is lower reducing efficiency an important parameter in the efficiency of combustion engines is the specific heat ratio of the air-fuel mixture γ this varies somewhat with the fuel but is generally close to the air value of 1.4 this standard value is usually used in the engine cycle equations below and when this approximation is made the cycle is called an air-standard cycle otto cycle automobiles the otto cycle is the name for the cycle used in spark-ignition internal combustion engines such as gasoline and hydrogen fueled automobile engines its theoretical efficiency depends on the compression ratio r of the engine and the specific heat ratio γ of the gas in the combustion chamber 4:558 diesel cycle trucks and trains in the diesel cycle used in diesel truck and train engines the fuel is ignited by compression in the cylinder the efficiency of the diesel cycle is dependent on r and γ like the otto cycle and also by the cutoff ratio rc which is the ratio of the cylinder volume at the beginning and end of the combustion process 4 rankine cycle steam power plants the rankine cycle is the cycle used in steam turbine power plants the overwhelming majority of the worlds electric power is produced with this cycle since the cycles working fluid water changes from liquid to vapor and back during the cycle their efficiencies depend on the thermodynamic properties of water the thermal efficiency of modern steam turbine plants with reheat cycles can reach 47 and in combined cycle plants in which a steam turbine is powered by exhaust heat from a gas turbine it can approach 60 4 brayton cycle gas turbines and jet engines the brayton cycle is the cycle used in gas turbines and jet engines it consists of a compressor that increases pressure of the incoming air then fuel is continuously added to the flow and burned and the hot exhaust gasses are expanded in a turbine the efficiency depends largely on the ratio of the pressure inside the combustion chamber p2 to the pressure outside p1 4 other inefficienciesedit the above efficiency formulas are based on simple idealized mathematical models of engines with no friction and working fluids that obey simple thermodynamic rules called the ideal gas law real engines have many departures from ideal behavior that waste energy reducing actual efficiencies far below the theoretical values given above examples are friction of moving parts inefficient combustion heat loss from the combustion chamber departure of the working fluid from the thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas aerodynamic drag of air moving through the engine energy used by auxiliary equipment like oil and water pumps inefficient compressors and turbines imperfect valve timing another source of inefficiency is that engines must be optimized for other goals besides efficiency such as low pollution the requirements for vehicle engines are particularly stringent they must be designed for low emissions adequate acceleration fast starting light weight low noise etc these require compromises in design such as altered valve timing to reduce emissions that reduce efficiency the average automobile engine is only about 35 efficient and must also be kept idling at stoplights wasting an additional 17 of the energy resulting in an overall efficiency of 18 7 large stationary electric generating plants have fewer of these competing requirements as well as more efficient rankine cycles so they are significantly more efficient than vehicle engines around 50 therefore replacing internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles which run on a battery that is charged with electricity generated by burning fuel in a power plant has the theoretical potential to increase the thermal efficiency of energy use in transportation thus decreasing the demand for fossil fuels when comparing different heat engines as sources of power such as electric power or the power to run vehicles the engine efficiency alone is only one factor to give a meaningful comparison the overall efficiency of the entire energy supply chain from the fuel source to the consumer must be considered although the heat wasted by heat engines is usually the largest source of inefficiency factors such as the energy cost of fuel refining and transportation and energy loss in electrical transmission lines to transport it may offset the advantage of a more efficient heat engine energy conversionedit for a device that converts energy from another form into thermal energy such as an electric heater boiler or furnace the thermal efficiency is where the q displaystyle q quantities are heat-equivalent values so for a boiler that produces 210kw or 700,000 btuh output for each 300kw or 1,000,000 btuh heat-equivalent input its thermal efficiency is 210/300  0.70 or 70 this means that 30 of the energy is lost to the environment an electric resistance heater has a thermal efficiency close to 100 8 when comparing heating units such as a highly efficient electric resistance heater to an 80 efficient natural gas-fueled furnace an economic analysis is needed to determine the most cost-effective choice effects of fuel heating valueedit the heating value of a fuel is the amount of heat released during an exothermic reaction eg combustion and is a characteristic of each substance it is measured in units of energy per unit of the substance usually mass such as kjkg jmol the heating value for fuels is expressed as the hhv lhv or ghv to distinguish treatment of the heat of phase changes higher heating value hhv is determined by bringing all the products of combustion back to the original pre-combustion temperature and in particular condensing any vapor produced this is the same as the thermodynamic heat of combustion lower heating value lhv or net calorific value is determined by subtracting the heat of vaporization of the water vapor from the higher heating value the energy required to vaporize the water therefore is not realized as heat gross heating value accounts for water in the exhaust leaving as vapor and includes liquid water in the fuel prior to combustion this value is important for fuels like wood or coal which will usually contain some amount of water prior to burning which definition of heating value is being used significantly affects any quoted efficiency not stating whether an efficiency is hhv or lhv renders such numbers very misleading heat pumps and refrigeratorsedit heat pumps refrigerators and air conditioners use work to move heat from a colder to a warmer place so their function is the opposite of a heat engine the work energy win that is applied to them is converted into heat and the sum of this energy and the heat energy that is moved from the cold reservoir qc is equal to the total heat energy added to the hot reservoir qh their efficiency is measured by a coefficient of performance cop heat pumps are measured by the efficiency with which they add heat to the hot reservoir copheating refrigerators and air conditioners by the efficiency with which they remove heat from the cold interior copcooling the reason for not using the term efficiency is that the coefficient of performance can often be greater than 100 since these devices are moving heat not creating it the amount of heat they move can be greater than the input work therefore heat pumps can be a more efficient way of heating than simply converting the input work into heat as in an electric heater or furnace since they are heat engines these devices are also limited by carnots theorem the limiting value of the carnot efficiency for these processes with the equality theoretically achievable only with an ideal reversible cycle is the same device used between the same temperatures is more efficient when considered as a heat pump than when considered as a refrigerator this is because when heating the work used to run the device is converted to heat and adds to the desired effect whereas if the desired effect is cooling the heat resulting from the input work is just an unwanted byproduct energy efficiencyedit the thermal efficiency is sometimes called the energy efficiency in the united states in everyday usage the seer is the more common measure of energy efficiency for cooling devices as well as for heat pumps when in their heating mode for energy-conversion heating devices their peak steady-state thermal efficiency is often stated eg this furnace is 90 efficient but a more detailed measure of seasonal energy effectiveness is the annual fuel utilization efficiency afue 9 energy efficiency of heat exchangersedit a counter flow heat exchanger is generally 100 efficient in transferring heat energy from one circuit to the other albeit at a slight loss in temperature
