incandescent light bulb an incandescent light bulb incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light incandescence the filament heated by passing an electric current through it is protected from oxidation with a glass or quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated in a halogen lamp filament evaporation is prevented by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament extending its life the light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections incandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes light output and voltage ratings from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts they require no external regulating equipment have low manufacturing costs and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current as a result the incandescent lamp is widely used in household and commercial lighting for portable lighting such as table lamps car headlamps and flashlights and for decorative and advertising lighting incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting incandescent bulbs convert less than 5 of the energy they use into visible light 1 with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2 2 the remaining energy is converted into heat the luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt compared with 60lmw for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150lmw for some white led lamps 3 some applications of the incandescent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the filament such applications include incubators brooding boxes for poultry 4 heat lights for reptile tanks 5 infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes lava lamps and the easy-bake oven toy incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared with other types of lighting around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting leds incandescent bulbs have been replaced in many applications by other types of electric light such as fluorescent lamps compact fluorescent lamps cfl cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfl high-intensity discharge lamps and light-emitting diode lamps led some jurisdictions such as the european union china canada and united states are in the process of phasing out the use of incandescent light bulbs while others including colombia 6 mexico cuba

lamp historians robert friedel and paul israel 8 list 22 inventors of incandescent lamps prior to joseph swan and thomas edison they conclude that edisons version was able to outstrip the others because of a combination of three factors an effective incandescent material a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve by use of the sprengel pump and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable historian thomas hughes has attributed edisons success to his development of an entire integrated system of electric lighting the lamp was a small component in his system of electric lighting and no more critical to its effective functioning than the edison jumbo generator the edison main and feeder and the parallel-distribution system other inventors with generators and incandescent lamps and with comparable ingenuity and excellence have long been forgotten because their creators did not preside over their introduction in a system of lighting early pre-commercial research in 1747 an italian monk by the name of giuseppe ponzelli was the first to theorise an incandescent light 12 in 1761 ebenezer kinnersley demonstrated heating a wire to incandescence 13 in 1802 humphry davy used what he described as a battery of immense size 14 consisting of 2,000 cells housed in the basement of the royal institution of great britain 15 to create an incandescent light by passing the current through a thin strip of platinum chosen because the metal had an extremely high melting point it was not bright enough nor did it last long enough to be practical but it was the precedent behind the efforts of scores of experimenters over the next 75 years 16 over the first three-quarters of the 19th century many experimenters worked with various combinations of platinum or iridium wires carbon rods and evacuated or semi-evacuated enclosures many of these devices were demonstrated and some were patented 17 in 1835 james bowman lindsay demonstrated a constant electric light at a public meeting in dundee scotland he stated that he could read a book at a distance of one and a half feet however having perfected the device to his own satisfaction he turned to the problem of wireless telegraphy and did not develop the electric light any further his claims are not well documented although he is credited in challoner et al with being the inventor of the incandescent light bulb 18 in 1838 a belgian by the name of jobard invented an incandescent light bulb with a vacuum atmosphere using a carbon filament 19 in 1840 british scientist warren de la rue enclosed a coiled platinum filament in a vacuum tube and passed an electric current through it the design was based on the concept that the high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react with the platinum improving its longevity although a workable design the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial use in 1841 frederick de moleyns of england was granted the first patent for an incandescent lamp with a design using platinum wires contained within a vacuum bulb he also used carbon 20 21 in 1845 american john w starr acquired a patent for his incandescent light bulb involving the use of carbon filaments 22 23 he died shortly after obtaining the patent and his invention was never produced commercially little else is known about him 24 in 1851 jean eugène robert-houdin publicly demonstrated incandescent light bulbs on his estate in blois france his light bulbs are on display in the museum of the château de blois 25 in 1872 russian alexander lodygin invented an incandescent light bulb and obtained a russian patent in 1874 he used as a burner two carbon rods of diminished section in a glass receiver hermetically sealed and filled with nitrogen electrically arranged so that the current could be passed to the second carbon when the first had been consumed 26 later he lived in the us changed his name to alexander de lodyguine and applied and obtained patents for incandescent lamps having chromium iridium rhodium ruthenium osmium molybdenum and tungsten filaments 27 and a bulb using a molybdenum filament was demonstrated at the world fair of 1900 in paris 28 heinrich göbel in 1893 claimed he had designed the first incandescent light bulb in 1854 with a thin carbonized bamboo filament of high resistance platinum lead-in wires in an all-glass envelope and a high vacuum judges of four courts raised doubts about the alleged göbel anticipation but there was never a decision in a final hearing due to the expiry date of edisons patent a research work published 2007 concluded that the story of the göbel lamps in the 1850s is a legend 29 on 24 july 1874 a canadian patent was filed by henry woodward and mathew evans for a lamp consisting of carbon rods mounted in a nitrogen-filled glass cylinder they were unsuccessful at commercializing their lamp and sold rights to their patent us patent 0,181,613 to thomas edison in 1879 30 31 commercialization dominance of carbon filament and vacuum joseph swan  1828–1914 was a british physicist and chemist in 1850 he began working with carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb by 1860 he was able to demonstrate a working device but the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a short lifetime for the bulb and an inefficient source of light by the mid-1870s better pumps became available and swan returned to his experiments with the help of charles stearn an expert on vacuum pumps in 1878 swan developed a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening this received a british patent in 1880 32dubious  discuss on 18 december 1878 a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown at a meeting of the newcastle chemical society and swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 january 1879 it was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the literary and philosophical society of newcastle upon tyne on 3 february 1879 33 these lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current so they were not commercially practical although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum a carbon conductor and platinum lead-in wires this bulb lasted about 40 hours 34 swan then turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends he devised a method of treating cotton to produce parchmentised thread in the early 1880s and obtained british patent 4933 that same year 32 from this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in england his house was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power in 1878 the home of lord armstrong at cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity in the early 1880s he had started his company 35 in 1881 the savoy theatre in the city of westminster london was lit by swan incandescent lightbulbs which was the first theatre and the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity 36 thomas edison began serious research into developing a practical incandescent lamp in 1878 edison filed his first patent application for improvement in electric lights on 14 october 1878 37 after many experiments first with carbon in the early 1880s and then with platinum and other metals in the end edison returned to a carbon filament 38 the first successful test was on 22 october 1879 39 40 and lasted 13.5 hours edison continued to improve this design and by 4 november 1879 filed for a us patent for an electric lamp using a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected  to platina contact wires 41 although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including using cotton and linen thread wood splints papers coiled in various ways 41 edison and his team later discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last more than 1200 hours 42 in 1880 the oregon railroad and navigation company steamer columbia became the first application for edisons incandescent electric lamps it was also the first ship to execute use of a dynamo 43 44 45 albon man a new york lawyer started electro-dynamic light company in 1878 to exploit his patents and those of william sawyer 46 47 weeks later the united states electric lighting company was organized 46 47 48 this company didnt make their first commercial installation of incandescent lamps until the fall of 1880 at the mercantile safe deposit company in new york city about six months after the edison incandescent lamps had been installed on the columbia hiram s maxim was the chief engineer at the united states electric lighting company 49 lewis latimer employed at the time by edison developed an improved method of heat-treating carbon filaments which reduced breakage and allowed them to be molded into novel shapes such as the characteristic m shape of maxim filaments on 17 january 1882 latimer received a patent for the process of manufacturing carbons an improved method for the production of light bulb filaments which was purchased by the united states electric light company 50 latimer patented other improvements such as a better way of attaching filaments to their wire supports 51 in britain the edison and swan companies merged into the edison and swan united electric company later known as ediswan and ultimately incorporated into thorn lighting ltd edison was initially against this combination but after swan sued him and won edison was eventually forced to cooperate and the merger was made eventually edison acquired all of swans interest in the company swan sold his us patent rights to the brush electric company in june 1882 the united states patent office gave a ruling 8 october 1883 that edisons patents were based on the prior art of william sawyer and were invalid litigation continued for a number of years eventually on 6 october 1889 a judge ruled that edisons electric light improvement claim for a filament of carbon of high resistance was valid 52 in 1897 german physicist and chemist walther nernst developed the nernst lamp a form of incandescent lamp that used a ceramic globar and did not require enclosure in a vacuum or inert gas 53 54 twice as efficient as carbon filament lamps nernst lamps were briefly popular until overtaken by lamps using metal filaments revolution of tungsten filament and inert gas on 13 december 1904 hungarian sándor just and croatian franjo hanaman were granted a hungarian patent no 34541 for a tungsten filament lamp that lasted longer and gave brighter light than the carbon filament tungsten filament lamps were first marketed by the hungarian company tungsram in 1904 this type is often called tungsram-bulbs in many european countries 55 filling a bulb with an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen retards the evaporation of the tungsten filament compared to operating it in a vacuum this allows for greater temperatures and therefore greater efficacy with less reduction in filament life 56 in 1906 the general electric company patented a method of making filaments from sintered tungsten and in 1911 used ductile tungsten wire for incandescent light bulbs in 1913 irving langmuir found that filling a lamp with inert gas instead of a vacuum resulted in twice the luminous efficacy and reduction of bulb blackening in 1924 marvin pipkin an american chemist patented a process for frosting the inside of lamp bulbs without weakening them and in 1947 he patented a process for coating the inside of lamps with silica between 1924 and the outbreak of the second world war the phoebus cartel attempted to fix prices and sales quotas for bulb manufacturers outside of north america in 1930 hungarian imre bródy filled lamps with krypton gas rather than argon and designed a process to obtain krypton from air production of krypton filled lamps based on his invention started at ajka in 1937 in a factory co-designed by polányi and hungarian-born physicist egon orowan 57 by 1964 improvements in efficiency and production of incandescent lamps had reduced the cost of providing a given quantity of light by a factor of thirty compared with the cost at introduction of edisons lighting system 58 consumption of incandescent light bulbs grew rapidly in the us in 1885 an estimated 300,000 general lighting service lamps were sold all with carbon filaments when tungsten filaments were introduced about 50 million lamp sockets existed in the us in 1914 88.5 million lamps were used only 15 with carbon filaments and by 1945 annual sales of lamps were 795 million more than 5 lamps per person per year 59 efficacy efficiency and environmental impact of the power consumed by typical incandescent light bulbs 95 or more is converted into heat rather than visible light 1 other electrical light sources are more effective luminous efficacy of a light source may be defined in two ways the radiant luminous efficacy ler is the ratio of the visible light flux emitted the luminous flux to the total power radiated over all wavelengths the source luminous efficacy les is the ratio of the visible light flux emitted the luminous flux to the total power input to the source such as a lamp 60 visible light is measured in lumens a unit which is defined in part by the differing sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light not all wavelengths of visible electromagnetic energy are equally effective at stimulating the human eye the luminous efficacy of radiant energy ler is a measure of how well the distribution of energy matches the perception of the eye the units of luminous efficacy are lumens per watt lpw the maximum ler possible is 683lmw for monochromatic green light at 555 nanometers wavelength the peak sensitivity of the human eye the luminous efficiency is defined as the ratio of the luminous efficacy to the theoretical maximum luminous efficacy of 683 lpw and as for luminous efficacy is of two types radiant luminous efficiency lfr and source luminous efficacy lfscitation needed the chart below lists values of overall luminous efficacy and efficiency for several types of general service 120-volt 1000-hour lifespan incandescent bulb and several idealized light sources the values for the incandescent bulbs are source efficiencies and efficacies the values for the ideal sources are radiant efficiencies and efficacies a similar chart in the article on luminous efficacy compares a broader array of light sources to one another the spectrum emitted by a blackbody radiator at temperatures of incandescent bulbs does not match the sensitivity characteristics of the human eye the light emitted does not appear white and most is not in the range of wavelengths at which the eye is most sensitive tungsten filaments radiate mostly infrared radiation at temperatures where they remain solid  below 3,695k  3,422c 6,191f donald l klipstein explains it this way an ideal thermal radiator produces visible light most efficiently at temperatures around 6,300c  6,600k 11,400f even at this high temperature a lot of the radiation is either infrared or ultraviolet and the theoretical luminous efficacy ler is 95 lumens per watt 61 no known material can be used as a filament at this ideal temperature which is hotter than the suns surface an upper limit for incandescent lamp luminous efficacy ler is around 52 lumens per watt the theoretical value emitted by tungsten at its melting point 58 although inefficient incandescent light bulbs have an advantage in applications where accurate color reproduction is important since the continuous blackbody spectrum emitted from an incandescent light-bulb filament yields near-perfect color rendition with a color rendering index of 100 the best possible 63 white-balancing is still required to avoid too warm or cool colors but this is a simple process that requires only the color temperature in kelvin as input for modern digital visual reproduction equipment such as video or still cameras unless it is completely automated the color-rendering performance of incandescent lights cannot be matched by leds or fluorescent lights although they can offer satisfactory performance for non-critical applications such as home lighting 64 65 white-balancing such lights is therefore more complicated requiring additional adjustments to reduce for example green-magenta color casts and even when properly white-balanced the color reproduction will not be perfect for a given quantity of light an incandescent light bulb produces more heat and thus consumes more power than a fluorescent lamp in buildings where air conditioning is used incandescent lamps heat output increases load on the air conditioning system 66 while heat from lights will reduce the need for running a buildings heating system in general a heating system can provide the same amount of heat at a lower cost than incandescent lights halogen incandescent lamps have higher efficacy which will allow a halogen light to use less power to produce the same amount of light compared to a non-halogen incandescent light the expected life span of halogen lights is also generally longer compared to non-halogen incandescent lights and halogen lights produce a more constant light-output over time without much dimming 67 there are many non-incandescent light sources such as the fluorescent lamp high-intensity discharge lamps and led lamps which have higher luminous efficiency and some have been designed to be retrofitted in fixtures for incandescent lights these devices produce light by luminescence these lamps produce discrete spectral lines and do not have the broad tail of invisible infrared emissions by careful selection of which electron energy level transitions are used and fluorescent coatings which modify the spectral distribution the spectrum emitted can be tuned to mimic the appearance of incandescent sources or other different color temperatures of white light due to the discrete spectral lines rather than a continuous spectrum the light is not ideal for applications such as photography and cinematography 64 65 cost of lighting the initial cost of an incandescent bulb is small compared to the cost of the energy it uses over its lifetime incandescent bulbs have a shorter life than most other lighting an important factor if replacement is inconvenient or expensive some types of lamp including incandescent and fluorescent emit less light as they age this may be an inconvenience or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure a comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps taking into account effective lamp lifetime cost of electricity used effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems when used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a buildings air conditioning system during the heating season heat produced by the bulbs is not wasted 68 although in most cases it is more cost effective to obtain heat from the heating system regardless over the course of a year a more efficient lighting system saves energy in nearly all climates 69 measures to ban use since incandescent light bulbs use more energy than alternatives such as cfls and led lamps many governments have introduced measures to ban their use by setting minimum efficacy standards higher than can be achieved by incandescent lamps measures to ban light bulbs have been implemented in the european union the united states russia brazil argentina canada and australia among others in the europe the ec has calculated that the ban contributes 5 to 10 billion euros to the economy and saves 40 twh of electricity every year translating in co2 emission reductions of 15 million tonnes 70 in the us federal law has scheduled the most common incandescent light bulbs to be phased out by 2014 to be replaced with more energy-efficient light bulbs 71 traditional incandescent light bulbs were phased out in australia in november 2009 72 objections to banning the use of incandescent light bulbs include the higher initial cost of alternatives and lower quality of light of fluorescent lamps 73 some people have concerns about the health effects of fluorescent lamps however even though they contain mercury the environmental performance of cfls is much better than that of light bulbs mostly because they consume much less energy and therefore strongly reduce the environmental impact of power production 74 led lamps are even more efficient and are free of mercury they are regarded as the best solution in terms of cost effectiveness and robustness 75 efforts to improve efficiency some research has been carried out to improve the efficacy of commercial incandescent lamps in 2007 the consumer lighting division of general electric announced a high efficiency incandescent hei lamp project which they claimed would ultimately be as much as four times more efficient than current incandescents although their initial production goal was to be approximately twice as efficient 76 77 the hei program was terminated in 2008 due to slow progress 78 79 us department of energy research at sandia national laboratories initially indicated the potential for dramatically improved efficiency from a photonic lattice filament 76 however later work indicated that initially promising results were in error 80 prompted by legislation in various countries mandating increased bulb efficiency new hybrid incandescent bulbs have been introduced by philips the halogena energy saver incandescents can produce about 23 lmw about 30 percent more efficient than traditional incandescents by using a reflective capsule to reflect formerly wasted infrared radiation back to the filament from which it can be re-emitted as visible light 81 this concept was pioneered by duro-test in 1980 with a commercial product that produced 29.8 lmw 82 83 more advanced reflectors based on interference filters or photonic crystals can theoretically result in higher efficiency up to a limit of about 270 lmw  40 of the maximum efficacy possible 84 laboratory proof-of-concept experiments have produced as much as 45 lmw approaching the efficacy of compact fluorescent bulbs 84 85 construction incandescent light bulbs consist of an air-tight glass enclosure the envelope or bulb with a filament of tungsten wire inside the bulb through which an electric current is passed contact wires and a base with two or more conductors provide electrical connections to the filament incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulbs base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires an electric current heats the filament to typically 2,000 to 3,300k  3,140 to 5,480f well below tungstens melting point of 3,695k  6,191f filament temperatures depend on the filament type shape size and amount of current drawn the heated filament emits light that approximates a continuous spectrum the useful part of the emitted energy is visible light but most energy is given off as heat in the near-infrared wavelengths three-way light bulbs have two filaments and three conducting contacts in their bases the filaments share a common ground and can be lit separately or together common wattages include 30–70–100 50–100–150 and 100–200–300 with the first two numbers referring to the individual filaments and the third giving the combined wattage most light bulbs have either clear or coated glass the coated glass bulbs have a white powdery substance on the inside called kaolin kaolin or kaolinite is a white chalky clay in a very fine powder form that is blown in and electrostatically deposited on the interior of the bulb it diffuses the light emitted from the filament producing a more gentle and evenly distributed light manufacturers may add pigments to the kaolin to adjust the characteristics of the final light emitted from the bulb kaolin diffused bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light other kinds of colored bulbs are also made including the various colors used for party bulbs christmas tree lights and other decorative lighting these are created by coloring the glass with a dopant which is often a metal like cobalt blue or chromium green 86 neodymium-containing glass is sometimes used to provide a more natural-appearing light many arrangements of electrical contacts are used large lamps may have a screw base one or more contacts at the tip one at the shell or a bayonet base one or more contacts on the base shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either end miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires contacts in the lamp socket allow the electric current to pass through the base to the filament power ratings for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts the glass bulb of a general service lamp can reach temperatures between 200 and 260c  392 and 500f lamps intended for high power operation or used for heating purposes will have envelopes made of hard glass or fused quartz 58 gas fill the bulb is filled with an inert gas to reduce evaporation of the filament and prevent its oxidation at a pressure of about 70kpa  0.7atm 87 the role of the gas is to prevent evaporation of the filament without introducing significant heat losses for these properties chemical inertness and high atomic or molecular weight is desirable the presence of gas molecules knocks the liberated tungsten atoms back to the filament reducing its evaporation and allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life or for operating at the same temperature prolongs the filament life it however introduces heat losses and therefore efficiency loss from the filament by heat conduction and heat convection early lamps and some small modern lamps used only a vacuum to protect the filament from oxygen this however increases evaporation of the filament albeit it eliminates the heat losses the most common fills are 88 vacuum used in small lamps provides best thermal insulation of the filament but does not protect against its evaporation used also in larger lamps where the outer bulb surface temperature has to be limited argon  93 and nitrogen  7 where argon is used for its inertness low thermal conductivity and low cost and the nitrogen is added to increase the breakdown voltage and prevent arcing between parts of the filament 87 nitrogen used in some higher-power lamps eg projection lamps and where higher breakdown voltage is needed due to proximity of filament parts or lead-in wires krypton which is more advantageous than argon due to its higher atomic weight and lower thermal conductivity which also allows use of smaller bulbs but its use is hindered by much higher cost confining it mostly to smaller-size bulbs krypton mixed with xenon where xenon improves the gas properties further due to its higher atomic weight its use is however limited by its very high cost the improvements by using xenon are modest in comparison to its cost hydrogen in special flashing lamps where rapid filament cooling is required its high thermal conductivity is exploited here the gas fill must be free of traces of water in the presence of the hot filament water reacts with tungsten forming tungsten trioxide and atomic hydrogen the oxide deposits on the bulb inner surface and reacts with hydrogen decomposing to metallic tungsten and water water then cycles back to the filament this greatly accelerates the bulb blackening in comparison with evaporation-only the gas layer close to the filament called the langmuir layer is stagnant heat transfer occurs only by conduction only at some distance does convection occur to carry heat to the bulb envelope the orientation of the filament influences efficiency gas flow parallel to the filament eg a vertically oriented bulb with vertical or axial filament reduces convective losses the efficiency of the lamp increases with a larger filament diameter thin-filament low-power bulbs benefit less from a fill gas so are often only evacuated in special cases when rapid cooling of a filament is needed eg in flashing lights hydrogen gas fill is used early lightbulbs with carbon filaments also used carbon monoxide nitrogen or mercury vapor carbon filaments however operate at lower temperatures than tungsten ones so the effect of the fill gas was not significant as the heat losses offset any benefits manufacturing early lamps were laboriously assembled by hand after automatic machinery was developed the cost of lamps fell in manufacturing the glass bulb a type of ribbon machine is used a continuous ribbon of glass is passed along a conveyor belt heated in a furnace and then blown by precisely aligned air nozzles through holes in the conveyor belt into molds thus the glass bulbs are created after the bulbs are blown and cooled they are cut off the ribbon machine a typical machine of this sort produces 50,000 bulbs per hour 89 the filament and its supports are assembled on a glass stem which is fused to the bulb the air is pumped out of the bulb and the evacuation tube in the stem press is sealed by a flame the bulb is then inserted into the lamp base and the whole assembly tested filament the first successful light bulb filaments were made of carbon from carbonized paper or bamboo early carbon filaments had a negative temperature coefficient of resistance  as they got hotter their electrical resistance decreased this made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further in the flashing process carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor usually gasoline the carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency a metallized or graphitized filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly this transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament this also changed the filament to have a positive temperature coefficient like a metallic conductor and helped stabilize the lamps power consumption temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage in 1902 the siemens company developed a tantalum lamp filament these lamps were more efficient than even graphitized carbon filaments and could operate at higher temperatures since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports the metal filament had the property of gradually shortening in use the filaments were installed with large loops that tightened in use this made lamps in use for several hundred hours quite fragile 90 metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament general electric bought the rights to use tantalum filaments and produced them in the us until 1913 91 from 1898 to around 1905 osmium was also used as a lamp filament in europe and the metal was so expensive that used broken lamps could be returned for partial credit 92 it could not be made for 110 v or 220 v so several lamps were wired in series for use on standard voltage circuits in 1906 the tungsten filament was introduced tungsten metal was initially not available in a form that allowed it to be drawn into fine wires filaments made from sintered tungsten powder were quite fragile by 1910 a process was developed by william d coolidge at general electric for production of a ductile form of tungsten the process required pressing tungsten powder into bars then several steps of sintering swaging and then wire drawing it was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use and that a very small doping treatment with potassium silicon and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments 93 coiled coil filament to improve the efficiency of the lamp the filament usually consists of multiple coils of coiled fine wire also known as a coiled coil for a 60-watt 120-volt lamp the uncoiled length of the tungsten filament is usually 22.8 inches  580mm 58 and the filament diameter is 0.0018 inches  0.046mm the advantage of the coiled coil is that evaporation of the tungsten filament is at the rate of a tungsten cylinder having a diameter equal to that of the coiled coil the coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power as a result the filament can then run hotter which results in a more efficient light source while reducing the evaporation so that the filament will last longer than a straight filament at the same temperature there are several different shapes of filament used in lamps with differing characteristics manufacturers designate the types with codes such as c-6 cc-6 c-2v cc-2v c-8 cc-88 c-2f cc-2f c-bar c-bar-6 c-8i c-2r cc-2r and axial electrical filaments are also used in hot cathodes of fluorescent lamps and vacuum tubes as a source of electrons or in vacuum tubes to heat an electron-emitting electrode reducing filament evaporation one of the problems of the standard electric light bulb is filament notching due to evaporation of the filament small variations in resistivity along the filament cause hot spots to form at points of higher resistivity 59 a variation of diameter of only 1 will cause a 25 reduction in service life 58 these hot spots evaporate faster than the rest of the filament which increases the resistance at that pointthis creates a positive feedback that ends in the familiar tiny gap in an otherwise healthy-looking filament irving langmuir found that an inert gas instead of vacuum would retard evaporation general service incandescent light bulbs over about 25 watts in rating are now filled with a mixture of mostly argon and some nitrogen 94 or sometimes krypton 95 lamps operated on direct current develop random stairstep irregularities on the filament surface which may cut lifespan in half compared to ac operation different alloys of tungsten and rhenium can be used to counteract the effect 96 97 since a filament breaking in a gas-filled bulb can form an electric arc which may spread between the terminals and draw very heavy current intentionally thin lead-in wires or more elaborate protection devices are therefore often used as fuses built into the light bulb 98 more nitrogen is used in higher-voltage lamps to reduce the possibility of arcing while inert gas reduces filament evaporation it also conducts heat from the filament thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency at constant pressure and temperature the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity because both the molecular weight is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher xenon gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight but is also more expensive so its use is limited to smaller lamps 99 during ordinary operation the tungsten of the filament evaporates hotter more-efficient filaments evaporate faster because of this the lifetime of a filament lamp is a trade-off between efficiency and longevity the trade-off is typically set to provide a lifetime of several hundred to 2,000 hours for lamps used for general illumination theatrical photographic and projection lamps may have a useful life of only a few hours trading life expectancy for high output in a compact form long-life general service lamps have lower efficiency but are used where the cost of changing the lamp is high compared to the value of energy used if a light bulb envelope leaks the hot tungsten filament reacts with air yielding an aerosol of brown tungsten nitride brown tungsten dioxide violet-blue tungsten pentoxide and yellow tungsten trioxide that then deposits on the nearby surfaces or the bulb interior bulb blackening in a conventional lamp the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses on the inner surface of the glass envelope darkening it for bulbs that contain a vacuum the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope when a filling of inert gas is used the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just that portion of the envelope an incandescent lamp that gives 93 or less of its initial light output at 75 of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory when tested according to iec publication 60064 light loss is due to filament evaporation and bulb blackening 100 study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of the edison effect thermionic emission and invention of the vacuum tube a very small amount of water vapor inside a light bulb can significantly affect lamp darkening water vapor dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen at the hot filament the oxygen attacks the tungsten metal and the resulting tungsten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide reforming water vapor and continuing this water cycle 59 the equivalent of a drop of water distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening 58 small amounts of substances such as zirconium are placed within the lamp as a getter to react with any oxygen that may bake out of the lamp components during operation some old high-powered lamps used in theater projection searchlight and lighthouse service with heavy sturdy filaments contained loose tungsten powder within the envelope from time to time the operator would remove the bulb and shake it allowing the tungsten powder to scrub off most of the tungsten that had condensed on the interior of the envelope removing the blackening and brightening the lamp again 101 halogen lamps the halogen lamp reduces uneven evaporation of the filament and eliminates darkening of the envelope by filling the lamp with a halogen gas at low pressure rather than an inert gas the halogen cycle increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten from the inside of the bulb back onto the filament the halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space fiber-optic lamps for optical microscopy is one typical application incandescent arc lamps a variation of the incandescent lamp did not use a hot wire filament but instead used an arc struck on a spherical bead electrode to produce heat the electrode then became incandescent with the arc contributing little to the light produced such lamps were used for projection or illumination for scientific instruments such as microscopes these arc lamps ran on relatively low voltages and incorporated tungsten filaments to start ionization within the envelope they provided the intense concentrated light of an arc lamp but were easier to operate developed around 1915 these lamps were displaced by mercury and xenon arc lamps 102 103 104 electrical characteristics power incandescent lamps are nearly pure resistive loads with a power factor of 1 this means the actual power consumed in watts and the apparent power in volt-amperes are equal incandescent light bulbs are usually marketed according to the electrical power consumed this is measured in watts and depends mainly on the resistance of the filament which in turn depends mainly on the filaments length thickness and material for two bulbs of the same voltage type color and clarity the higher-powered bulb gives more light the table shows the approximate typical output in lumens of standard incandescent light bulbs at various powers light output of a 230 v version is usually slightly less than that of a 120 v version the lower current higher voltage filament is thinner and has to be operated at a slightly lower temperature for same life expectancy and that reduces energy efficiency 107 the lumen values for soft white bulbs will generally be slightly lower than for clear bulbs at the same power current and resistance the actual resistance of the filament is temperature dependent the cold resistance of tungsten-filament lamps is about 1/15 the hot-filament resistance when the lamp is operating for example a 100-watt 120-volt lamp has a resistance of 144 ohms when lit but the cold resistance is much lower about 9.5 ohms 58 108 since incandescent lamps are resistive loads simple phase-control triac dimmers can be used to control brightness electrical contacts may carry a t rating symbol indicating that they are designed to control circuits with the high inrush current characteristic of tungsten lamps for a 100-watt 120-volt general-service lamp the current stabilizes in about 0.10 seconds and the lamp reaches 90 of its full brightness after about 0.13 seconds 109 carbon filament bulbs have the opposite characteristic the resistance of a carbon filament is higher when it is cold than when it is operating in the case of a 240volt 60watt carbon filament bulb the resistance of the filament when at operating temperature is 960ohms but rises to around 1500ohms when coldcitation needed physical characteristics bulb shapes incandescent light bulbs come in a range of shapes and sizes the names of the shapes vary somewhat from region to regions many of these shapes have a designation consisting of one or more letters followed by one or more numbers eg a55 or par38 the letters represent the shape of the bulb the numbers represent the maximum diameter either in  1⁄8 of an inch or in millimeters depending on the shape and the region for example 63mm reflectors are designated r63 but in the us they are known as r20  2.5in 110 however in both regions a par38 reflector is known as par38citation needed examples common shapes lamp bases very small lamps may have the filament support wires extended through the base of the lamp and can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board for connections some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires in the late 19th century manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases general electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the mazda trademark in 1909 this standard was soon adopted across the us and the mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945 today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an edison screw in candelabra intermediate or standard or mogul sizes or double contact bayonet base technical standards for lamp bases include ansi standard c81.67 and iec standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturers products bayonet base lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration a bipin base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps 113 lamp bases may be secured to the bulb with a cement or by mechanical crimping to indentations molded into the glass bulb miniature lamps used for some automotive lamps or decorative lamps have wedge bases that have a partial plastic or even completely glass base in this case the wires wrap around to the outside of the bulb where they press against the contacts in the socket miniature christmas bulbs use a plastic wedge base as well lamps intended for use in optical systems such as film projectors microscope illuminators or stage lighting instruments have bases with alignment features so that the filament is positioned accurately within the optical system a screw-base lamp may have a random orientation of the filament when the lamp is installed in the socket light output and lifetime incandescent lamps are very sensitive to changes in the supply voltage these characteristics are of great practical and economic importance for a supply voltage v near the rated voltage of the lamp light output is approximately proportional to v 3.4 power consumption is approximately proportional to v 1.6 lifetime is approximately proportional to v −16 color temperature is approximately proportional to v 0.42 114 this means that a 5 reduction in operating voltage will more than double the life of the bulb at the expense of reducing its light output by about 16 this may be a very acceptable trade off for a light bulb that is in a difficult-to-access location for example traffic lights or fixtures hung from high ceilings long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off since the value of the electric power they consume is much more than the value of the lamp general service lamps emphasize efficiency over long operating life the objective is to minimize the cost of light not the cost of lamps 58 early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours but in 1924 a cartel agreed to limit life to 1000 hours 115 when this was exposed in 1953 general electric and other leading american manufacturers were banned from limiting the life 116 the relationships above are valid for only a few percent change of voltage around rated conditions but they do indicate that a lamp operated at much lower than rated voltage could last for hundreds of times longer than at rated conditions albeit with greatly reduced light output the centennial light is a light bulb that is accepted by the guinness book of world records as having been burning almost continuously at a fire station in livermore california since 1901 however the bulb emits the equivalent light of a four watt bulb a similar story can be told of a 40-watt bulb in texas that has been illuminated since 21 september 1908 it once resided in an opera house where notable celebrities stopped to take in its glow and was moved to an area museum in 1977 117 in flood lamps used for photographic lighting the tradeoff is made in the other direction compared to general-service bulbs for the same power these bulbs produce far more light and more importantly light at a higher color temperature at the expense of greatly reduced life which may be as short as two hours for a type p1 lamp the upper temperature limit for the filament is the melting point of the metal tungsten is the metal with the highest melting point 3,695k  6,191f a 50-hour-life projection bulb for instance is designed to operate only 50c  122f below that melting point such a lamp may achieve up to 22 lumens per watt compared with 17.5 for a 750-hour general service lamp 58 lamps designed for different voltages have different luminous efficacy for example a 100-watt 120-volt lamp will produce about 17.1 lumens per watt a lamp with the same rated lifetime but designed for 230 v would produce only around 12.8 lumens per watt and a similar lamp designed for 30 volts train lighting would produce as much as 19.8 lumens per watt 58 lower voltage lamps have a thicker filament for the same power rating they can run hotter for the same lifetime before the filament evaporates the wires used to support the filament make it mechanically stronger but remove heat creating another tradeoff between efficiency and long life many general-service 120-volt lamps use no additional support wires but lamps designed for rough service or vibration service may have as many as five low-voltage lamps have filaments made of heavier wire and do not require additional support wires very low voltages are inefficient since the lead wires would conduct too much heat away from the filament so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts very long filaments for high voltages are fragile and lamp bases become more difficult to insulate so lamps for illumination are not made with rated voltages over 300 volts 58 some infrared heating elements are made for higher voltages but these use tubular bulbs with widely separated terminals see also energy portal flash photography lampshade light tube lightbulb jokes list of
