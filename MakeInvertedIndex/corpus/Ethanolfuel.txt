ethanol fuel biofuel biomass geothermal hydropower solar energy tidal power wave power wind power topics by country 100 renewable energy marketing and policy trends v t e ethanol fuel is ethyl alcohol the same type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages used as fuel it is most often used as a motor fuel mainly as a biofuel additive for gasoline the first production car running entirely on ethanol was the fiat 147 introduced in 1978 in brazil by fiat nowadays cars are able to run using 100 ethanol fuel or a mix of ethanol and gasoline aka flex-fuel it is commonly made from biomass such as corn or sugarcane world ethanol production for transport fuel tripled between 2000 and 2007 from 17×109 liters  4.5×109usgal 3.7×109impgal to more than 52×109 liters  1.4×1010usgal 1.1×1010impgal from 2007 to 2008 the share of ethanol in global gasoline type fuel use increased from 3.7 to 5.4 1 in 2011 worldwide ethanol fuel production reached 22.36×109 us gallons  8.46×1010 liters 1.862×1010 imperial gallons with the united states as the top producer with 13.9×109 us gallons  5.3×1010 liters 1.16×1010 imperial gallons accounting for 62.2 of global production followed by brazil with 5.6×109 us gallons  2.1×1010 liters 4.7×109 imperial gallons 2 ethanol fuel has a gasoline gallon equivalency gge value of 1.5 us gallons  5.7l 1.2impgal which means 1.5 us gallons of ethanol produces the energy of one us gallon  3.8l 0.83impgal of gasoline 3 ethanol fuel is widely used in brazil and in the united states and together both countries were responsible for 87.1 of the worlds ethanol fuel production in 2011 2 most cars on the road today in the us can run on blends of up to 10 ethanol 4 and ethanol represented 10 of the us gasoline fuel supply derived from domestic sources in 2011 2 since 1976 the brazilian government has made it mandatory to blend ethanol with gasoline and since 2007 the legal blend is around 25 ethanol and 75 gasoline e25 5 by december 2011 brazil had a fleet of 14.8 million flex-fuel automobiles and light trucks 6 7 and 1.5 million flex-fuel motorcycles 8 9 10 that regularly use neat ethanol fuel known as e100 bioethanol is a form of quasi-renewable energy that can be produced from agricultural feedstocks it can be made from very common crops such as hemp sugarcane potato cassava and corn there has been considerable debate about how useful bioethanol is in replacing gasoline concerns about its production and use relate to increased food prices due to the large amount of arable land required for crops 11 as well as the energy and pollution balance of the whole cycle of ethanol production especially from corn 12 13 recent developments with cellulosic ethanol production and commercialization may allay some of these concerns 14 cellulosic ethanol offers promise because cellulose fibers a major and universal component in plant cells walls can be used to produce ethanol 15 16 according to the international energy agency cellulosic ethanol could allow ethanol fuels to play a much bigger role in the future 17  contents 1 chemistry 2 sources 3 production 3.1 fermentation 3.2 distillation 3.3 dehydration 3.4

dioxide ethanol fermentation is not 100 selective with other side products such as acetic acid glycols and many other products produced they are mostly removed during ethanol purification fermentation takes place in an aqueous solution the resulting solution has an ethanol content of around 15 ethanol is subsequently isolated and purified by a combination of adsorption and distillation during combustion ethanol reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide water and heat starch and cellulose molecules are strings of glucose molecules it is also possible to generate ethanol out of cellulosic materials that however requires a pretreatment that splits the cellulose into glycose molecules and other sugars that subsequently can be fermented the resulting product is called cellulosic ethanol indicating its source ethanol may also be produced industrially from ethylene by hydration of the double bond in the presence of catalysts and high temperature by far the largest fraction of the global ethanol production however is produced by fermentation sourcesedit about 5 of the ethanol produced in the world in 2003 was actually a petroleum product 18 it is made by the catalytic hydration of ethylene with sulfuric acid as the catalyst it can also be obtained via ethylene or acetylene from calcium carbide coal oil gas and other sources two million short tons  1,786,000 long tons 1,814,000t of petroleum-derived ethanol are produced annually the principal suppliers are plants in the united states europe and south africa 19 petroleum derived ethanol synthetic ethanol is chemically identical to bio-ethanol and can be differentiated only by radiocarbon dating 20 bio-ethanol is usually obtained from the conversion of carbon-based feedstock agricultural feedstocks are considered renewable because they get energy from the sun using photosynthesis provided that all minerals required for growth such as nitrogen and phosphorus are returned to the land ethanol can be produced from a variety of feedstocks such as sugar cane bagasse miscanthus sugar beet sorghum grain switchgrass barley hemp kenaf potatoes sweet potatoes cassava sunflower fruit molasses corn stover grain wheat straw cotton other biomass as well as many types of cellulose waste and harvesting whichever has the best well-to-wheel assessment an alternative process to produce bio-ethanol from algae is being developed by the company algenol rather than grow algae and then harvest and ferment it the algae grow in sunlight and produce ethanol directly which is removed without killing the algae it is claimed the process can produce 6,000 us gallons per acre  5,000 imperial gallons per acre 56,000 liters per hectare per year compared with 400 us gallons per acre  330impgalacre 3,700lha for corn production 21 currently the first generation processes for the production of ethanol from corn use only a small part of the corn plant the corn kernels are taken from the corn plant and only the starch which represents about 50 of the dry kernel mass is transformed into ethanol two types of second generation processes are under development the first type uses enzymes and yeast fermentation to convert the plant cellulose into ethanol while the second type uses pyrolysis to convert the whole plant to either a liquid bio-oil or a syngas second generation processes can also be used with plants such as grasses wood or agricultural waste material such as straw productionedit the basic steps for large-scale production of ethanol are microbial yeast fermentation of sugars distillation dehydration requirements vary see ethanol fuel mixtures below and denaturing optional prior to fermentation some crops require saccharification or hydrolysis of carbohydrates such as cellulose and starch into sugars saccharification of cellulose is called cellulolysis see cellulosic ethanol enzymes are used to convert starch into sugar 22 fermentationedit ethanol is produced by microbial fermentation of the sugar microbial fermentation currently only works directly with sugars two major components of plants starch and cellulose are both made of sugarsand can in principle be converted to sugars for fermentation currently only the sugar eg sugar cane and starch eg corn portions can be economically converted there is much activity in the area of cellulosic ethanol where the cellulose part of a plant is broken down to sugars and subsequently converted to ethanol distillationedit for the ethanol to be usable as a fuel the majority of the water must be removed most of the water is removed by distillation but the purity is limited to 95–96 due to the formation of a low-boiling water-ethanol azeotrope with maximum  95.6 mm  96.5 vv ethanol and 4.4 mm  3.5 vv water this mixture is called hydrous ethanol and can be used as a fuel alone but unlike anhydrous ethanol hydrous ethanol is not miscible in all ratios with gasoline so the water fraction is typically removed in further treatment to burn in combination with gasoline in gasoline engines 23 dehydrationedit there are basically three dehydration processes to remove the water from an azeotropic ethanolwater mixture the first process used in many early fuel ethanol plants is called azeotropic distillation and consists of adding benzene or cyclohexane to the mixture when these components are added to the mixture it forms a heterogeneous azeotropic mixture in vaporliquid-liquid equilibrium which when distilled produces anhydrous ethanol in the column bottom and a vapor mixture of water ethanol and cyclohexanebenzene when condensed this becomes a two-phase liquid mixture the heavier phase poor in the entrainer benzene or cyclohexane is stripped of the entrainer and recycled to the feedwhile the lighter phase with condensate from the stripping is recycled to the second column another early method called extractive distillation consists of adding a ternary component that increases ethanols relative volatility when the ternary mixture is distilled it produces anhydrous ethanol on the top stream of the column with increasing attention being paid to saving energy many methods have been proposed that avoid distillation altogether for dehydration of these methods a third method has emerged and has been adopted by the majority of modern ethanol plants this new process uses molecular sieves to remove water from fuel ethanol in this process ethanol vapor under pressure passes through a bed of molecular sieve beads the beads pores are sized to allow absorption of water while excluding ethanol after a period of time the bed is regenerated under vacuum or in the flow of inert atmosphere eg n2 to remove the absorbed water two beds are often used so that one is available to absorb water while the other is being regenerated this dehydration technology can account for energy saving of 3,000 btusgallon  840 kjl compared to earlier azeotropic distillation 24 post-production water issuesedit ethanol is hygroscopic meaning it absorbs water vapor directly from the atmosphere because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the ethanol and may cause phase separation of ethanol-gasoline blends which causes engine stall containers of ethanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed this high miscibility with water means that ethanol cannot be efficiently shipped through modern pipelines like liquid hydrocarbons over long distances 25 the fraction of water that an ethanol-gasoline fuel can contain without phase separation increases with the percentage of ethanol 26 this shows for example that e30 can have up to about 2 water if there is more than about 71 ethanol the remainder can be any proportion of water or gasoline and phase separation does not occur the fuel mileage declines with increased water content the increased solubility of water with higher ethanol content permits e30 and hydrated ethanol to be put in the same tank since any combination of them always results in a single phase somewhat less water is tolerated at lower temperatures for e10 it is about 0.5 vv at 70 f and decreases to about 0.23 vv at −30 f 27 consumer production systemsedit while biodiesel production systems have been marketed to home and business users for many years commercialized ethanol production systems designed for end-consumer use have lagged in the marketplace in 2008 two different companies announced home-scale ethanol production systems the afs125 advanced fuel system 28 from allard research and development is capable of producing both ethanol and biodiesel in one machine while the e-100 microfueler 29 from e-fuel corporation is dedicated to ethanol only enginesedit fuel economyedit ethanol contains approx 34 less energy per unit volume than gasoline and therefore in theory burning pure ethanol in a vehicle reduces miles per us gallon 34 given the same fuel economy compared to burning pure gasoline however since ethanol has a higher octane rating the engine can be made more efficient by raising its compression ratio using a variable turbocharger the compression ratio can be optimized for the fuel making fuel economy almost constant for any blend 30 31 for e10  10 ethanol and 90 gasoline the effect is small ~3 when compared to conventional gasoline 32 and even smaller  1–2 when compared to oxygenated and reformulated blends 33 for e85  85 ethanol the effect becomes significant e85 produces lower mileage than gasoline and requires more frequent refueling actual performance may vary depending on the vehicle based on epa tests for all 2006 e85 models the average fuel economy for e85 vehicles resulted 25.56 lower than unleaded gasoline 34 the epa-rated mileage of current united states flex-fuel vehicles 35 should be considered when making price comparisons but e85 is a high performance fuel with an octane rating of about 94–96 and should be compared to premium 36 cold start during the winteredit high ethanol blends present a problem to achieve enough vapor pressure for the fuel to evaporate and spark the ignition during cold weather since ethanol tends to increase fuel enthalpy of vaporization 37 when vapor pressure is below 45 kpa starting a cold engine becomes difficult 38 to avoid this problem at temperatures below 11c  52f and to reduce ethanol higher emissions during cold weather both the us and the european markets adopted e85 as the maximum blend to be used in their flexible fuel vehicles and they are optimized to run at such a blend at places with harsh cold weather the ethanol blend in the us has a seasonal reduction to e70 for these very cold regions though it is still sold as e85 39 40 at places where temperatures fall below −12c  10f during the winter it is recommended to install an engine heater system both for gasoline and e85 vehicles sweden has a similar seasonal reduction but the ethanol content in the blend is reduced to e75 during the winter months 40 41 brazilian flex fuel vehicles can operate with ethanol mixtures up to e100 which is hydrous ethanol with up to 4 water which causes vapor pressure to drop faster as compared to e85 vehicles as a result brazilian flex vehicles are built with a small secondary gasoline reservoir located near the engine during a cold start pure gasoline is injected to avoid starting problems at low temperatures this provision is particularly necessary for users of brazils southern and central regions where temperatures normally drop below 15c  59f during the winter an improved flex engine generation was launched in 2009 that eliminates the need for the secondary gas storage tank 42 43 in march 2009 volkswagen do brasil launched the polo e-flex the first brazilian flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start 44 45 fuel mixturesedit in many countries cars are mandated to run on mixtures of ethanol all brazilian light-duty vehicles are built to operate for an ethanol blend of up to 25 e25 and since 1993 a federal law requires mixtures between 22 and 25 ethanol with 25 required as of mid july 2011 46 in the united states all light-duty vehicles are built to operate normally with an ethanol blend of 10 e10 at the end of 2010 over 90 percent of all gasoline sold in the us was blended with ethanol 47 in january 2011 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a waiver to authorize up to 15 of ethanol blended with gasoline e15 to be sold only for cars and light pickup trucks with a model year of 2001 or newer 48 49 beginning with the model year 1999 an increasing number of vehicles in the world are manufactured with engines that can run on any fuel from 0 ethanol up to 100 ethanol without modification many cars and light trucks a class containing minivans suvs and pickup trucks are designed to be flexible-fuel vehicles using ethanol blends up to 85 e85 in north america and europe and up to 100 e100 in brazil in older model years their engine systems contained alcohol sensors in the fuel andor oxygen sensors in the exhaust that provide input to the engine control computer to adjust the fuel injection to achieve stochiometric no residual fuel or free oxygen in the exhaust air-to-fuel ratio for any fuel mix in newer models the alcohol sensors have been removed with the computer using only oxygen and airflow sensor feedback to estimate alcohol content the engine control computer can also adjust advance the ignition timing to achieve a higher output without pre-ignition when it predicts that higher alcohol percentages are present in the fuel being burned this method is backed up by advanced knock sensors  used in most high performance gasoline engines regardless of whether they are designed to use ethanol or not  that detect pre-ignition and detonation other engine configurationsedit since 1989 there have also been ethanol engines based on the diesel principle operating in sweden 50 they are used primarily in city buses but also in distribution trucks and waste collectors the engines made by scania have a modified compression ratio and the fuel known as ed95 used is a mix of 93.6 ethanol and 3.6 ignition improver and 2.8 denaturants 51 the ignition improver makes it possible for the fuel to ignite in the diesel combustion cycle it is then also possible to use the energy efficiency of the diesel principle with ethanol these engines have been used in the united kingdom by reading transport but the use of bioethanol fuel is now being phased out a 2004 mit study and an earlier paper published by the society of automotive engineers identified a method to exploit the characteristics of fuel ethanol substantially more efficiently than mixing it with gasoline the method presents the possibility of leveraging the use of alcohol to achieve definite improvement over the cost-effectiveness of hybrid electric the improvement consists of using dual-fuel direct-injection of pure alcohol or the azeotrope or e85 and gasoline in any ratio up to 100 of either in a turbocharged high compression-ratio small-displacement engine having performance similar to an engine having twice the displacement each fuel is carried separately with a much smaller tank for alcohol the high-compression for higher efficiency engine runs on ordinary gasoline under low-power cruise conditions alcohol is directly injected into the cylinders and the gasoline injection simultaneously reduced only when necessary to suppress knock such as when significantly accelerating direct cylinder injection raises the already high octane rating of ethanol up to an effective 130 the calculated over-all reduction of gasoline use and co2 emission is 30 the consumer cost payback time shows a 4:1 improvement over turbo-diesel and a 5:1 improvement over hybrid the problems of water absorption into pre-mixed gasoline causing phase separation supply issues of multiple mix ratios and cold-weather starting are also avoided 52 53 in a 2008 study complex engine controls and increased exhaust gas recirculation allowed a compression ratio of 19.5 with fuels ranging from neat ethanol to e50 thermal efficiency up to approximately that for a diesel was achieved 54 this would result in the fuel economy of a neat ethanol vehicle to be about the same as one burning gasoline in june 2016 nissan announced plans to develop fuel cell vehicles powered by ethanol rather than hydrogen the fuel of choice by the other car manufacturers that have developed and commercialized fuel cell vehicles such as the hyundai tucson fcev toyota mirai and honda fcx clarity the main advantage of this technical approach is that it would be cheaper and easier to deploy the fueling infrastructure than setting up the one required to deliver hydrogen at high pressures as each hydrogen fueling station cost us$1 million to us$2 million to build 55 nissan plans to create a technology that uses liquid ethanol fuel as a source to generate hydrogen within the vehicle itself the technology uses heat to reform ethanol into hydrogen to feed what is known as a solid oxide fuel cell sofc the fuel cell generates electricity to supply power to the electric motor driving the wheels through a battery that handles peak power demands and stores regenerated energy the vehicle would include a tank for a blend of water and ethanol which is fed into an onboard reformer that splits it into pure hydrogen and carbon dioxide according to nissan the liquid fuel could be an ethanol-water blend at a 55:45 ratio nissan expects to commercialize its technology by 2020 55 experience by countryedit the worlds top ethanol fuel producers in 2011 were the united states with 13.9×109 us gallons  5.3×1010 litres 1.16×1010 imperial gallons and brazil with 5.6×109 us gallons  2.1×1010 liters 4.7×109 imperial gallons accounting together for 87.1 of world production of 22.36×109 us gallons  8.46×1010 liters 1.862×1010 imperial gallons 2 strong incentives coupled with other industry development initiatives are giving rise to fledgling ethanol industries in countries such as germany spain france sweden china thailand canada colombia india australia and some central american countries environmentedit energy balanceedit  experimental not in commercial production  depending on production method all biomass goes through at least some of these steps it needs to be grown collected dried fermented distilled and burned all of these steps require resources and an infrastructure the total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel is known as the energy balance or energy returned on energy invested figures compiled in a 2007 by national geographic magazine 59 point to modest results for corn ethanol produced in the us one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol the energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in brazil is more favorable with one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol energy balance estimates are not easily produced thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory for instance a separate survey reports that production of ethanol from sugarcane which requires a tropical climate to grow productively returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended as compared to corn which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended 60 a 2006 university of california berkeley study after analyzing six separate studies concluded that producing ethanol from corn uses much less petroleum than producing gasoline 61 carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas is emitted during fermentation and combustion this is canceled out by the greater uptake of carbon dioxide by the plants as they grow to produce the biomass 62 when compared to gasoline depending on the production method ethanol releases less greenhouse gases 63 64 air pollutionedit compared with conventional unleaded gasoline ethanol is a particulate-free burning fuel source that combusts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide carbon monoxide water and aldehydes the clean air act requires the addition of oxygenates to reduce carbon monoxide emissions in the united states the additive mtbe is currently being phased out due to ground water contamination hence ethanol becomes an attractive alternative additive current production methods include air pollution from the manufacturer of macronutrient fertilizers such as ammonia a study by atmospheric scientists at stanford university found that e85 fuel would increase the risk of air pollution deaths relative to gasoline by 9 in los angeles us a very large urban car-based metropolis that is a worst-case scenario 65 ozone levels are significantly increased thereby increasing photochemical smog and aggravating medical problems such as asthma 66 67 brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel gas chromatograph studies were performed of ambient air in são paulo brazil and compared to osaka japan which does not burn ethanol fuel atmospheric formaldehyde was 160 higher in brazil and acetaldehyde was 260 higher 68needs update carbon dioxideedit the calculation of exactly how much carbon dioxide is produced in the manufacture of bioethanol is a complex and inexact process and is highly dependent on the method by which the ethanol is produced and the assumptions made in the calculation a calculation should include the cost of growing the feedstock the cost of transporting the feedstock to the factory the cost of processing the feedstock into bioethanol such a calculation may or may not consider the following effects the cost of the change in land use of the area where the fuel feedstock is grown the cost of transportation of the bioethanol from the factory to its point of use the efficiency of the bioethanol compared with standard gasoline the amount of carbon dioxide produced at the tail pipe the benefits due to the production of useful bi-products such as cattle feed or electricity the graph on the right shows figures calculated by the uk government for the purposes of the renewable transport fuel obligation 69 the january 2006 science article from uc berkeleys erg estimated reduction from corn ethanol in ghg to be 13 after reviewing a large number of studies in a correction to that article released shortly after publication they reduce the estimated value to 7.4 a national geographic magazine overview article  2007 59 puts the figures at 22 less co2 emissions in production and use for corn ethanol compared to gasoline and a 56 reduction for cane ethanol carmaker ford reports a 70 reduction in co2 emissions with bioethanol compared to petrol for one of their flexible-fuel vehicles 70 an additional complication is that production requires tilling new soil 71 which produces a one-off release of ghg that it can take decades or centuries of production reductions in ghg emissions to equalize 72 as an example converting grass lands to corn production for ethanol takes about a century of annual savings to make up for the ghg released from the initial tilling 71 change in land useedit large-scale farming is necessary to produce agricultural alcohol and this requires substantial amounts of cultivated land university of minnesota researchers report that if all corn grown in the us were used to make ethanol it would displace 12 of current us gasoline consumption 73 there are claims that land for ethanol production is acquired through deforestation while others have observed that areas currently supporting forests are usually not suitable for growing crops 74 75 in any case farming may involve a decline in soil fertility due to reduction of organic matter 76 a decrease in water availability and quality an increase in the use of pesticides and fertilizers and potential dislocation of local communities 77 new technology enables farmers and processors to increasingly produce the same output using less inputs 73 cellulosic ethanol production is a new approach that may alleviate land use and related concerns cellulosic ethanol can be produced from any plant material potentially doubling yields in an effort to minimize conflict between food needs vs fuel needs instead of utilizing only the starch by-products from grinding wheat and other crops cellulosic ethanol production maximizes the use of all plant materials including gluten this approach would have a smaller carbon footprint because the amount of energy-intensive fertilisers and fungicides remain the same for higher output of usable material the technology for producing cellulosic ethanol is currently in the commercialization stage 16 17 using biomass for electricity instead of ethanoledit converting biomass to electricity for charging electric vehicles may be a more climate-friendly transportation option than using biomass to produce ethanol fuel according to an analysis published in science in may 2009 78 researchers continue to search for more cost-effective developments in both cellulosic ethanol and advanced vehicle batteries 79 health costs of ethanol emissionsedit for each billion ethanol-equivalent gallons of fuel produced and combusted in the us the combined climate-change and health costs are $469 million for gasoline $472–952 million for corn

stover or switchgrass 80 efficiency of common cropsedit as ethanol yields improve or different feedstocks are introduced ethanol production may become more economically feasible in the us currently research on improving ethanol yields from each unit of corn is underway using biotechnology also as long as oil prices remain high the economical use of other feedstocks such as cellulose become viable by-products such as straw or wood chips can be converted to ethanol fast growing species like switchgrass can be grown on land not suitable for other cash crops and yield high levels of ethanol per unit area 59 reduced petroleum imports and costsedit one rationale given for extensive ethanol production in the us is its benefit to energy security by shifting the need for some foreign-produced oil to domestically produced energy sources 88 89 production of ethanol requires significant energy but current us production derives most of that energy from coal natural gas and other sources rather than oil 90 because 66 of oil consumed in the us is imported compared to a net surplus of coal and just 16 of natural gas figures from 2006 91 the displacement of oil-based fuels to ethanol produces a net shift from foreign to domestic us energy sources according to a 2008 analysis by iowa state university the growth in us ethanol production has caused retail gasoline prices to be us $0.29 to us $0.40 per gallon lower than would otherwise have been the case 92 motorsportedit leon duray qualified third for the 1927 indianapolis 500 auto race with an ethanol-fueled car 93 the indycar series
