emissions from industry power plants small equipment such as lawn mowers and diesel generators and other sources of air pollution vehicle emission performance standardedit an emission performance standard is a limit that sets thresholds above which a different type of emission control technology might be needed while emission performance standards have been used to dictate limits for conventional pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen and oxides of sulfur nox and sox 1 this regulatory technique may be used to regulate greenhouse gasses particularly carbon dioxide co2 in the us this is given in pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour lbs co2mwhr and kilograms co2mwhr elsewhere americaedit canadaedit in canada the canadian environmental protection act 1999 cepa 1999 transfers the legislative authority for regulating emissions from on-road vehicles and engines to environment canada from transport canadas motor vehicle safety act the regulations align emission standards with the us federal standards and apply to light-duty vehicles eg passenger cars light-duty trucks eg vans pickup trucks sport utility vehicles heavy-duty vehicles eg trucks and buses heavy-duty engines and motorcycles 2 united states of americaedit in the united states emissions standards are managed by the environmental protection agency epa under federal law the state of california is allowed to promulgate more stringent vehicle emissions standards subject to epa approval and other states may choose to follow either the national or california standards california had produced air quality standards prior to epa with severe air quality problems in the los angeles metropolitan area la is the countrys second-largest city and relies much more heavily on automobiles and has less favorable meteorological conditions than the largest and third-largest cities new york and chicago californias emissions standards are set by the california air resources board known locally by its acronym carb by mid-2009 16 other states had adopted carb rules 3 given the size of the california market plus these other states many manufacturers choose to build to the carb standard when selling in all 50 states carbs policies have also influenced eu emissions standardscitation needed california is attempting to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles but faces a court challenge from the federal government the states are also attempting to compel the federal epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions which as of 2007 it has declined to do on may 19 2009 news reports indicate that the federal epa will largely adopt californias standards on greenhouse gas emissions california and several other western states have passed bills requiring performance-based regulation of greenhouse gases from electricity generation in an effort to decrease emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines faster the california air resources boards carl moyer program funds upgrades that are in advance of regulations the california arb standard for light vehicle emissions is a regulation of equipment first with verification of emissions second the property owner of the vehicle is not permitted to modify improve or innovate solutions in order to pass a true emissions only standard set for their vehicle therefore californias attempt at regulation of emissions is a regulation of equipment not of air quality this form of regulation prevents most grassroots type creative individuals from participating in the math science and engineering that could lead to breakthroughs in this area of research they are wholly excluded from modifying their property in any way that has not been extensively researched and approved by carb this could be entirely prevented by regulating and testing emissions only the epa has separate regulations for small engines such as groundskeeping equipment the states must also promulgate miscellaneous emissions regulations in order to comply with the national ambient air quality standards europeedit european unionedit the european union has its own set of emissions standards that all new vehicles must meet currently standards are set for all road vehicles trains barges and nonroad mobile machinery such as tractors no standards apply to seagoing ships or airplanes eu regulation no 443/2009 sets an average co2 emissions target for new passenger cars of 130 grams per kilometre the target is gradually being phased in between 2012 and 2015 a target of 95 grams per kilometre will apply from 2021 for light commercial vehicle an emissions target of 175 gkm applies from 2017 and 147 gkm from 2020 4 a reduction of 16 the eu introduced euro 4 effective january 1 2008 euro 5 effective january 1 2010 and euro 6 effective january 1 2014 these dates had been postponed for two years to give oil refineries the opportunity to modernize their plants ukedit several local authorities in the uk have introduced euro 4 or euro 5 emissions standards for taxis and licensed private hire vehicles to operate in their area 5 6 7 germanyedit according to the german federal automotive office 37.3  15.4 million cars in germany total car population 41.3 million conform to the euro 4 standard from jan 2009 asiaedit chinaedit due to rapidly expanding wealth and prosperity the number of coal power plants and cars on chinas roads is rapidly growing creating an ongoing pollution problem china enacted its first emissions controls on automobiles in 2000 equivalent to euro i standards chinas state environmental protection administration sepa upgraded emission controls again on july 1 2004 to the euro ii standard 8 more stringent emission standard national standard iii equivalent to euro iii standards went into effect on july 1 2007 9 plans are for euro iv standards to take effect in 2010 beijing introduced the euro iv standard in advance on january 1 2008 became the first city in mainland china to adopt this standard 10 hong kongedit from jan 1 2006 all new passenger cars with spark-ignition engines in hong kong must meet either euro iv petrol standard japanese heisei 17 standard or us epa tier 2 bin 5 standard for new passenger cars with compression-ignition engines they must meet us epa tier 2 bin 5 standard indiaedit bharat stage emission standards are emission standards instituted by the government of india to regulate the output of air pollutants from internal combustion engine equipment including motor vehicles the standards and the timeline for implementation are set by the central pollution control board under the ministry of environment  forests the standards based on european regulations were first introduced in 2000 progressively stringent norms have been rolled out since then all new vehicles manufactured after the implementation of the norms have to be compliant with the regulations as of 2014 the country is under a combination of euro 3 and euro 4-based norms euro 6 norms are planned to be introduced across the country by the april 1 2020 japanedit background starting june 10 1968 the japanese government passed the japanese air pollution control act which regulated all sources of air pollutants as a result of the 1968 law dispute resolutions were passed under the 1970 japanese air pollution dispute resolution act as a result of the 1970 law in 1973 the first installment of four sets of new emissions standards were introduced interim standards were introduced on january 1 1975 and again for 1976 the final set of standards were introduced for 1978 11 while the standards were introduced they were not made immediately mandatory instead tax breaks were offered for cars which passed them 12 the standards were based on those adopted by the original us clean air act of 1970 but the test cycle included more slow city driving to correctly reflect the japanese situation 13 the 1978 limits for mean emissions during a hot start test of co hydrocarbons and nox were 2.1 grams per kilometre  3.38gmi of co .25 grams per kilometre  0.40gmi of hc and .25 grams per kilometre  0.40gmi of nox respectively 13 maximum limits are 2.7 grams per kilometre  4.35gmi of co .39 grams per kilometre  0.63gmi of hc and .48 grams per kilometre  0.77gmi of nox the "10 - 15 mode hot cycle test used to determine individual fuel economy ratings and emissions observed from the vehicle being tested use a specific testing regime 14 15 16 in 1992 to cope with nox pollution problems from existing vehicle fleets in highly populated metropolitan areas the ministry of the environment adopted the japanese law concerning special measures to reduce the total amount of nitrogen oxides emitted from motor vehicles in specified areas called in short the motor vehicle nox law the regulation designated a total of 196 communities in the tokyo saitama kanagawa osaka and hyogo prefectures as areas with significant air pollution due to nitrogen oxides emitted from motor vehicles under the law several measures had to be taken to control nox from in-use vehicles including enforcing emission standards for specified vehicle categories the regulation was amended in june 2001 to tighten the existing nox requirements and to add pm control provisions the amended rule is called the law concerning special measures to reduce the total amount of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emitted from motor vehicles in specified areas or in short the automotive nox and pm law the nox and pm law introduces emission standards for specified categories of in-use highway vehicles including commercial goods cargo vehicles such as trucks and vans buses and special purpose motor vehicles irrespective of the fuel type the regulation also applies to diesel powered passenger cars but not to gasoline cars in-use vehicles in the specified categories must meet 1997/98 emission standards for the respective new vehicle type in the case of heavy duty engines nox  4.5 gkwh pm  0.25 gkwh in other words the 1997/98 new vehicle standards are retroactively applied to older vehicles already on the road vehicle owners have two methods to comply vehicles have a grace period between 8 and 12 years from the initial registration to comply the grace period depends on the vehicle type as follows light commercial vehicles gvw  2500kg 8 years heavy commercial vehicles gvw  2500kg 9 years micro buses  11-29 seats 10 years large buses  30 seats 12 years special vehicles based on a cargo truck or bus 10 years diesel passenger cars 9 years furthermore the regulation allows fulfillment of its requirements to be postponed by an additional 0.5-2.5 years depending on the age of the vehicle this delay was introduced in part to harmonize the nox and pm law with the tokyo diesel retrofit program the nox and pm law is enforced in connection with japanese vehicle inspection program where non-complying vehicles cannot undergo the inspection in the designated areas this in turn may trigger an injunction on the vehicle operation under the road transport vehicle law israeledit since january 2012 vehicles which do not comply with euro 6 emission values are not allowed to be imported to israel africaedit south
