despotic political movements into the organization 12 13 for the 2013 federal election gabriel was considered a possible candidate to challenge incumbent chancellor angela merkel but deemed too unpopular and undisciplined at the time 14 as a consequence he and the other members of the partys leadership agreed to nominate peer steinbrück after frank-walter steinmeier the partys parliamentary leader withdrew from the contest 15 during the election campaign gabriel became the first spd leader to address a party convention of alliance '90the greens in his speech he called for a redgreen

angela merkel in the federal election into a share of government after successfully navigating the three-month process of coalition negotiations and a ballot of about 475,000 party members who endorsed the accord 17 at the time he was widely considered to have negotiated skillfully particularly considering the relative weakness of his party which had received just over 25 percent of the vote in the elections against more than 41 percent for merkels conservative bloc 18 at an spd convention shortly after the elections however gabriel and the other members of the partys leadership were

delegates vote of confidence in december 2015  the lowest for an spd leader in 20 years 22 still he is widely seen as running in the 2017 federal elections given the lack of clear rivals and apparent

settlement clause in the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta between canada and the european union prompting a renegotiation that delayed the entry into force of the agreement 42 following the renegotiations he championed ceta to demonstrate the center-left partys business credentials 43 in a 2014 meeting with french economist thomas piketty whose best-selling work capital in the

which utilities are paid for providing backup electricity at times when power generated by renewable sources such as the sun and wind cannot supply the grid a free market backstopped by an emergency reserve will be cheaper and work just as well as capacity markets gabriel told handelsblatt 46 he later warned against a hasty exit from coal-fired power generation concerned that such a move could pile more pressure on producers still wrestling with the planned shutdown of nuclear plants by 2022 47 arms exportsedit early in his tenure as federal minister of economic affairs and energy gabriel vowed a much more cautious approach to licensing arms exports unnerving the sizeable defense industry and signaling a change in policy from the previous coalition government under which sales rose 48 in august 2014 he withdrew permission for rheinmetall to build a military training center east of moscow 49 gabriel is bound by pledges to his spd to reduce arms sales to states that abuse human rights and the rule of law or where such sales may contribute to political instability he has stated that controls over the final destination of small arms sold to such nations are still insufficient 50 however he also indicated that the government would not universally block deals with countries outside of germanys traditional alliances deals with such countries could be approved because of special foreign-policy or security interests 51 he suggested that in future the federal foreign office may be a more appropriate body for deciding whether to allow exports and called for common european arms exports 52 in late 2015 his ministry approved a merger of german tank maker krauss-maffei wegmann kmw with the french armoured vehicle maker nexter 53 digital policyedit in may 2014

and grant him clemency amplifying germanys political voice in a region in which its influence had largely been limited to economic issues in years past 60 he had been urged by mps and human rights organizations to take up badawis case before his trip 61 his outspoken criticism of saudi justice was unusual for western leaders visiting the country a close ally for the west in fighting terrorism and islamic state militants particularly given germanys status as saudi arabias third-largest source of imports 60 while the us state department had previously also criticized the badawi sentence us secretary of state john kerry did not talk about the case publicly when he visited riyadh only days before 60 during a subsequent trip to qatar gabriel called on the emir of qatar sheikh tamim bin
