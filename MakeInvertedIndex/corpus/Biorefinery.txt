biorefinery a biorefinery is a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels power heat and value-added chemicals from biomass the biorefinery concept is analogous to todays petroleum refinery which produce multiple fuels and products from petroleum 1 the international energy agency bioenergy task 42 on biorefineries has defined biorefining as the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of bio-based products food feed chemicals materials and bioenergy biofuels power andor heat by producing multiple products a biorefinery takes advantage of the various components in biomass and their intermediates therefore maximizing the value derived from the biomass feedstock a biorefinery could for example produce one or several low-volume but high-value chemical or nutraceutical products and a low-value but high-volume liquid transportation fuel such as biodiesel or bioethanol see also alcohol fuel 2 at the same time generating electricity and process heat through combined heat and power chp technology for its own use and perhaps enough for sale of electricity to the local utility the high-value products increase profitability the high-volume fuel helps meet energy needs and the power production helps to lower energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from traditional power plant facilities although some facilities exist that can be called bio-refineries the bio-refinery has yet to be fully realized future biorefineries may play a major role in producing chemicals and materials that are traditionally produced from petroleum  contents 1 examples 2 see also 3 references 4 external links  examplesedit the fully operational blue marble energy company has multiple biorefineries located in odessa wa and missoula mt canadas first integrated biorefinery developed on anaerobic digestion technology by himark biogas is located in hairy hill alberta the biorefinery utilizes source separated organics from the metro edmonton region open pen feedlot manure and food processing waste several potential biorefinery examples have been proposed starting from feedstocks such as tobacco flax straw and the residues from the production of bioethanol 3 chemrecs technology for black liquor gasification and production of second-generation biofuels such as biomethanol or biodme is integrated with a host pulp mill and utilizes a major sulfate or sulfite process waste product as feedstock 4 see alsoedit renewable energy portal energy portal biofuels biomass bioplastic carbon neutrality combined heat and power chp gasification renewable energy commercialization referencesedit external linksedit tactical biorefinery saccharification biosynergy biorefinery from biomass aqueous-phase reforming wisconsin biorefining development initiative biorefinery film active biorefinery facilities v t e alcohol algae fuel bagasse babassu oil biobutanol biodiesel biogas biogasoline corn stover ethanol cellulosic mixtures methanol stover corn stover straw cooking oil vegetable oil water hyacinth wood gas cellulosic mixtures corn stover vegetable oil barley cassava grape hemp maize oat palm oil potato rapeseed rice sorghum bicolor soybean sugarcane sugar beet sunflower wheat yam camelina sativa arundo big bluestem camelina chinese tallow duckweed jatropha curcas millettia pinnata miscanthus giganteus switchgrass wood fuel beccs bioconversion biomass heating systems biorefinery fischertropsch process industrial biotechnology pellets mill stove thermal depolymerization mill stove cellulosic ethanol commercialization energy content of biofuel energy crop energy forestry eroei food vs fuel issues sustainable biofuel gnd 7742513-3
