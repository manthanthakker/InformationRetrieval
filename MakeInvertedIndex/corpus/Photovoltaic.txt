photovoltaics photovoltaics pv covers the conversion of light into electricity using semiconducting materials that exhibit the photovoltaic effect a phenomenon studied in physics photochemistry and electrochemistry a typical photovoltaic system employs solar panels each comprising a number of solar cells which generate electrical power the first step is the photoelectric effect followed by an electrochemical process where crystallized atoms ionized in a series generate an electric current 1 pv installations may be ground-mounted rooftop mounted or wall mounted solar pv generates no pollution 2 the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity occurs without any moving parts photovoltaic systems have been used for fifty years in specialized applications standalone and grid-connected pv systems have been in use for more than twenty years 3 they were first mass-produced in 2000 when german environmentalists and the eurosolar organization got government funding for a ten thousand roof program 4 on the other hand grid-connected pv systems have the major disadvantage that the power output is dependent on direct sunlight so about 10-25 is lost if a tracking system is not used since the cell wil not be directly facing the sun at all times 5power output is also adversely affected by weather conditions such as the amount of dust and water vapour in the air or the amount of cloud cover 6 7 this means that in the national grid for example this power has to be made up by other power sources hydrocarbon nuclear hydroelectric or wind energy advances in technology and increased manufacturing scale have reduced the cost increased the reliability and increased the efficiency of photovoltaic instalations 3 8 and the levelised cost of electricity from pv is competitive on a kilowatt hour basis with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions 9 solar pv regularly costs usd 0.05-0.10 per kilowatt-hour kwh in europe china india south africa and the united states 10 in 2015 record low prices were set in the united arab emirates  5.84 centskwh peru  4.8 centskwh and mexico  4.8 centskwh in may 2016 a solar pv auction in dubai attracted a bid of 3 centskwh 10 net metering and financial incentives such as preferential feed-in tariffs for solar-generated electricity have supported solar pv installations in many countries 11 more than 100 countries now use solar pv after hydro and wind powers pv is the third renewable energy source in terms of globally capacity in 2014 worldwide installed pv capacity increased to 177 gigawatts gw which is two percent of global electricity demand 12 china followed by japan and the united states is the fastest growing market while germany remains the worlds largest producer both in per capita and absolute terms with solar pv providing seven percent of annual domestic electricity consumption 13 with current technology as of 2013 photovoltaics recoups the energy

environmental impacts of photovoltaic technologies 6.1 photovoltaic systems  etymologyedit the term photovoltaic comes from the greek φῶς phōs meaning light and from volt the unit of electro-motive force the volt which in turn comes from the last name of the italian physicist alessandro volta inventor of the battery electroاللالالchemical cell the term photo-voltaic has been in use in english since 1849 15 solar cellsedit photovoltaics are best known as a method for generating electric power by using solar cells to convert energy from the sun into a flow of electrons the photovoltaic effect refers to photons of light exciting electrons into a higher state of energy allowing them to act as charge carriers for an electric current the photovoltaic effect was first observed by alexandre-edmond becquerel in 1839 16 17 the term photovoltaic denotes the unbiased operating mode of a photodiode in which current through the device is entirely due to the transduced light energy virtually all photovoltaic devices are some type of photodiode solar cells produce direct current electricity from sun light which can be used to power equipment or to recharge a battery the first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other spacecraft but today the majority of photovoltaic modules are used for grid connected power generation in this case an inverter is required to convert the dc to ac there is a smaller market for off-grid power for remote dwellings boats recreational vehicles electric cars roadside emergency telephones remote sensing and cathodic protection of pipelines photovoltaic power generation employs solar panels composed of a number of solar cells containing a photovoltaic material materials presently used for photovoltaics include monocrystalline silicon polycrystalline silicon amorphous silicon cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium selenidesulfide 18 copper solar cables connect modules module cable arrays array cable and sub-fields because of the growing demand for renewable energy sources the manufacturing of solar cells and photovoltaic arrays has advanced considerably in recent years 19 20 21 solar photovoltaics power generation has long been seen as a clean energy technology which draws upon the planets most plentiful and widely distributed renewable energy source  the sun the technology is inherently elegant in that the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity occurs without any moving parts or environmental emissions during operation it is well proven as photovoltaic systems have now been used for fifty years in specialised applications and grid-connected systems have been in use for over twenty years cells require protection from the environment and are usually packaged tightly behind a glass sheet when more power is required than a single cell can deliver cells are electrically connected together to form photovoltaic modules or solar panels a single module is enough to power an emergency telephone but for a house or a power plant the modules must be arranged in multiples as arrays photovoltaic power capacity is measured as maximum power output under standardized test conditions stc in wp watts peak 22 the actual power output at a particular point in time may be less than or greater than this standardized or rated value depending on geographical location time of day weather conditions and other factors 23 solar photovoltaic array capacity factors are typically under 25 which is lower than many other industrial sources of electricity 24 current developmentsedit for best performance terrestrial pv systems aim to maximize the time they face the sun solar trackers achieve this by moving pv panels to follow the sun the increase can be by as much as 20 in winter and by as much as 50 in summer static mounted systems can be optimized by analysis of the sun path panels are often set to latitude tilt an angle equal to the latitude but performance can be improved by adjusting the angle for summer or winter generally as with other semiconductor devices temperatures above room temperature reduce the performance of photovoltaics 25 a number of solar panels may also be mounted vertically above each other in a tower if the zenith distance of the sun is greater than zero and the tower can be turned horizontally as a whole and each panels additionally around a horizontal axis in such a tower the panels can follow the sun exactly such a device may be described as a ladder mounted on a turnable disk each step of that ladder is the middle axis of a rectangular solar panel in case the zenith distance of the sun reaches zero the ladder may be rotated to the north or the south to avoid a solar panel producing a shadow on a lower solar panel instead of an exactly vertical tower one can choose a tower with an axis directed to the polar star meaning that it is parallel to the rotation axis of the earth in this case the angle between the axis and the sun is always larger than 66 degrees during a day it is only necessary to turn the panels around this axis to follow the sun installations may be ground-mounted and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing 26 or built into the roof or walls of a building building-integrated photovoltaics another recent development involves the makeup of solar cells perovskite is a very inexpensive material which is being used to replace the expensive crystalline silicon which is still part of a standard pv cell build to this day michael graetzel director of the laboratory of photonics and interfaces at epfl says today efficiency has peaked at 18 percent but its expected to get even higher in the future 27 this is a significant claim as 20 efficiency is typical among solar panels which use more expensive materials efficiencyedit electrical efficiency also called conversion efficiency is a contributing factor in the selection of a photovoltaic system however the most efficient solar panels are typically the most expensive and may not be commercially available therefore selection is also driven by cost efficiency and other factors the electrical efficiency of a pv cell is a physical property which represents how much electrical power a cell can produce for a given insolation the basic expression for maximum efficiency of a photovoltaic cell is given by the ratio of output power to the incident solar power radiation flux times area the efficiency is measured under ideal laboratory conditions and represents the maximum achievable efficiency of the pv material actual efficiency is influenced by the output voltage current junction temperature light intensity and spectrumcitation needed the most efficient type of solar cell to date is a multi-junction concentrator solar cell with an efficiency of 46.0 29 produced by fraunhofer ise in december 2014 the highest efficiencies achieved without concentration include a material by sharp corporation at 35.8 using a proprietary triple-junction manufacturing technology in 2009 30 and boeing spectrolab  40.7 also using a triple-layer design the us company sunpower produces cells that have an efficiency of 21.5 well above the market average of 12–18 31 there is an ongoing effort to increase the conversion efficiency of pv cells and modules primarily for competitive advantage in order to increase the efficiency of solar cells it is important to choose a semiconductor material with an appropriate band gap that matches the solar spectrum this will enhance the electrical and optical properties improving the method of charge collection is also useful for increasing the efficiency there are several groups of materials that are being developed ultrahigh-efficiency devices η>30 32 are made by using gaas and gainp2 semiconductors with multijunction tandem cells high-quality single-crystal silicon materials are used to achieve high-efficiency low cost cells η>20 recent developments in organic photovoltaic cells opvs have made significant advancements in power conversion efficiency from 3 to over 15 since their introduction in the 1980s 33 to date the highest reported power conversion efficiency ranges from 6.7 to 8.94 for small molecule 8.4–10.6 for polymer opvs and 7 to 21 for perovskite opvs 34 35 opvs are expected to play a major role in the pv market recent improvements have increased the efficiency and lowered cost while remaining environmentally-benign and renewable several companies have begun embedding power optimizers into pv modules called smart modules these modules perform maximum power point tracking mppt for each module individually measure performance data for monitoring and provide additional safety features such modules can also compensate for shading effects wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to decrease 36 one of the major causes for the decreased performance of cells is overheating the efficiency of a solar cell declines by about 0.5 for every 1 degree celsius increase in temperature this means that a 100 degree increase in surface temperature could decrease the efficiency of a solar cell by about half self-cooling solar cells are one solution to this problem rather than using energy to cool the surface pyramid and cone shapes can be formed from silica and attached to the surface of a solar panel doing so allows visible light to reach the solar cells but reflects infrared rays which carry heat 37 growthedit  historical cumulative capacity  average projection for 2015 +55 gw 233gw  low scenario reaches 396gw by 2019  high scenario reaches 540gw by 2019 solar photovoltaics is growing rapidly and worldwide installed capacity reached at least 177 gigawatts gw by the end of 2014 the total power output of the worlds pv capacity in a calendar year is now beyond 200 twh of electricity this represents 1 of worldwide electricity demand more than 100 countries use solar pv 13 38 china followed by japan and the united states is now the fastest growing market while germany remains the worlds largest producer contributing more than 7 to its national electricity demands 13 photovoltaics is now after hydro and wind power the third most important renewable energy source in terms of globally installed capacity 39 several market research and financial companies foresee record-breaking global installation of more than 50gw in 2015 40 41 42 43 china is predicted to take the lead from germany and to become the worlds largest producer of pv power by installing another targeted 17.8gw in 2015 44 india is expected to install 1.8gw doubling its annual installations 42 by 2018 worldwide photovoltaic capacity is projected to doubled or even triple to 430gw solar power europe formerly known as epia also estimates that photovoltaics will meet 10 to 15 of europes energy demand in 2030 45 46 the epiagreenpeace solar generation paradigm shift scenario formerly called advanced scenario from 2010 shows that by the year 2030 1,845gw of pv systems could be generating approximately 2,646twhyear of electricity around the world combined with energy use efficiency improvements this would represent the electricity needs of more than 9 of the worlds population by 2050 over 20 of all electricity could be provided by photovoltaics 47 michael liebreich from bloomberg new energy finance anticipates a tipping point for solar energy the costs of power from wind and solar are already below those of conventional electricity generation in some parts of the world as they have fallen sharply and will continue to do so he also asserts that the electrical grid has been greatly expanded worldwide and is ready to receive and distribute electricity from renewable sources in addition worldwide electricity prices came under strong pressure from renewable energy sources that are in part enthusiastically embraced by consumers 48 deutsche bank sees a second gold rush for the photovoltaic industry to come grid parity has already been reached in at least 19 markets by january 2014 photovoltaics will prevail beyond feed-in tariffs becoming more competitive as deployment increases and prices continue to fall 49 in june 2014 barclays downgraded bonds of us utility companies barclays expects more competition by a growing self-consumption due to a combination of decentralized pv-systems and residential electricity storage this could fundamentally change the utilitys business model and transform the system over the next ten years as prices for these systems are predicted to fall 50  data iea-pvps snapshot of global pv 1992–2014 report march 2015 13:15 also see section deployment by country for a complete and continuously updated list environmental impacts of photovoltaic technologiesedit types of impacts while solar photovoltaic pv cells are promising for clean energy production their deployment is hindered by production costs material availability and toxicity life cycle assessment lca is one method of determining environmental impacts from pv many studies have been done on the various types of pv including first generation second generation and third generation usually these pv lca studies select a cradle to gate system boundary because often at the time the studies are conducted it is a new technology not commercially available yet and their required balance of system components and disposal methods are unknown 51 a traditional lca can look at many different impact categories ranging from global warming potential eco-toxicity human toxicity water depletion and many others most lcas of pv have focused on two categories carbon dioxide equivalents per kwh and energy pay-back time epbt the epbt is defined as  the time needed to compensate for the total renewable- and non-renewable- primary energy required during the life cycle of a pv system 52 a 2015 review of epbt from first and second generation pv 53 suggested that there was greater variation in embedded energy than in efficiency of the cells implying that it was mainly the embedded energy that needs to reduce to have a greater reduction in epbt one difficulty in determining impacts due to pv is to determine if the wastes are released to the air water or soil during the manufacturing phase 54 research is underway to try to understand emissions and releases during the lifetime of pv systems 54 impacts from first-generation pv crystalline silicon modules are the most extensively studied pv type in terms of lca since they are the most commonly used mono-crystalline silicon photovoltaic systems mono-si have an average efficiency of 14.0 55 the cells tend to follow a structure of front electrode anti-reflection film n-layer p-layer and back electrode with the sun hitting the front electrode epbt ranges from 1.7 to 2.7 years 56 the cradle to gate of co2-eqkwh ranges from 37.3 to 72.2 grams 57 techniques to produce multi-crystalline silicon multi-si photovoltaic cells are simpler and cheaper than mono-si however tend to make less efficient cells an average of 13.2 55 epbt ranges from 1.5 to 2.6 years 56 the cradle to gate of co2-eqkwh ranges from 28.5 to 69 grams 57 some studies have looked beyond epbt and gwp to other environmental impacts in one such study conventional energy mix in greece was compared to multi-si pv and found a 95 overall reduction in impacts including carcinogens eco-toxicity acidification eutrophication and eleven others 58 impacts from second generation cadmium telluride cdte is one of the fastest-growing thin film based solar cells which are collectively known as second generation devices this new thin film device also shares similar performance restrictions shockley-queisser efficiency limit as conventional si devices but promises to lower the cost of each device by both reducing material and energy consumption during manufacturing today the global market share of cdte is 5.4 up from 4.7 in 2008 54 this technologys highest power conversion efficiency is 21 59 the cell structure includes glass substrate around 2mm transparent conductor layer cds buffer layer  50–150nm cdte absorber and a metal contact layer cdte pv systems require less energy input in their production than other commercial pv systems per unit electricity production the average co2-eqkwh is around 18 grams cradle to gate cdte has the fastest epbt of all commercial pv technologies which varies between 0.3 and 1.2 years 60 copper indium gallium diselenide cigs is a thin film solar cell based on the copper indium diselenide cis family of chalcopyrite semiconductors cis and cigs are often used interchangeably within the ciscigs community the cell structure includes soda lime glass as the substrate mo layer as the back contact ciscigs as the absorber layer cadmium sulfide cds or zn sohx as the buffer layer and znoal as the front contact 61 cigs is approximately 1/100th the thickness of conventional silicon solar cell technologies materials necessary for assembly are readily available and are less costly per watt of solar cell cigs based solar devices resist performance degradation over time and are highly stable in the field reported global warming potential impacts of cigs range from 20.5  58.8 grams co2-eqkwh

found 1.393 years 53 toxicity is an issue within the buffer layer of cigs modules because it contains cadmium and gallium 51 63 cis modules do not contain any heavy metals impacts from third generation third-generation pvs are designed to combine the advantages of both the first and second generation devices and they do not have shockley-queisser efficiency limit a theoretical limit for first and second generation pv cells the thickness of a third generation device is less than 1µm 64 one emerging alternative and promising technology is based on an organic-inorganic hybrid solar cell made of methylammonium lead halide perovskites perovskite pv cells have progressed rapidly over the past few years and have become one of the most attractive areas for pv research 65 the cell structure includes a metal back contact which can be made of al au or ag a hole transfer layer spiro-meotad p3ht ptaa cuscn cui or nio and absorber layer ch3nh3pbixbr3-x ch3nh3pbixcl3-x or ch3nh3pbi3 an electron transport layer tio zno al2o3 or sno2 and a top contact layer fluorine doped tin oxide or tin doped indium oxide there are a limited number of published studies to address the environmental impacts of perovskite solar cells 66 67  65 the major environmental concern is the lead used in the absorber layer due to the instability of perovskite cells lead may eventually be exposed to fresh water during the use phase these lca studies looked at human and ecotoxicity of perovskite solar cells and found they were surprisingly low and may not be an environmental issue 66 67 global warming potential of perovskite pvs were found to be in the range of 24–1500 grams co2-eqkwh electricity production similarly reported epbt of the published paper range from 0.2 to 15 years the large range of reported values highlight the uncertainties associated with these studies celik et al  2016 critically discussed the assumptions made in perovskite pv lca studieshttpwwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiis0927024816300605 two new promising thin film technologies are copper zinc tin sulfide cu2znsns4 or czts and zinc phosphide zn3p2 51 both of these thin films are currently only produced in the lab but may be commercialized in the future their manufacturing processes are expected to be similar to those of current thin film technologies of cigs and cdte respectively yet contrary to cigs and cdte czts and zn3p2 are made from earth abundant nontoxic materials and have the potential to produce more electricity annually than the current worldwide consumption 68 69 while czts and zn3p2 offer good promise for these reasons the specific environmental implications of their commercial production are not yet known global warming potential of czts and zn3p2 were found 38 and 30 grams co2-eqkwh while their corresponding epbt were found 1.85 and 0.78 years respectively 51 overall cdte and zn3p2 have similar environmental impacts but can slightly outperform cigs and czts 51 organic and polymer photovoltaic opv are a relatively new area of research the tradition opv cell structure layers consist of a semi-transparent electrode electron blocking layer tunnel junction holes blocking layer electrode with the sun hitting the transparent electrode opv replaces silver with carbon as an electrode material lowering manufacturing cost and making them more environmentally friendly 70 opv are flexible low weight and work well with roll-to roll manufacturing for mass production 71 opv uses only abundant elements coupled to an extremely low embodied energy through very low processing temperatures using only ambient processing conditions on simple printing equipment enabling energy pay-back times 72 current efficiencies range from 1–6.5 52 73 however theoretical analyses show promise beyond 10 efficiency 72 many different configurations of opv exist using different materials for each layer opv technology rivals existing pv technologies in terms of epbt even if they currently present a shorter operational lifetime a 2013 study analyzed 12 different configurations all with 2 efficiency the epbt ranged from 0.29–0.52 years for 1 m of pv 74 the average co2-eqkwh for opv is 54.922 grams 75 economicsedit source apricus 76 there have been major changes in the underlying costs industry structure and market prices of solar photovoltaics technology over the years and gaining a coherent picture of the shifts occurring across the industry value chain globally is a challenge this is due to the rapidity of cost and price changes the complexity of the pv supply chain which involves a large number of manufacturing processes the balance of system bos and installation costs associated with complete pv systems the choice of different distribution channels and differences between regional markets within which pv is being deployed further complexities result from the many different policy support initiatives that have been put in place to facilitate photovoltaics commercialisation in various countries 3 the pv industry has seen dramatic drops in module prices since 2008 in late 2011 factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00w mark the $1.00w installed cost is often regarded in the pv industry as marking the achievement of grid parity for pv technological advancements manufacturing process improvements and industry re-structuring mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years 3 financial incentives for photovoltaics such as feed-in tariffs have often been offered to electricity consumers to install and operate solar-electric generating systems government has sometimes also offered incentives in order to encourage the pv industry to achieve the economies of scale needed to compete where the cost of pv-generated electricity is above the cost from the existing grid such policies are implemented to promote national or territorial energy independence high tech job creation and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which cause global warming due to economies of scale solar panels get less costly as people use and buy moreas manufacturers increase production to meet demand the cost and price is expected to drop in the years to come solar cell efficiencies vary from 6 for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 44.0 with multiple-junction concentrated photovoltaics 77 solar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available photovoltaics are around 14–22 78 79 concentrated photovoltaics cpv may reduce cost by concentrating up to 1,000 suns through magnifying lens onto a smaller sized photovoltaic cell however such concentrated solar power requires sophisticated heat sink designs otherwise the photovoltaic cell overheats which reduces its efficiency and life to further exacerbate the concentrated cooling design the heat sink must be passive otherwise the power required for active cooling would reduce the overall efficiency and economy crystalline silicon solar cell prices have fallen from $76.67watt in 1977 to an estimated $0.74watt in 2013 80 this is seen as evidence supporting swansons law an observation similar to the famous moores law that states that solar cell prices fall 20 for every doubling of industry capacity 80 as of 2011 the price of pv modules has fallen by 60 since the summer of 2008 according to bloomberg new energy finance estimates putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries an alternative and consistent price decline figure of 75 from 2007 to 2012 has also been published 81 though it is unclear whether these figures are specific to the united states or generally global the levelised cost of electricity lcoe from pv is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions 9 particularly when the time of generation is included as electricity is worth more during the day than at night 82 there has been fierce competition in the supply chain and further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar lie ahead posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years 83 as time progresses renewable energy technologies generally get cheaper 84 85 while fossil fuels generally get more expensive the less solar power costs the more favorably it compares to conventional power and the more attractive it becomes to utilities and energy users around the globe utility-scale solar power can now be delivered in california at prices well below $100mwh $0.10kwh less than most other peak generators even those running on low-cost natural gas lower solar module costs also stimulate demand from consumer markets where the cost of solar compares very favorably to retail electric rates 86 as of 2011 the cost of pv has fallen well below that of nuclear power and is set to fall further the average retail price of solar cells as monitored by the solarbuzz group fell from $3.50watt to $2.43watt over the course of 2011 87 for large-scale installations prices below $1.00watt were achieved a module price of 0.60 eurowatt $0.78watt was published for a large scale 5-year deal in april 2012 88 by the end of 2012 the best in class module price had dropped to $0.50watt and was expected to drop to $0.36watt by 2017 89 in many locations pv has reached grid parity which is usually defined as pv production costs at or below retail electricity prices though often still above the power station prices for coal or gas-fired generation without their distribution and other costs however in many countries there is still a need for more access to capital to develop pv projects to solve this problem securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects 90 91 for example solarcity offered the first us asset-backed security in the solar industry in 2013 92 photovoltaic power is also generated during a time of day that is close to peak demand precedes it in electricity systems with high use of air conditioning more generally it is now evident that given a carbon price of $50ton which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5ckwh solar pv will be cost-competitive in most locations the declining price of pv has been reflected in rapidly growing installations totaling about 23gw in 2011 although some consolidation is likely in 2012 due to support cuts in the large markets of germany and italy strong growth seems likely to continue for the rest of the decade already by one estimate total investment in renewables for 2011 exceeded investment in carbon-based electricity generation 87 in the case of self consumption payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not brought from the grid additionally using pv solar power to charge dc batteries as used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles leads to greater efficiencies traditionally dc generated electricity from solar pv must be converted to ac for buildings at an average 10 loss during the conversion an additional efficiency loss occurs in the transition back to dc for battery driven devices and vehicles and using various interest rates and energy price changes were calculated to find present values that range from $2,057.13 to $8,213.64 analysis from 2009 93 for example in germany with electricity prices of 0.25 eurokwh and insolation of 900 kwhkw one kwp will save 225 euro per year and with installation cost of 1700 eurokwp means that the system will pay back in less than 7 years 94 manufacturingedit overall the manufacturing process of creating solar photovoltaics is simple in that it does not require the culmination of many complex or moving parts because of the solid state nature of pv systems they often have relatively long lifetimes anywhere from 10 to 30 years in order to increase electrical output of a pv system the manufacturer must simply add more photovoltaic components and because of this economies of scale are important for manufacturers as costs decrease with increasing output 95 while there are many types of pv systems known to be effective crystalline silicon pv accounted for around 90 of the worldwide production of pv in 2013 manufacturing silicon pv systems has several steps first polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure semi-conductor grade this is melted down when small amounts of boron a group iii element are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes typically using a seed crystal an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline the ingot may also be cast in a mold wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws and then go through surface etching before being cleaned next the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus a group v element which creates an n-type semiconducting surface to reduce energy losses an anti-reflective coating is added to the surface along with electrical contacts after finishing the cell cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation 96 crystalline silicon photovoltaics are only one type of pv and while they represent the majority of solar cells produced currently there are many new and promising technologies that have the potential to be scaled up to meet future energy needs another newer technology thin-film pv are manufactured by depositing semiconducting layers on substrate in vacuum the substrate is often glass or stainless-steel and these semiconducting layers are made of many types of materials including cadmium telluride cdte copper indium diselenide cis copper indium gallium diselenide cigs and amorphous silicon a-si after being deposited onto the substrate the semiconducting layers are separated and connected by electrical circuit by laser-scribing thin-film photovoltaics now make up around 20 of the overall production of pv because of the reduced materials requirements and cost to manufacture modules consisting of thin-films as compared to silicon-based wafers 97 other emerging pv technologies include organic dye-sensitized quantum-dot and perovskite photovoltaics opvs fall into the thin-film category of manufacturing and typically operate around the 12 efficiency range which is lower than the 12–21 typically seen by silicon based pvs because organic photovoltaics require very high purity and are relatively reactive they must be encapsulated which vastly increases cost of manufacturing and meaning that they are not feasible for large scale up dye-sensitized pvs are similar in efficiency to opvs but are significantly easier to manufacture however these dye-sensitized photovoltaics present storage problems because the liquid electrolyte is toxic and can potentially permeate the plastics used in the cell quantum dot solar cells are quantum dot sensitized dsscs and are solution processed meaning they are potentially scalable but currently they have not reached greater than 10 efficiency perovskite solar cells are a very efficient solar energy converter and have excellent optoelectric properties for photovoltaic purposes but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture 98 applicationsedit photovoltaic systemsedit a photovoltaic system or solar pv system is a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics it consists of an arrangement of several components including solar panels to absorb and directly convert sunlight into electricity a solar inverter to change the electric current from dc to ac as well as mounting cabling and other electrical accessories pv systems range from small roof-top mounted or building-integrated systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts to large utility-scale power stations of hundreds of megawatts nowadays most pv systems are grid-connected while stand-alone systems only account for a small portion of the market rooftop and building integrated systems concentrator photovoltaics photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector power stations rural electrification standalone systems floatovoltaics in transport telecommunication and signaling spacecraft applications specialty power systems advantagesedit the 122pw of sunlight reaching the earths surface is plentifulalmost 10,000 times more than the 13tw equivalent of average power consumed in 2005 by humans 128 this abundance leads to the suggestion that it will not be long before solar energy will become the worlds primary energy source 129 additionally solar electric generation has the highest power density global mean of 170wm2 among renewable energies 128 solar power is pollution-free during use production end-wastes and emissions are manageable using existing pollution controls end-of-use recycling technologies are under development 130 and policies are being produced that encourage recycling from producers 131 pv installations can operate for 100 years or even more 132 with little maintenance or intervention after their initial set-up so after the initial capital cost of building any solar power plant operating costs are extremely low compared to existing power technologies grid-connected solar electricity can be used locally thus reducing transmissiondistribution losses transmission losses in the us were approximately 7.2 in 1995 133 compared to fossil and nuclear energy sources very little research money has been invested in the development of solar cells so there is considerable room for improvement nevertheless experimental high efficiency solar cells already have efficiencies of over 40 in case of concentrating photovoltaic cells 134 and efficiencies are rapidly rising while mass-production costs are rapidly falling 135 in some states of the united states much of the investment in a home-mounted system may be lost if the home-owner moves and the buyer puts less value on the system than the seller the city of berkeley developed an innovative financing method to remove this limitation by adding a tax assessment that is transferred with the home to pay for the solar panels 136 now known as pace property assessed clean energy 30 us states have duplicated this solution 137 there is evidence at least in california that the presence of a home-mounted solar system can actually increase the value of a home according to a paper published in april 2011 by the ernest orlando lawrence berkeley national laboratory titled an analysis of the effects of residential photovoltaic energy systems on home sales prices in california the research finds strong evidence that homes with pv systems in california have sold for a premium over comparable homes without pv systems more specifically estimates for average pv premiums range from approximately $3.9 to $6.4 per installed watt dc among a large number of different model specifications with most models coalescing near $5.5watt that value corresponds to a premium of approximately $17,000 for a relatively new 3,100 watt pv system the average size of pv
