tidal wind carbon-neutral fuel electric vehicle fossil fuel phase-out green vehicle plug-in hybrid renewable energy portal environment portal v t e energy conservation refers to reducing energy consumption through using less of an energy service energy conservation differs from efficient energy use which refers to using less energy for a constant service 1 driving less is an example of energy conservation driving the same amount with a higher mileage vehicle is an example of energy efficiency energy conservation and efficiency are both energy reduction techniques energy conservation is a part of the concept of sufficiency even though energy conservation reduces energy services it can result in increased environmental quality national security personal financial security and higher savings 2 it is at the top of the sustainable energy hierarchy 3 it also lowers energy costs by preventing future resource depletion 4  contents 1 energy tax 2 building design 3 transportation

united states  energy taxedit some countries employ energy or carbon taxes to motivate energy users to reduce their consumption carbon taxes can allow consumption to shift to nuclear power and other alternatives that carry a different set of environmental side effects and limitations meanwhile taxes on all energy consumption stand to reduce energy use across the board while reducing a broader array of environmental consequences arising from energy production the state of california employs a tiered energy tax whereby every consumer receives a baseline energy allowance that carries a low tax as usage increases above that baseline the tax is increasing drastically such programs aim to protect poorer households while creating a larger tax burden for high energy consumers 5 building designedit one of the primary ways to improve energy conservation in buildings is to use an energy audit an energy audit is an inspection and analysis of energy use and flows for energy conservation in a building process or system to reduce the amount of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the outputs this is normally accomplished by trained professionals and can be part of some of the national programs discussed above in addition recent development of smartphone apps enable homeowners to complete relativily sophisticated energy audits themselves 6 building technologies and smart meters can allow energy users business and residential to see graphically the impact their energy use can have in their workplace or homes advanced real-time energy metering is able to help people save energy by their actions 7 in passive solar building design windows walls and floors are made to collect store and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer this is called passive solar design or climatic design because unlike active solar heating systems it doesnt involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices the key to designing a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local climate elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type thermal insulation thermal mass and shading passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings but existing buildings can be retrofitted transportationedit in the united states suburban infrastructure evolved during an age of relatively easy access to fossil fuels which has led to transportation-dependent systems of living zoning reforms that allow greater urban density as well as designs for walking and bicycling can greatly reduce energy consumed for transportation the use of telecommuting by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy as many americans now work in service jobs that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day 8 consumer productsedit consumers are often poorly informed of the savings of energy efficient products a prominent example of this is the energy savings that can be made by replacing an incandescent light bulb with a more modern alternative when purchasing light bulbs many consumers opt for cheap incandescent bulbs failing to take into account their higher energy costs and lower lifespans when compared to modern compact fluorescent and led bulbs although these energy-efficient alternatives have a higher upfront cost their long lifespan and low energy use can save consumers a considerable amount of money 10 the price of leds has also been steadily decreasing in the past five years due to improvement of the semiconductor technology many led bulbs on the market qualify for utility rebates that further reduce the price of purchase to the consumer 11 estimates by the us department of energy state that widespread adoption of led lighting over the next 20 years could result in about $265 billion worth of savings in united states energy costs 12 the research one must put into conserving energy is often too time consuming and costly for the average consumer when there are cheaper products and technology available using todays fossil fuels 13 some governments and ngos are attempting to reduce this complexity with ecolabels that make differences in energy efficiency easy to research while shopping 14 to provide the kind of information and support people need to invest money time and effort in energy conservation it is important to understand and link to peoples topical concerns 15 for instance some retailers argue that bright lighting stimulates purchasing however health studies have demonstrated that headache stress blood pressure fatigue and worker error all generally increase with the common over-illumination present in many workplace and retail settings 16 17 it has been shown that natural daylighting increases productivity levels of workers while reducing energy consumption 18 in warm climates where air conditioning is used any household device that gives off heat will result in a larger load on the cooling system items such as a stove dish washer clothes dryer hot water and incandescent lighting all add heat to the home low power or insulated versions of these devices give off less heat for the air conditioning to remove the air conditioning system can also improve in efficiency by using a heat sink that is cooler than the standard air heat exchanger such as geothermal or water in cold climates heating air and water is a major demand on household energy use by investing in newer technologies in the home significant energy reductions are possible heat pumps are a more efficient alternative to using electrical resistance heaters for warming air or water a variety of efficient clothes dryers are available and the classic clothes line requires no energy only time natural gas condensing boilers and hot air furnaces increase efficiency over standard hot flue models new construction implementing heat exchangers can capture heat from waste water or exhaust air in bathrooms laundry and kitchens in both warm and cold climate extremes airtight thermal insulated construction will largely determine the efficiency of a home insulation is added to minimize the flow of heat to or from the home but can be labor-intensive to retrofit to an existing home energy conservation by the countriesedit asiaedit despite the vital role energy efficiency is envisaged to play in cost-effectively cutting energy demand only a small part of its economic potential is exploited in the asia governments have implemented a range of subsidies such as cash grants cheap credit tax exemptions and co-financing with public-sector funds to encourage a range of energy-efficiency initiatives across several sectors governments in the asia-pacific region have implemented a range of information provision and labeling programs for buildings appliances and the transportation and industrial sectors information programs can simply provide data such as fuel-economy labels or actively seek to encourage behavioral changes such as japans cool biz campaign that encourages setting air conditioners at 28-degrees celsius and allowing employees to dress casually in the summer 19 more in pacific energy summit european unionedit at the end of 2006 the european union eu pledged to cut its annual consumption of primary energy by 20 by 2020 20 the european union energy efficiency action plan is long awaited directive 2012/27eu is on energy efficiency 21 as part of the eus save programme 22 aimed at promoting energy efficiency and encouraging energy-saving behaviour the boiler efficiency directive 23 specifies minimum levels of efficiency for boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels indiaedit petroleum conservation research association pcra is an indian government body created in 1977 and engaged in promoting energy efficiency and conservation in every walk of life in the recent past pcra has done mass media campaigns in television radio  print media an impact

crisis energy conservation has been an issue in japan all oil based fuel is imported so indigenous sustainable energy is being developed the energy conservation center promotes energy efficiency in every aspect of japan public entities are implementing the efficient use of energy for industries and research it includes projects such as the top runner program in this project new appliances are regularly tested on efficiency and the most efficient ones are made the standard lebanonedit in lebanon and since 2002 the lebanese center for energy conservation lcec has been promoting the development of efficient and rational uses of energy and the use of renewable energy at the consumer level it was created as a project financed by the international environment facility gef and the ministry of energy water mew under the management of the united nations development programme undp and gradually established itself as an independent technical national center although it continues to be supported by the united nations development programme undp as indicated in the memorandum of understanding mou signed between mew and undp on june 18 2007 nepaledit until recently nepal has been focusing on the exploitation of its huge water resources to produce hydro power demand side management and energy conservation was not in the focus of government action in 2009 bilateral development cooperation between nepal and the federal republic of germany has agreed upon the joint implementation of nepal energy efficiency programme the lead executing agencies for the implementation are the water and energy commission secretariat wecs the aim of the programme is the promotion of energy efficiency in policy making in rural and urban households as well as in the industry 24 due to the lack of a government organization that promotes energy efficiency in the country the federation of nepalese chambers of commerce and industry fncci has established the energy efficiency centre under his roof to promote energy conservation in the private sector the energy efficiency centre is a non-profit initiative that is offering energy auditing services to the industries the centre is also supported by nepal energy efficiency programme of deutsche gesellschaft für internationale zusammenarbeit 25 a study conducted in 2012 found out that nepalese industries could save 160,000 megawatt hours of electricity and 8,000 terajoule of thermal energy like diesel furnace oil and coal every year these savings are equivalent to annual energy cost cut of up to 6.4 billion nepalese rupees 26 27 as a result of nepal economic forum 2014 28 an economic reform agenda in the priority sectors was declared focusing on energy conservation among others in the energy reform agenda the government of nepal gave the commitment to introduce incentive packages in the budget of the fiscal year 2015/16 for industries that practices energy efficiency or use efficient technologies incl cogeneration 29
