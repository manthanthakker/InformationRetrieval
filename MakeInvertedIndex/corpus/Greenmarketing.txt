green marketing green marketing is the marketing of products that are presumed to be environmentally preferable to othersthus green marketing incorporates a broad range of activities including product modification changes to the production process sustainable packaging as well as modifying advertising yet defining green marketing is not a simple task where several meanings intersect and contradict each other an example of this will be the existence of varying social environmental and retail definitions attached to this termother similar terms used are environmental marketing and ecological marketing green environmental and eco-marketing are part of the new marketing approaches which do not just refocus adjust or enhance existing marketing thinking and practice but seek to challenge those approaches and provide a substantially different perspective in more detail green environmental and eco-marketing belong to the group of approaches which seek to address the lack of fit between marketing as it is currently practiced and the ecological and social realities of the wider marketing environmentbelz f peattie k 2009 sustainability marketing a global perspective john wiley  sons

1980s and early 1990s 2 the proceedings of this workshop resulted in one of the first books on green marketing entitled ecological marketing 3 the corporate social responsibility csr reports started with the ice cream seller ben  jerrys where the financial report was supplemented by a greater view on the companys environmental impact in 1987 a document prepared by the world commission on environment and development defined sustainable development as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own need this became known as the brundtland report and was another step towards widespread thinking on sustainability in everyday activity two tangible milestones for wave 1 of green marketing came in the form of published books both of which were called green marketing they were by ken peattie  1992 in the united kingdom and by jacquelyn ottman  1993 in the united states of america 4 according to jacquelyn ottman author of the new rules of green marketing strategies tools and inspiration for sustainable branding greenleaf publishing 5 and berrett-koehler publishers february 2011 from an organizational standpoint environmental considerations should be integrated into all aspects of marketing  new product development and communications and all points in between 6 the holistic nature of green also suggests that besides suppliers and retailers new stakeholders be enlisted including educators members of the community regulators and ngos environmental issues should be balanced with primary customer needscitation needed the past decade has shown that harnessing consumer power to effect positive environmental change is far easier said than done the so-called green consumer movements in the us and other countries have struggled to reach critical mass and to remain in the forefront of shoppers minds 7 while public opinion polls taken since the late 1980s have shown consistently that a significant percentage of consumers in the us and elsewhere profess a strong willingness to favor environmentally conscious products and companies consumers efforts to do so in real life have remained sketchy at best 8 one of green marketings challenges is the lack of standards or public consensus about what constitutes green according to joel makower a writer on green marketingcitation needed in essence there is no definition of how good is good enough when it comes to a product or company making green marketing claims this lack of consensusby consumers marketers activists regulators and influential peoplehas slowed the growth of green products says makower because companies are often reluctant to promote their green attributes and consumers are often skeptical about claimscitation needed despite these challenges green marketing has continued to gain adherents particularly in light of growing global concern about climate change this concern has led more companies to advertise their commitment to reduce their climate impacts and the effect this is having on their products and services 9 10 greenhouse gas reduction marketedit the emerging greenhouse gas reduction market can potentially catalyze projects with important local environmental economic and quality-of-life benefits the kyoto protocols clean development mechanism cdm for example enables trading between industrial and developing nations providing a framework that can result in capital flows to environmentally beneficial development activities although the united states is not participating in the kyoto protocol several us programs enable similar transactions on a voluntary and regulatory basis 8 while international trade in greenhouse gas 11 reductions holds substantial promise as a source of new funding for sustainable development this market can be largely inaccessible to many smaller-scale projects remote communities and least developed localities to facilitate participation and broaden the benefits several barriers must be overcome including a lack of market awareness among stakeholders and prospective participants specialized somewhat complicated participation rules and the need for simplified participation mechanisms for small projects without which transaction costs can overwhelm the financial benefits of participation if the barriers are adequately addressed greenhouse gas trading can play an important role supporting activities that benefit peoples lives and the environment 8 popularity and effectivenessedit ongoing debateedit the popularity of such marketing approach and its effectiveness is hotly debated supporters claim that environmental appeals are actually growing in numberthe energy star label for example now appears on 11,000 different companies 12 models in 38 product categories from washing machines and light bulbs to skyscrapers and homes however despite the growth in the number of green products green marketing is on the decline as the primary sales pitch for productscitation needed shel horowitz a green marketer for over 30 years and primary author of guerrilla marketing goes green 13 states that to market effectively green businesses need to market to three different audiences deep green lazy green and nongreen and that each must be approached differently each will have different trigger points that will move them to buy and for the nongreen audience marketing effectively usually requires emphasizing product superiority rather than care for the planet  14 on the other hand ropers green gauge shows that a high percentage of consumers  42 15 feel that environmental products dont work as well as conventional ones this is an unfortunate legacy from the 1970s when shower heads sputtered and natural detergents left clothes dingy given the choice all but the greenest of customers will reach for synthetic detergents over the premium-priced proverbial happy planet any day including earth day new reports however show a growing trend towards green products 16 confusionedit one challenge green marketers old and new are likely to face as green products and messages become more common is confusion in the marketplace consumers do not really understand a lot about these issues and theres a lot of confusion out there says jacquelyn ottmanfounder of j ottman consulting and author of green marketing opportunity for innovation 16 marketers sometimes take advantage of this confusion and purposely make false or exaggerated green claims critics refer to this practice as green washing greenwashingedit corporations are increasingly recognizing the benefits of green marketing although there is often a thin line between doing so for its own benefit and for social responsibility reasons the term greenwashing refers to all industries that adopt outwardly green acts with an underlying purpose to increase profits the primary objective of greenwashing is to provide consumers with the feeling that the organization is taking the necessary steps to responsibly manage its ecological footprint in reality the company may be doing very little that is environmentally beneficial 17 the term greenwashing was first used by environmentalist jay westerveld when objecting to hoteliers practice of placing notices in hotel rooms which asked their guests to reuse towels to save the environment westerveld noted that there was little else to suggest that the hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts and that their interest in washing fewer towels seemed to be motivated by a concern to save costs rather than the environment since then greenwashing has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability with awards for greenwashing established and numerous campaigns law and advices developed in an attempt to reduce or curb it 18 benefit corporationsedit in january 2012 patagonia became the first brand to register for benefit corporation status 19 a benefit corporation is an alternative to its standard counterpart as it operates under the legal premise of 1 creating a positive impact socially and environmentally in its materials 2 uphold corporate social responsibility in terms of considering its workers its community and the environment as well as challenge its current boundaries in those areas and 3 report its activity as a company as well as its achievements in social and environmental areas publicly using a non-partisan third party source statisticsedit according to market researcher mintel about 12 of the us population can be identified as true greens consumers who seek out and regularly buy so-called green products another 68 16 20 can be classified as light greens consumers who buy green sometimes what chief marketing officers are always looking for is touch points with consumers and this is just a big big big touch point thats not being served says mintel research director david lockwood all the corporate executives that we talk to are extremely convinced that being able to make some sort of strong case about the environment is going to work down to their bottom line 16 adoptabilityedit in 1989 67 percent of americans stated that they were willing to pay 5-10 percent more for ecologically compatible products 21 by 1991 environmentally conscious individuals were willing to pay between 15-20 percent more for green products 22 today more than one-third of americans say they would pay a little extra for green products 23 an important challenge facing marketers is to identify which consumers are willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products it is apparent that an enhanced knowledge of the profile of this segment of consumers would be extremely useful everett rogers communication scholar and author of diffusion of innovations claims that the following five factors can help determine whether a new idea will be adopted or not including the idealism of the shift towards green lohasedit lohas stands for lifestyles of health and sustainability and describes an integrated rapidly growing market for goods and services that appeal to consumers whose sense of environmental and social responsibility influences their purchase decisions the natural marketing institutes short nmi estimates the us lohas consumer market of products and services to be usd 209 billion  sold across all consumer segments 25 the five lohas segments as defined by nmi include lohas active environmental stewards dedicated to personal and planetary health these are the heaviest purchasers of green and socially responsible products and the early adopters who influence others heavily naturalites motivated primarily by personal health considerations they tend to purchase more lohas consumable products vs durable items drifters while their intentions may be good drifters follow trends when it is easy and affordable they are currently quite engaged in green purchasing behaviours conventionals pragmatists who embrace lohas behaviour when they believe they can make a difference but are primarily focused on being very careful with their resources and doing the right thing because it will save them money unconcerned either unaware or unconcerned about the environment and societal issues mainly because they do not have the time or the means  these consumers are largely focused on getting by the green marketing mixedit a model green marketing mix contains four ps product a producer should offer ecological products which not only must not contaminate the environment but should protect it and even liquidate existing environmental damages price prices for such products may be a little higher than conventional alternatives but target groups like for example lohas are willing to pay extra for green products place a distribution logistics is of crucial importance main focus is on ecological packaging marketing local and seasonal products eg vegetables from regional farms is more easy to be marketed green than products imported promotion a communication with the market should put stress on environmental aspects for example that the company possesses a cp certificate or is iso 14000 certified this may be publicized to improve a firms image furthermore the fact that a company spends expenditures on environmental protection should be advertised third sponsoring the natural environment is also very important and last but not least ecological products will probably require special sales promotionscitation needed additional social marketing ps that are used in this process are publics effective social marketing knows its audience and can appeal to multiple groups of people public is the external and internal groups involved in the program external publics include the target audience secondary audiences policymakers and gatekeepers while the internal publics are those who are involved in some way with either approval or implementation of the program partnership most social change issues including green initiatives are too complex for one person or group to handle associating with other groups and initiatives to team up strengthens the chance of efficacy policy social marketing programs can do well in motivating individual behavior change but that is difficult to sustain unless the environment theyre in supports that change for the long run often policy change is needed and media advocacy programs can be an effective complement to a social marketing program purse strings how much will this strategic effort cost who is funding the effort 26 the level of greeningstrategic quasi-strategic or tacticaldictates what activities should be undertaken by a company strategic greening in one area may or may not be leveraged effectively in others a firm could make substantial changes in production processes but opt not to leverage them by positioning itself as an environmental leader so although strategic greening is not necessarily strategically integrated into all marketing activities it is nevertheless strategic in the product area 27 ecolabelsedit an individuals belief that an environmental claim lacks honesty can have a negative effect on attitude toward a brand if on the other side the consumer grants credibility to the claim the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment the problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements this skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning and in particular the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques to resolve this problem independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations this practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of productsall of which should positively affect the purchase intention 28 life-cycle assessmentedit during the late 1980s new instruments such as life-cycle assessment lca were invented which allowed ecological considerations to be introduced into marketing decisions 18 the life cycle assessment model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout the life cycle of a product lca was developed according to iso 14040 the main goal of the lca is to define the energy and environmental profile of the finished products the reasons to use lca arose from the need to have a precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements that could be used in order to increase the environmental energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes in addition the purpose was to quantify the environmental advantages deriving from the use of recycled raw material 30 example for lcaedit lca is used for example in the building sector buildings today account for the 40 of the worlds energy use the resulting carbon emissions are substantially higher than those of the transportation sector new buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day and millions of todays inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050 its therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings in order to reduce the planets energy-related carbon footprint growing interest space and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building mineral vegetable or animal materials such as perlite vermiculite rock wool glass wool cork plant fibers cotton flax hemp coconut wood fiber cellulose and sheeps wool can be used for the production of insulation panels 30 green marketing casesedit phillipss marathon cfl lightbulbedit philips lightings first shot at marketing a standalone compact fluorescent light cfl bulb was earth light at $15 each versus 75 cents for incandescent bulbs 31 the product had difficulty climbing out of its deep green niche the company re-launched the product as marathon underscoring its new super long life positioning and promise of saving $26 in energy costs over its five-year lifetime 31 finally with the us epas energy star label to add credibility as well as new sensitivity to rising utility costs and electricity shortages sales climbed 12 percent in an otherwise flat market 32 car sharing servicesedit car-sharing services address the longer-term solutions to consumer needs for better fuel savings and fewer traffic tie-ups and parking nightmares to complement the environmental benefit of more open space and reduction of greenhouse gasescitation needed they may be thought of as a time-sharing system for cars consumers who drive less than 7,500 miles a year and do not need a car for work can save thousands of dollars annually by joining one of the many services springing up including zipcar east coast i-go car chicago 33 and hour car twin cities 34 electronics sectoredit the consumer electronics sector provides room for using green marketing to attract new customers one example of this is hps promise to cut its global energy use 20 percent by the year 2010 35 to accomplish this reduction below 2005 levels the hewlett-packard company announced plans to deliver energy-efficient products and services and institute energy-efficient operating practices in its facilities worldwide products and servicesedit now companies are offering more eco-friendly alternatives for their customers recycled products for example are one of the most popular alternatives that can benefit the environment these benefits include sustainable forestry clean air energy efficiency water conservation and a healthy office one example is the e-commerce business and office supply company shoplet which offers a web tool that allows you to replace similar items in your shopping cart with greener products introduction of cng in delhiedit new delhi capital of india was being polluted at a very fast pace until supreme court of india forced a change to alternative fuels in 2002 a directive was issued to completely adopt cng in all public transport systems to curb pollution 36 see alsoedit green banking green politics marketing social marketing referencesedit external
