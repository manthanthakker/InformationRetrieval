renewable energy in ethiopia ethiopia generates most of its electricity from renewable energy mainly hydropower on the blue nile in 2011 over 96 of ethiopias electricity was from hydropower 1 the country began a large program to expand electricity supply in the 2010s from 2,000 mw to 10,000 mw this was to be done mainly with renewable sources wind and geothermal were included to offset seasonal differences in water levels ethiopia plans to export electricity to neighboring countries but transmission lines will need to be upgraded and expanded most of the energy needs of ethiopia are filled by biofuels for cooking heating and off-grid lighting petroleum including gasoline diesel and kerosene supply less than 7 of the countries energy supply 1 solar photovoltaics is being promoted to replace fuel-based lighting and off-grid electrical supply with a solar panel assembly plant opening in addis ababa in early 2013 the majority of the ethiopias population live in rural areas and very few have access to electricity ethiopia is planning for a carbon-neutral status by 2025 2  contents 1 hydropower 2 wind power 3 solar 4 geothermal 5 biofuels 6 exports 7 references  hydropoweredit dams built in ethiopia provided over 1,500 mw of capacity by 2010 the four largest dams were built between 2004-2010 the grand ethiopian renaissance dam will be the largest hydropower dam in africa and among the largest in the world when completed it will be able to generate 6,000 mw almost triple ethiopias entire national capacity egypt has expressed concerns that their water rights are being violated by these upstream dams but ethiopia has no water treaty with egypt wind poweredit ethiopia plans 800 mw of wind powercitation needed as the dry season is also the windy season wind power is a good complement to hydropower the first wind installation in the country was the 51 mw adama i wind farm built in 2011citation needed the 120 mw ashegoda wind farm opened in october 2013 and was the largest wind farm in africa at that time 3 the larger 153 mw adama ii wind farm went online in may 2015 bringing ethiopias installed wind capacity to 324mw total 4 solaredit solar photovoltaics are being promoted to replace fuel-based lighting and off-grid electrical needs ethiopia is thought to have about 5 mw of off-grid solarcitation needed almost all current solar power is used for telecommunicationscitation needed other uses include village well pumps health care and school lighting a current government initiative plans to bring solar power to 150,000 households by 2015 the first phase included 1 mw of panels 5 the first large installation of solar was a village grid of 10 kw in 1985 expanded to 30 kw in 1989 a solar panel assembly plant opened in addis ababa in early 2013 capable of making 20 mw of panel per year 6 geothermaledit ethiopia has one geothermal plant the 7mw aluto langano geothermal pilot plant this is being expanded to 70mw in 2015 7 ethiopia is planning to build geothermal plants to offset restraints on power production by hydroplants due to seasonal water variation american-icelandic company reykjavik geothermal has an agreement to develop a 1000 mw geothermal farm 8 the first 500 mw would be completed by 2018 biofuelsedit the majority of ethiopias energy needs are met by biofuels fuelwood for cooking the government plans to distribute 9 million more efficient stoves by 2015 to reduce wood use while improving air quality and lowering co2 emissions 2 reduced use of firewood should also help the governments goal of reforestation exportsedit as ethiopia produces more power than it consumes it has become a regional power exporter in 2015 it sells electricity to kenya sudan and djibouti and has future contracts for power sales to tanzania rwanda south sudan and yemen 9 the eastern african power pool will expand transmission lines to make this possible exports to egypt and sudan are possible after the completion of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam 10 referencesedit v t e ethiopia kenya morocco seychelles afghanistan bangladesh bhutan china india kazakhstan nepal pakistan philippines taiwan thailand european union czech republic denmark finland germany greece hungary ireland italy lithuania luxembourg netherlands portugal spain sweden united kingdom albania iceland norway russia canada costa rica honduras mexico united states australia new zealand tuvalu argentina brazil chile colombia
