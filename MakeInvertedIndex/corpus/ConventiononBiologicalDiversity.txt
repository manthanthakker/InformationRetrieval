convention on biological diversity the convention on biological diversity cbd known informally as the biodiversity convention is a multilateral treaty the convention has three main goals in other words its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity it is often seen as the key document regarding sustainable development the convention was opened for signature at the earth summit in rio de janeiro on 5 june 1992 and entered into force on 29 december 1993 at the 2010 10th conference of parties cop to the convention on

humankind and is an integral part of the development process the agreement covers all ecosystems species and genetic resources it links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably it sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources notably those destined for commercial use it also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its cartagena protocol on biosafety addressing technology development and transfer benefit-sharing and biosafety issues importantly the convention is legally binding countries that join it parties are obliged to implement its provisions the convention reminds decision-makers that natural resources are not infinite and sets out a philosophy of sustainable use while past conservation efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats the convention recognizes that ecosystems species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans however this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity the convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the precautionary principle that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat the convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve biological diversity it argues however that conservation will bring us significant environmental economic and social benefits in return the convention on biological diversity of 2010 would ban some forms of geoengineering issuesedit some of the many issues dealt with under the convention include measures the incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity regulated access to genetic resources and traditional knowledge including prior informed consent of the party providing resources sharing in a fair and equitable way the results of research and development and the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of genetic resources with the contracting party providing such resources governments andor local communities that provided the traditional knowledge or biodiversity resources utilized access to and transfer of technology including biotechnology to the governments andor local communities that provided traditional knowledge andor biodiversity resources technical and scientific cooperation coordination of a global directory of taxonomic expertise global taxonomy initiative impact assessment education and public awareness provision of financial resources national reporting on efforts to implement treaty commitments cartagena protocoledit the cartagena protocol on biosafety of the convention also known as the biosafety protocol was adopted in january 2000 the biosafety protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology the biosafety protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the precautionary principle and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits it will for example let countries ban imports of a genetically modified organism if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is safe and requires exporters to label shipments containing genetically modified commodities such as corn or cotton the required number of 50 instruments of ratificationaccessionapprovalacceptance by countries was reached in may 2003 in accordance with the provisions of its article 37 the protocol entered into force on 11 september 2003 global strategy for plant conservationedit in april 2002 the parties of the un cbd adopted the recommendations of the gran canaria declaration calling for a global plant conservation

nbsapedit national biodiversity strategies and action plans nbsaps are the principal instruments for implementing the convention at the national level article 6 the convention requires countries to prepare a national biodiversity strategy or equivalent instrument and to ensure that this strategy is mainstreamed into the planning and activities of all those sectors whose activities can have an impact positive and negative on biodiversity to date  2012-02-01 173 parties have developed nbsaps in line with article 6 4 for example the united kingdom new zealand and tanzania have carried out elaborate responses to conserve individual species and specific habitats the united states of america a signatory who has not yet ratified the treaty 5 has produced one of the most thorough implementation programs through species recovery programs and other mechanisms long in place in the usa for species conservation singapore has also established a detailed national biodiversity

recommendation of the cbd signatories during cop10 at nagoya in october 2010 criticismedit although the convention explicitly states that all forms of life are covered by its provisions 19 examination of reports and of national biodiversity strategies and action plans submitted by participating countries shows that in practice this is not happening the fifth report of the european union for example makes frequent reference to animals particularly fish and plants but does not mention bacteria fungi or protists at all 20 the international society for fungal conservation has assessed more than 100 of these cbd documents for their coverage of fungi using defined criteria to place each in one of six categories no documents were assessed as good or adequate less than 10 as nearly adequate or poor and the rest as deficient seriously deficient or totally deficient 21 see alsoedit 2010 biodiversity indicators partnership 2010 biodiversity target agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual
