heat in physics heat is energy that spontaneously passes between a system and its surroundings in some way other than through work or the transfer of matter when a suitable physical pathway exists heat flows spontaneously from a hotter to a colder body 1 2 3 4 5 6 the transfer can be by contact between the source and the destination body as in conduction or by radiation between remote bodies or by conduction and radiation through a thick solid wall or by way of an intermediate fluid body as in convective circulation or by a combination of these 7 8 9 because heat refers to a quantity of energy transferred between two bodies it is not a state function of either of the bodies in contrast to temperature and internal energy instead according to the first law of thermodynamics heat exchanged during some process contributes to the change in the internal energy and the amount of heat can be quantified by the equivalent amount of work that would bring about the same change while heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold it is possible to construct a heat pump or refrigeration system that does work to increase the difference in temperature between two systems conversely a heat engine reduces an existing temperature difference to do work on another system historically many energy units for measurement of heat have been used the standards-based unit in the international system of units si is the joule j heat is measured by its effect on the states of interacting bodies for example by the amount of ice melted or a change in temperature 10 the quantification of heat via the temperature change of a body is called calorimetry and is widely used in practice in calorimetry sensible heat is defined with respect to a specific chosen state variable of the system such as pressure or volume sensible heat causes a change of the temperature of the system while leaving the chosen state variable unchanged heat transfer that occurs at a constant system temperature but changes the state variable is called latent heat with respect to the variable for infinitesimal changes the total incremental heat transfer is then the sum of the latent and sensible heat  contents 1

further bibliography  historyedit physicist james clerk maxwell in his 1871 classic theory of heat was one of many who began to build on the already established idea that heat has something to do with matter in motion this was the same idea put forth by benjamin thompson in 1798 who said he was only following up on the work of many others one of maxwells recommended books was heat as a mode of motion by john tyndall maxwell outlined four stipulations for the definition of heat it is something which may be transferred from one body to another according to the second law of thermodynamics it is a measurable quantity and so can be treated mathematically it cannot be treated as a material substance because it may be transformed into something that is not a material substance eg mechanical work heat is one of the forms of energy 11 from empirically based ideas of heat and from other empirical observations the notions of internal energy and of entropy can be derived so as to lead to the recognition of the first and second laws of thermodynamics 12 this was the way of the historical pioneers of thermodynamics 13 14 transfers of energy as heat between two bodiesedit referring to conduction partington writes if a hot body is brought in conducting contact with a cold body the temperature of the hot body falls and that of the cold body rises and it is said that a quantity of heat has passed from the hot body to the cold body 15 referring to radiation maxwell writes in radiation the hotter body loses heat and the colder body receives heat by means of a process occurring in some intervening medium which does not itself thereby become hot 16 maxwell writes that convection as such is not a purely thermal phenomenon 17 in thermodynamics convection in general is regarded as transport of internal energy if however the convection is enclosed and circulatory then it may be regarded as an intermediary that transfers energy as heat between source and destination bodies because it transfers only energy and not matter from the source to the destination body 9 practical operating devices that harness transfers of energy as heatedit in accordance with the first law for closed systems energy transferred solely as heat leaves one body and enters another changing the internal energies of each transfer between bodies of energy as work is a complementary way of changing internal energies though it is not logically rigorous from the viewpoint of strict physical concepts a common form of words that expresses this is to say that heat and work are interconvertible cyclically operating engines that use only heat and work transfers have two thermal reservoirs a hot and a cold one they may be classified by the range of operating temperatures of the working body relative to those reservoirs in a heat engine the working body is at all times colder than the hot reservoir and hotter than the cold reservoir in a sense it uses heat transfer to produce work in a heat pump the working body at stages of the cycle goes both hotter than the hot reservoir and colder than the cold reservoir in a sense it uses work to produce heat transfer heat engineedit in classical thermodynamics a commonly considered model is the heat engine it consists of four bodies the working body the hot reservoir the cold reservoir and the work reservoir a cyclic process leaves the working body in an unchanged state and is envisaged as being repeated indefinitely often work transfers between the working body and the work reservoir are envisaged as reversible and thus only one work reservoir is needed but two thermal reservoirs are needed because transfer of energy as heat is irreversible a single cycle sees energy taken by the working body from the hot reservoir and sent to the two other reservoirs the work reservoir and the cold reservoir the hot reservoir always and only supplies energy and the cold reservoir always and only receives energy the second law of thermodynamics requires that no cycle can occur in which no energy is received by the cold reservoir heat engines achieve higher efficiency when the difference between initial and final temperature is greater heat pump or refrigeratoredit another commonly considered model is the heat pump or refrigerator again there are four bodies the working body the hot reservoir the cold reservoir and the work reservoir a single cycle starts with the working body colder than the cold reservoir and then energy is taken in as heat by the working body from the cold reservoir then the work reservoir does work on the working body adding more to its internal energy making it hotter than the hot reservoir the hot working body passes heat to the hot reservoir but still remains hotter than the cold reservoir then by allowing it to expand without doing work on another body and without passing heat to another body the working body is made colder than the cold reservoir it can now accept heat transfer from the cold reservoir to start another cycle the device has transported energy from a colder to a hotter reservoir but this is not regarded as being by an inanimate agency rather it is regarded as by the harnessing of work  this is because work is supplied from the work reservoir not just by a simple thermodynamic process but by a cycle of thermodynamic operations and processes which may be regarded as directed by an animate or harnessing agency accordingly the cycle is still in accord with the second law of thermodynamics the efficiency of a heat pump is best when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is least functionally such engines are used in two ways distinguishing a target reservoir and a resource or surrounding reservoir a heat pump transfers heat to the hot reservoir as the target from the resource or surrounding reservoir a refrigerator transfers heat from the cold reservoir as the target to the resource or surrounding reservoir the target reservoir may be regarded as leaking when the target leaks hotness to the surroundings heat pumping is used when the target leaks coldness to the surroundings refrigeration is used the engines harness work to overcome the leaks macroscopic view of quantity of energy transferred as heatedit according to planck there are three main conceptual approaches to heat 18 one is the microscopic or kinetic theory approach the other two are macroscopic approaches one is the approach through the law of conservation of energy taken as prior to thermodynamics with a mechanical analysis of processes for example in the work of helmholtz this mechanical view is taken in this article as currently customary for thermodynamic theory the other macroscopic approach is the thermodynamic one which admits heat as a primitive concept which contributes by scientific induction 19 to knowledge of the law of conservation of energy this view is widely taken as the practical one quantity of heat being measured by calorimetry bailyn also distinguishes the two macroscopic approaches as the mechanical and the thermodynamic 20 the thermodynamic view was taken by the founders of thermodynamics in the nineteenth century it regards quantity of energy transferred as heat as a primitive concept coherent with a primitive concept of temperature measured primarily by calorimetry a calorimeter is a body in the surroundings of the system with its own temperature and internal energy when it is connected to the system by a path for heat transfer changes in it measure heat transfer the mechanical view was pioneered by helmholtz and developed and used in the twentieth century largely through the influence of max born 21 it regards quantity of heat transferred as heat as a derived concept defined for closed systems as quantity of heat transferred by mechanisms other than work transfer the latter being regarded as primitive for thermodynamics defined by macroscopic mechanics according to born the transfer of internal energy between open systems that accompanies transfer of matter cannot be reduced to mechanics 22 it follows that there is no well-founded definition of quantities of energy transferred as heat or as work associated with transfer of matter nevertheless for the thermodynamical description of non-equilibrium processes it is desired to consider the effect of a temperature gradient established by the surroundings across the system of interest when there is no physical barrier or wall between system and surroundings that is to say when they are open with respect to one another the impossibility of a mechanical definition in terms of work for this circumstance does not alter the physical fact that a temperature gradient causes a diffusive flux of internal energy a process that in the thermodynamic view might be proposed as a candidate concept for transfer of energy as heat in this circumstance it may be expected that there may also be active other drivers of diffusive flux of internal energy such as gradient of chemical potential which drives transfer of matter and gradient of electric potential which drives electric current and iontophoresis such effects usually interact with diffusive flux of internal energy driven by temperature gradient and such interactions are known as cross-effects 23 if cross-effects that result in diffusive transfer of internal energy were also labeled as heat transfers they would sometimes violate the rule that pure heat transfer occurs only down a temperature gradient never up one they would also contradict the principle that all heat transfer is of one and the same kind a principle founded on the idea of heat conduction between closed systems one might to try to think narrowly of heat flux driven purely by temperature gradient as a conceptual component of diffusive internal energy flux in the thermodynamic view the concept resting specifically on careful calculations based on detailed knowledge of the processes and being indirectly assessed in these circumstances if perchance it happens that no transfer of matter is actualized and there are no cross-effects then the thermodynamic concept and the mechanical concept coincide as if one were dealing with closed systems but when there is transfer of matter the exact laws by which temperature gradient drives diffusive flux of internal energy rather than being exactly knowable mostly need to be assumed and in many cases are practically unverifiable consequently when there is transfer of matter the calculation of the pure heat flux component of the diffusive flux of internal energy rests on practically unverifiable assumptions 24quotations 1 25 this is a reason to think of heat as a specialized concept that relates primarily and precisely to closed systems and applicable only in a very restricted way to open systems in many writings in this context the term heat flux is used when what is meant is therefore more accurately called diffusive flux of internal energy such usage of the term heat flux is a residue of older and now obsolete language usage that allowed that a body may have a heat content 26 microscopic view of heatedit in the kinetic theory heat is explained in terms of the microscopic motions and interactions of constituent particles such as electrons atoms and molecules 27 the immediate meaning of the kinetic energy of the constituent particles is not as heat it is as a component of internal energy in microscopic terms heat is a transfer quantity and is described by a transport theory not as steadily localized kinetic energy of particles heat transfer arises from temperature gradients or differences through the diffuse exchange of microscopic kinetic and potential particle energy by particle collisions and other interactions an early and vague expression of this was made by francis bacon 28 29 precise and detailed versions of it were developed in the nineteenth century 30 in statistical mechanics for a closed system no transfer of matter heat is the energy transfer associated with a disordered microscopic action on the system associated with jumps in occupation numbers of the energy levels of the system without change in the values of the energy levels themselves 31 it is possible for macroscopic thermodynamic work to alter the occupation numbers without change in the values of the system energy levels themselves but what distinguishes transfer as heat is that the transfer is entirely due to disordered microscopic action including radiative transfer a mathematical definition can be formulated for small increments of quasi-static adiabatic work in terms of the statistical distribution of an ensemble of microstates notation and unitsedit as a form of energy heat has the unit joule j in the international system of units si however in many applied fields in engineering the british thermal unit btu and the calorie are often used the standard unit for the rate of heat transferred is the watt w defined as joules per second the total amount of energy transferred as heat is conventionally written as q from quantity for algebraic purposes 32 heat released by a system into its surroundings is by convention a negative quantity q 0 when a system absorbs heat from its surroundings it is positive q 0 heat transfer rate or heat flow per unit time is denoted by q  displaystyle dot q  this should not be confused with a time derivative of a function of state which can also be written with the dot notation since heat is not a function of state 33 heat flux is defined as rate of heat transfer per unit cross-sectional area resulting in the unit watts per square metre estimation of quantity of heatedit quantity of heat transferred can measured by calorimetry or determined through calculations based on other quantities calorimetry is the empirical basis of the idea of quantity of heat transferred in a process the transferred heat is measured by changes in a body of known properties for example temperature rise change in volume or length or phase change such as melting of ice 34 35 a calculation of quantity of heat transferred can rely on a hypothetical quantity of energy transferred as adiabatic work and on the first law of thermodynamics such calculation is the primary approach of many theoretical studies of quantity of heat transferred 36 37 38 internal energy and enthalpyedit for a closed system a system from which no matter can enter or exit one version of the first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy δu of the system is equal to the amount of heat q supplied to the system minus the amount of work w done by system on its surroundings the foregoing sign convention for work is used in the present article but an alternate sign convention followed by iupac for work is to consider the work performed on the system by its surroundings as positive this is the convention adopted by many modern textbooks of physical chemistry such as those by peter atkins and ira levine but many textbooks on physics define work as work done by the system this formula can be re-written so as to express a definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat based purely on the concept of adiabatic work if it is supposed that δu is defined and measured solely by processes of adiabatic work the work done by the system includes boundary work when the system increases its volume against an external force such as that exerted by a piston and other work eg shaft work performed by a compressor fan which is called isochoric work in this section we will neglect the other- or isochoric work contribution the internal energy u is a state function in cyclical processes such as the operation of a heat engine state functions of the working substance return to their initial values upon completion of a cycle the differential or infinitesimal increment for the internal energy in an infinitesimal process is an exact differential du the symbol for exact differentials is the lowercase letter d in contrast neither of the infinitesimal increments δq nor δw in an infinitesimal process represents the state of the system thus infinitesimal increments of heat and work are inexact differentials the lowercase greek letter delta δ is the symbol for inexact differentials the integral of any inexact differential over the time it takes for a system to leave and return to the same thermodynamic state does not necessarily equal zero as recounted below in the section headed entropy the second law of thermodynamics observes that if heat is supplied to a system in which no irreversible processes take place and which has a well-defined temperature t the increment of heat δq and the temperature t form the exact differential and that s the entropy of the working body is a function of state likewise with a well-defined pressure p behind the moving boundary the work differential δw and the pressure p combine to form the exact differential with v the volume of the system which is a state variable in general for homogeneous systems associated with this differential equation is that the internal energy may be considered to be a function u sv of its natural variables s and v the internal energy representation of the fundamental thermodynamic relation is written if v is constant and if p is constant with h the enthalpy defined by the enthalpy may be considered to be a function h sp of its natural variables s and p the enthalpy representation of the fundamental thermodynamic relation is written the internal energy representation and the enthalpy representation are partial legendre transforms of one another they contain the same physical information written in different ways like the internal energy the enthalpy stated as a function of its natural variables is a thermodynamic potential and contains all thermodynamic information about a body 41 42 heat added to a body at constant pressureedit if a quantity q of heat is added to a body while it does expansion work w on its surroundings one has if this is constrained to happen at constant pressure with δp  0 the expansion work w done by the body is given by w  p δv recalling the first law of thermodynamics one has consequently by substitution one has in this scenario the increase in enthalpy is equal to the quantity of heat added to the system since many processes do take place at constant pressure or approximately at atmospheric pressure the enthalpy is therefore sometimes given the misleading name of heat content 43 it is sometimes also called the heat function 44 in terms of the natural variables s and p of the state function h this process of change of state from state 1 to state 2 can be expressed as it is known that the temperature ts p is identically stated by consequently in this case the integral specifies a quantity of heat transferred at constant pressure entropyedit in 1856 german physicist rudolf clausius referring to closed systems in which transfers of matter do not occur defined the second fundamental theorem the second law of thermodynamics in the mechanical theory of heat thermodynamics if two transformations which without necessitating any other permanent change can mutually replace one another be called equivalent then the generations of the quantity of heat q from work at the temperature t has the equivalence-value 45 46 in 1865 he came to define the entropy symbolized by s such that due to the supply of the amount of heat q at temperature t the entropy of the system is increased by in a transfer of energy as heat without work being done there are changes of entropy in both the surroundings which lose heat and the system which gains it the increase δs of entropy in the system may be considered to consist of two parts an increment δs that matches or compensates the change δs of entropy in the surroundings and a further increment δs that may be considered to be generated or produced in the system and is said therefore to be uncompensated thus this may also be written the total change of entropy in the system and surroundings is thus this may also be written it is then said that an amount of entropy δs has been transferred from the surroundings to the system because entropy is not a conserved quantity this is an exception to the general way of speaking in which an amount transferred is of a conserved quantity the second law of thermodynamics observes that in a natural transfer of energy as heat in which the temperature of the system is different from that of the surroundings it is always so that for purposes of mathematical analysis of transfers one thinks of fictive processes that are called reversible with the temperature t of the system being hardly less than that of the surroundings and the transfer taking place at an imperceptibly slow speed following the definition above in formula  1 for such a fictive reversible process a quantity of transferred heat δq an inexact differential is analyzed as a quantity t ds with ds an exact differential this equality is only valid for a fictive transfer in which there is no production of entropy that is to say in which there is no uncompensated entropy if in contrast the process is natural and can really occur with irreversibility then there is entropy production with dsuncompensated  0 the quantity t dsuncompensated was termed by clausius the uncompensated heat though that does not accord with present-day terminology then one has this leads to the statement which is the second law of thermodynamics for closed systems in non-equilibrium thermodynamics that approximates by assuming the hypothesis of local thermodynamic equilibrium there is a special notation for this the transfer of energy as heat is assumed to take place across an infinitesimal temperature difference so that the system element and its surroundings have near enough the same temperature t then one writes where by definition the second law for a natural process asserts that latent and sensible heatedit in an 1847 lecture entitled on matter living force and heat james prescott joule characterized the terms latent heat and sensible heat as components of heat each affecting distinct physical phenomena namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles respectively 51quotations 2 he described latent energy as the energy possessed via a distancing of particles where attraction was over a greater distance ie a form of potential energy and the sensible heat as an energy involving the motion of particles or what was known as a living force at the time of joule kinetic energy either held invisibly internally or held visibly externally was known as a living force latent heat is the heat released or absorbed by a chemical substance or a thermodynamic system during a change of state that occurs without a change in temperature such a process may be a phase transition such as the melting of ice or the boiling of water 52 53 the term was introduced around 1750 by joseph black as derived from the latin latere to lie hidden characterizing its effect as not being directly measurable with a thermometer sensible heat in contrast to latent heat is the heat transferred to a thermodynamic system that has as its sole effect a change of temperature 54 both latent heat and sensible heat transfers increase the internal energy of the system to which they are transferred consequences of blacks distinction between sensible and latent heat are examined in the wikipedia article on calorimetry specific heatedit specific heat also called specific heat capacity is defined as the amount of energy that has to be transferred to or from one unit of mass kilogram or amount of substance mole to change the system temperature by one degree specific heat is a physical property which means that it depends on the substance under consideration and its state as specified by its properties the specific heats of monatomic gases eg helium are nearly constant with temperature diatomic gases such as hydrogen display some temperature dependence and triatomic gases eg carbon dioxide still more relation between heat and temperatureedit before the discovery of the laws of thermodynamics quantity of energy transferred as heat was measured by changes in the states of the participating bodies some general rules with important exceptions that will be indicated noted in following paragraphs of this section can be stated as follows most bodies over most temperature ranges expand on being heated mostly heating a body at a constant volume increases the pressure it exerts on its constraining walls and increases its temperature also mostly heating a body at a constant pressure increases its volume and increases its temperature beyond this most substances have three ordinarily recognized states of matter solid liquid and gas and a fourth less obviously recognized one plasma many have further more finely differentiated states of matter such as for example glass and liquid crystal in many cases at fixed temperature and pressure a substance can exist in several distinct states of matter in what might be viewed as the same body for example ice may float in a glass of water then the ice and the water are said to constitute two phases within the body definite rules are known telling how distinct phases may coexist in a body mostly at a fixed pressure there is a definite temperature at which heating causes a solid to melt or evaporate and a definite temperature at which heating causes a liquid to evaporate in such cases cooling has the reverse effects all of these the commonest cases fit with a rule that heating can be measured by changes of state of a body such cases supply what are called thermometric bodies that allow the definition of empirical temperatures before 1848 all temperatures were defined in this way there was thus a tight link apparently logically determined between heat and temperature though they were recognized as conceptually thoroughly distinct especially by joseph black in the later eighteenth century there are important exceptions they break the obviously apparent link between heat and temperature they make it clear that empirical definitions of temperature are contingent on the peculiar properties of particular thermometric substances and are thus precluded from the title absolute for example water contracts on being heated near 277k it cannot be used as a thermometric substance near that temperature also over a certain temperature range ice contracts on heating moreover many substances can exist in metastable states such as with negative pressure that survive only transiently and in very special conditions such facts sometimes called anomalous are some of the reasons for the thermodynamic definition of absolute temperature in the early days of measurement of high temperatures another factor was important and used by josiah wedgwood in his pyrometer the temperature reached in a process was estimated by the shrinkage of a sample of clay the higher the temperature the more the shrinkage this was the only available more or less reliable method of measurement of temperatures above 1000c but such shrinkage is irreversible the clay does not expand again on cooling that is why it could be used for the measurement but only once it is not a thermometric material in the usual sense of the word nevertheless the thermodynamic definition of absolute temperature does make essential use of the concept of heat with proper circumspection relation between hotness and temperatureedit according to denbigh the property of hotness is a concern of thermodynamics that should be defined without reference to the concept of heat consideration of hotness leads to the concept of empirical temperature 55 all physical systems are capable of heating or cooling others 56 this does not require that they have thermodynamic temperatures with reference to hotness the comparative terms hotter and colder are defined by the rule that heat flows from the hotter body to the colder 57 58 59 if a physical system is inhomogeneous or very rapidly or irregularly changing for example by turbulence it may be impossible to characterize it by a temperature but still there can be transfer of energy as heat between it and another system if a system has a physical state that is regular enough and persists long enough to allow it to reach thermal equilibrium with a specified thermometer then it has a temperature according to that thermometer an empirical thermometer registers degree of hotness for such a system such a temperature is called empirical 60 61 62 for example truesdell writes about classical thermodynamics at each time the body is assigned a real number called the temperature this number is a measure of how hot the body is 63 physical systems that are too turbulent to have temperatures may still differ in hotness a physical system that passes heat to another physical system is said to be the hotter of the two more is required for the system to have a thermodynamic temperature its behavior must be so regular that its empirical temperature is the same for all suitably calibrated and scaled thermometers and then its hotness is said to lie on the one-dimensional hotness manifold this is part of the reason why heat is defined following carathéodory and born solely as occurring other than by work or transfer of matter temperature is advisedly and deliberately not mentioned in this now widely accepted definition this is also the reason why the zeroth law of thermodynamics is stated explicitly if three physical systems a b and c are each not in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium it is possible that with suitable physical connections being made between them a can heat b and b can heat c and c can heat a in non-equilibrium situations cycles of flow are possible it is the special and uniquely distinguishing characteristic of internal thermodynamic equilibrium that this possibility is not open to thermodynamic systems as distinguished amongst physical systems which are in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium this is the reason why the zeroth law of thermodynamics needs explicit statement that is to say the relation is not colder than between general non-equilibrium physical systems is not transitive whereas in contrast the relation has no lower a temperature than between thermodynamic systems in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium is transitive it follows from this that the relation is in thermal equilibrium with is transitive which is one way of stating the zeroth law just as temperature may undefined for a sufficiently inhomogeneous system so also may entropy be undefined for a system not in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium for example the temperature of the solar system is not a defined quantity likewise the entropy of the solar system is not defined in classical thermodynamics it has not been possible to define non-equilibrium entropy as a simple number for a whole system in a clearly satisfactory way 64 rigorous definition of quantity of energy transferred as heatedit it is sometimes convenient to have a rigorous definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat such a definition is customarily based on the work of carathéodory  1909 referring to processes in a closed system as follows 36 65 66 67 68 69 the internal energy ux of a body in an arbitrary state x can be determined by amounts of work adiabatically performed by the body on its surrounds when it starts from a reference state o such work is assessed through quantities defined in the surroundings of the body it is supposed that such work can be assessed accurately without error due to friction in the surroundings friction in the body is not excluded by this definition the adiabatic performance of work is defined in terms of adiabatic walls which allow transfer of energy as work but no other transfer of energy or matter in particular they do not allow the passage of energy as heat according to this definition work performed adiabatically is in general accompanied by friction within the thermodynamic system or body on the other hand according to carathéodory  1909 there also exist non-adiabatic walls which are postulated to be permeable only to heat and are called diathermal for the definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat it is customarily envisaged that an arbitrary state of interest y is reached from state o by a process with two components one adiabatic and the other not adiabatic for convenience one may say that the adiabatic component was the sum of work done by the body through volume change through movement of the walls while the non-adiabatic wall was temporarily rendered adiabatic and of isochoric adiabatic work then the non-adiabatic component is a process of energy transfer through the wall that passes only heat newly made accessible for the purpose of this transfer from the surroundings to the body the change in internal energy to reach the state y from the state o is the difference of the two amounts of energy transferred although carathéodory himself did not state such a definition following his work it is customary in theoretical studies to define the quantity of energy transferred as heat q to the body from its surroundings in the combined process of change to state y from the state o as the change in internal energy δuy minus the amount of work w done by the body on its surrounds by the adiabatic process so that q  δuy  w in this definition for the sake of conceptual rigour the quantity of energy transferred as heat is not specified directly in terms of the non-adiabatic process it is defined through knowledge of precisely two variables the change of internal energy and the amount of adiabatic work done for the combined process of change from the reference state o to the arbitrary state y it is important that this does not explicitly involve the amount of energy transferred in the non-adiabatic component of the combined process it is assumed here that the amount of energy required to pass from state o to state y the change of internal energy is known independently of the combined process by a determination through a purely adiabatic process like that for the determination of the internal energy of state x above the rigour that is prized in this definition is that there is one and only one kind of energy transfer admitted as fundamental energy transferred as work energy transfer as heat is considered as a derived quantity the uniqueness of work in this scheme is considered to guarantee rigor and purity of conception the conceptual purity of this definition based on the concept of energy transferred as work as an ideal notion relies on the idea that some frictionless and otherwise non-dissipative processes of energy transfer can be realized in physical actuality the second law of thermodynamics on the other hand assures us that such processes are not found in nature heat temperature and thermal equilibrium regarded as jointly primitive notionsedit before the rigorous mathematical definition of heat based on carathéodorys 1909 paper recounted just above historically heat temperature and thermal equilibrium were presented in thermodynamics textbooks as jointly primitive notions 70 carathéodory introduced his 1909 paper thus the proposition that the discipline of thermodynamics can be justified without recourse to any hypothesis that cannot be verified experimentally must be regarded as one of the most noteworthy results of the research in thermodynamics that was accomplished during the last century referring to the point of view adopted by most authors who were active in the last fifty years carathéodory wrote there exists a physical quantity called heat that is not identical with the mechanical quantities mass force pressure etc and whose variations can be determined by calorimetric measurements james serrin introduces an account of the theory of thermodynamics thus in the following section we shall use the classical notions of heat work and hotness as primitive elements  that heat is an appropriate and natural primitive for thermodynamics was already accepted by carnot its continued validity as a primitive element of thermodynamical structure is due to the fact that it synthesizes an essential physical concept as well as to its successful use in recent work to unify different constitutive theories 71 72 this traditional kind of presentation of the basis of thermodynamics includes ideas that may be summarized by the statement that heat transfer is purely due to spatial non-uniformity of temperature and is by conduction and radiation from hotter to colder bodies it is sometimes proposed that this traditional kind of presentation necessarily rests on circular reasoning against this proposal there stands the rigorously logical mathematical development of the theory presented by truesdell and bharatha  1977 73 this alternative approach to the definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat differs in logical structure from that of carathéodory recounted just above this alternative approach admits calorimetry as a primary or direct way to measure quantity of energy transferred as heat it relies on temperature as one of its primitive concepts and used in calorimetry 74 it is presupposed that enough processes exist physically to allow measurement of differences in internal energies such processes are not restricted to adiabatic transfers of energy as work they include calorimetry which is the commonest practical way of finding internal energy differences 75 the needed temperature can be either empirical or absolute thermodynamic in contrast the carathéodory way recounted just above does not use calorimetry or temperature in its primary definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat the carathéodory way regards calorimetry only as a secondary or indirect way of measuring quantity of energy transferred as heat as recounted in more detail just above the carathéodory way regards quantity of energy transferred as heat in a process as primarily or directly defined as a residual quantity it is calculated from the difference of the internal energies of the initial and final states of the system and from the actual work done by the system during the process that internal energy difference is supposed to have been measured in advance through processes of purely adiabatic transfer of energy as work processes that take the system between the initial and final states by the carathéodory way it is presupposed as known from experiment that there actually physically exist enough such adiabatic processes so that there need be no recourse to calorimetry for measurement of quantity of energy transferred as heat this presupposition is essential but is explicitly labeled neither as a law of thermodynamics nor as an axiom of the carathéodory way in fact the actual physical existence of such adiabatic processes is indeed mostly supposition and those supposed processes have in most cases not been actually verified empirically to exist 76 heat transfer in engineeringedit the discipline of heat transfer typically considered an aspect of mechanical engineering and chemical engineering deals with specific applied methods by which thermal energy in a system is generated or converted or transferred to another system although the definition of heat implicitly means the transfer of energy the term heat transfer encompasses this traditional usage in many engineering disciplines and laymen language heat transfer includes the mechanisms of heat conduction thermal radiation and mass transfer in engineering the term convective heat transfer is used to describe the combined effects of conduction and fluid flow from the thermodynamic point of view heat flows into a fluid by diffusion to increase its energy the fluid then transfers advects this increased internal energy not heat from one location to another and this is then followed by a second thermal interaction which transfers heat to a second body or system again by diffusion this entire process is often regarded as an additional mechanism of heat transfer although technically heat transfer and thus heating and cooling occurs only on either end of such a conductive flow but not as a result of flow thus conduction can be said to transfer heat only as a net result of the process but may not do so at every time within the complicated convective process although distinct physical laws may describe the behavior of each of these methods real systems often exhibit a complicated combination which are often described by a variety of mathematical methodsfurther explanation needed see alsoedit energy portal effect of sun angle on climate heat death of the universe heat diffusion heat equation heat exchanger heat wave heat flux sensor heat
