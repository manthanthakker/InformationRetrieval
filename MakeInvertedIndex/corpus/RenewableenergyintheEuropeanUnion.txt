protecting the environment the amsterdam treaty added the principle of sustainable development to the objectives of the eu since 1997 the eu has been working towards a renewable energy supply equivalent to 12 of the total eus energy consumption by 2010 the johannesburg summit failed to introduce the radical changes targeted for ten years after the rio summit no specific goals were set for the energy sector which disappointed many countries while the eu had proposed an annual increase in the use of renewable energy at a rate of 1.5 worldwide until 2010 johannesburgs action plan did not recommend such a substantial increase with no concrete goals nor dates being set the eu was unwilling to accept this result and with other nations formed a group of pioneer countries that promised to establish ambitious national or even regional goals to achieve global targets the johannesburg renewable energy coalition jrec has a total of more than 80 member countries the eu members brazil south africa and new zealand amongst them in the european conference for renewable energy in berlin in 2004 the eu defined ambitious goals of its own the conclusion was that by 2020 the eu would seek to obtain 20 of its total energy consumption requirements with renewable energy sources up until that point the eu had only set targets up to 2010 and this proposal was the first to represent the eus commitment up to 2020 renewable energy targetsedit in 2009 the renewables directive set binding targets for all eu member states such that the eu will reach a 20 share of energy from renewable sources by 2020 and a 10 share of renewable energy specifically in the transport sector by 2014 the eu realized a 16 share of energy from renewable sources with nine member states already achieving its goals in 2014 negotiations about eu energy and climate targets until 2030 are set to start central and eastern european member states are likely to attempt to slow down the transformation process 3 4 the key parts of the european renewable energy targets agreement set in 2014 are as proposed by a shell lobbyist in october 2011 shell is the sixth biggest lobbyist in brussels spending between €4.25-4.5m a year lobbying the eu institutions agreement has no binding targets for member states on energy efficiency or renewable energy 5 links to climate policyedit underlying many of the eus energy policy proposals is the goal to limit global temperature changes to no more than 2c above pre-industrial levels 6 of which 0.8c has already taken place and another 0.5–0.7c for total warming of 1.3-1.5c is already committed 7 2c is usually seen as the upper temperature limit to avoid dangerous global warming 8 however some scientists such as kevin anderson 3 professor of energy and climate change in the school of mechanical aeronautical and civil engineering at the university of manchester and former director of the tyndall centre the uks leading academic climate change research organisation have argued that to be consistent with the science 1c is a more accurate threshold for dangerous climate change 9 10 actionsedit eu energy efficiency and renewable energy actions includes build up the covenant of mayors sustainable energy europe campaign concerto managenergy intelligent energy  europe iee u4energy is an initiative funded under the iee programme to improve energy consumption in schools and their local communities eco-innovation member statesedit article 4 of the renewables directive required member states to submit national renewable energy action plans by 30 june 2010 these plans to be prepared in accordance with the template published by the commission provide detailed roadmaps of how each member state expects to reach its legally binding 2020 target for the share of renewable energy in their final energy consumption member states must set out the sectoral targets the technology mix they expect to use the trajectory they will follow and the measures and reforms they will undertake to overcome the barriers to developing renewable energy the plans are published by the ec upon receipt in the original language allowing public scrutiny the commission will evaluate them assessing their completeness and credibility in parallel the plans will be translated into english in addition the energy research centre of the netherlands was contracted by the european environment agency to create an external database and quantitative report of the reports received so far the member states which joined the eu in 2004 must apply the provisions of directive 2001/77ec on producing electricity from renewable energy sources their accession treaty sets national indicative targets for the proportion of electricity produced from res res-e in each new member state the result of which is an overall objective of 21 for the eu-25 the member states must adopt and publish initially every five years a report setting the indicative member state targets for future res-e consumption for the following ten years and showing what measures have or are to be taken to meet those targets the member state targets must take account of the reference values set out in the annex to the directive for member states indicative targets concerning the share of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in gross electricity consumption in 2010 they must also be compatible with all the national commitments entered into as part of the commitments accepted by the community in kyoto germanyedit  nuclear 91.8 twh  17.2  brown coal 140.7 twh  26.4  hard coal 110.1

in 2005 12 solar energy production accounted for almost 9 of the total electric consumption in the country in 2014 making italy the country with the highest contribution from solar energy in the world 12 lithuaniaedit the majority of renewable energy in lithuania is from firewood the principal source of electricity from renewable resources is from hydropower 13 lithuania has many yet undeveloped renewable energy sources such as wind solar geothermal energy municipal waste and biomass the amount of biomass per capita in lithuania is one of the highest in the european union and it is estimated that in 2020 lithuania will be the first in the eu according to the quantity of available biomass for biofuel production the projected production of biofuels by 2020 is 0.25 tons per capita 14 portugaledit in 2010 more than 50 of all yearly electricity consumption in portugal was generated from renewable energy sources 15 the most important generation sources were hydroelectric  30 and wind power  18 with bioenergy  5 and photovoltaic solar power  0,5 accounting for the rest in 2001 the portuguese government launched a new energy policy instrument  the e4 programme energy efficiency and endogenous energies consisting of a set of multiple diversified measures aimed at promoting a consistent integrated approach to energy supply and demand by promoting energy efficiency and the use of endogenous renewable energy sources the programme seeks to upgrade the competitiveness of the portuguese economy and to modernize the countrys social fabric while simultaneously preserving the environment by reducing gas emissions especially the co2 responsible for climatic change as a result in the five years between 2005 and 2010 energy production from renewable sources increased 28 16 in january 2014 91 of the monthly needed portuguese electricity consumption was generated by renewable sources 17 18 although the real figure stands at 78 as 14 was exported  portugal has the second largest photovoltaic power station in the world 19 which was completed in december 2008 the complex called amareleja photovoltaic power station covers an area of 250-hectare the 46-megawatt solar power plant produces enough electricity for 30,000 homes and saves more than 89,383 tons a year in greenhouse gas emissions also in production since january 2007 the serpa solar power plant with an installed capacity 11mw covers an area of 60-hectare produces enough energy for 8,000 homes and saves more than 30,000 tons a year in greenhouse gas emissions these solar parks are approximately 30km apart spainedit spain as a whole has the target of generating 30 of its electricity needs from renewable energy sources by 2010 with half of that amount coming from wind power in 2006 20 of the total electricity demand was already produced with renewable energy sources and in january 2009 the total electricity demand produced with renewable energy sources reached 34.8 20 some regions of spain lead europe in the use of renewable energy technology and plan to reach 100 renewable energy generation in few years castilla y león and galicia in particular are near this goal in 2006 they fulfilled about 70 of their total electricity demand from renewable energy sources if nuclear power is also considered co2 free two autonomous communities in spain have already managed to fulfill their total 2006 electricity demand free of co2 emissions extremadura and castilla-la mancha 21 in 2005 spain became the first country in the world to require the installation of photovoltaic electricity generation in new buildings and the second in the world after israel to require the installation of solar hot water systems 22 united kingdomedit by 2004 4.65 of the uks electricity requirements were being generated from renewable energy sources including hydroelectricity up from 2.55 in 1990 this figure rose to 8.7 by 2011 the total contribution of renewable energy to all energy consumption in the uk was 3.8 in 2011 this comprised 8.7 of electricity 2.2 of heat and 2.9 of transport fuel coming from renewable sources uk government energy policy set a target for renewable electricity to provide 10 of all electricity use by 2010 this target was not met the uk has agreed to the eu wide renewable energy target of 20 of all energy to come from renewables by 2020 in line with the eu 2009 renewable energy directive the uks specific target is to achieve 15 of all energy from renewables the uks department of energy and climate change decc has announced that the uk will attempt to meet this target with 30 renewable electricity 12 renewable heat and 10 renewable transport fuel as of 2010updateneeds update the uk was 25th of the 27 eu member states in terms of the fraction of energy produced from renewables the prospects for renewable energy in scotland in particular are significant scotland has an estimated potential of 36.5 gw of installed capacity from wind and 7.5 gw from tidal power 25 of the estimated total capacity for the european union for both and up to 14 gw of wave power potential 10 of eu capacity 23 24 the scottish government has a target of generating 50 of scotlands gross annual consumption of electricity from renewables by 2015 rising to 100 by 2020 25 energy community countriesedit also the contracting parties of the energy community albania bosnia and herzegovina kosovo macedonia moldova montenegro serbia and ukraine implement the directive 2009/28ec since september 2012 the shares for the contracting parties were calculated based on the eu methodology and reflect an equal level of ambition as the targets fixed for eu member states the targets for the share of renewable energy in contracting parties in 2020 are the following albania 38 bosnia and herzegovina 40 kosovo 25 macedonia 28 moldova 17 montenegro 33 serbia 27 and ukraine 11 the deadline for transposing the directive 2009/28ec and the adoption of the national renewable energy action plan nreap was set for 1 january 2014 with the decision 2012/03mc-enc and the acceptance of binding targets contracting parties can participate in all cooperation mechanisms this means in particular that statistical transfers of renewable energy for the purposes of target achievement will be possible independently from physical flow of electricity in addition the decision lays down a number of adaptations to the rules for statistical transfers and joint support schemes between the contracting parties and eu member states to ensure the original objectives of the res directive are preserved renewable energy sourcesedit bioenergyedit 2009 by the middle of the year britains first major bioethanol plant should be completed and should use more than one million tonnes of wheat per year the plant in wilton northeast england will be europes largest biorefinery producing around 400million to 450million litres of bioethanol a year as well as 350,000 tonnes of animal feed currently the largest plant in the uk is a british sugar facility in eastern england with an annual production capacity of about 70million litres 26 geothermaledit european geothermal energy council egec promotes geothermal energy in the european union geoener is the building and industrial geothermal energy congress 27 wind poweredit description wind turbines are used to generated electricity research from a wide variety of sources in various european countries shows that support for wind power is consistently about 80 per cent amongst the general public 28 2011 installed wind power capacity in the european union totalled 93,957 megawatts mw - enough to supply 6.3 of the eus electricity 9,616 mw of wind power was installed in 2011 alone representing 21.4 of new power capacity the eu wind industry has had an average annual growth of 15.6 over the last 17 years  1995-2011 29 2009 a european environment agency report entitled europes onshore and offshore wind energy potential confirms wind energy could power europe many times over 30 the report highlights wind powers potential in 2020 as three times greater than europes expected electricity demand rising to a factor of seven by 2030 31 an ewea report overviewing 2009 data estimated that 230 gigawatts gw of wind capacity will be installed in europe by 2020 consisting of 190 gw onshore and 40 gw offshore this would produce 14-17 of the eus electricity avoiding 333 million tonnes of co2 per year and saving europe €28 billion a year in avoided fuel costs 32 solar energyedit photovoltaic solar poweredit description pv solar power are solar modules that are used to generate electricity 2012 17.2 gw of pv capacity were connected to the grid in europe  compared to 22.4 gw in 2011 europe still accounted for the predominant share of the global pv market with 55 of all new capacity in 2012 33 2004 79 of all european capacity was in germany where 794 mwp had been installed the european commission anticipated that germany may have installed around 4,500 mwp by 2010 34 2002 the world production of photovoltaic modules surpassed 550 mw of which more than the 50 was produced in the eu within 15 years even a small country in europe might expect to exceed this amount in domestic installations concentrated solar poweredit description csv power can generate either heat or electrictiy according to the type used one advantage of concentrated solar power csp is the ability to include thermal energy storage to provide power up to 24 hours a day 35 2015 the first commercial application of a a new form of csp called stem will take place in sicily  36 this has generated considerable academic and commercial interest internationally for off-grid applications to produce 24 hour industrial scale power for mining sites and remote communities in italy other parts of europe australia asia north africa and latin america stem uses fluidized silica sand as a thermal storage and heat transfer medium for csp systems it has been developed by salerno-based magaldi industries 2012 by year end in the european union 2,114 mwp had been installed mainly in spain gemasolar in spain was the first to provide 24hour power 37 solar heating and coolingedit description solar heating is the usage of solar energy to provide space or water heating 2016 at present the eu is second after china in the installations 2010 if all eu countries used solar thermal as enthusiastically as the austrians the eus installed capacity would already be 91 gwth  130million m2 today far beyond the target of 100million m2 by 2010 set by the white paper in 1997 2008 the research efforts and infrastructure needed to supply 50 of the energy for space and water heating and cooling across europe using solar thermal energy was set out under the aegis of the european solar thermal technology platform esttp 38 published in late december 2008 more than 100 experts developed the strategic research agenda sra 39 which includes a deployment roadmap showing the non-technological framework conditions that will enable this ambitious goal to be reached by 2050 40 2007 estifs minimum target is to produce solar heating equivalent to
