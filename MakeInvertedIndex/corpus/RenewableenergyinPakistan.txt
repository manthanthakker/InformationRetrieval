renewable energy in pakistan renewable energy in pakistan is a relatively underdeveloped sector however in recent years there has been some interest by environmentalist groups and from the authorities to explore renewable energy resources for energy production in light of the energy crises and power shortages affecting the country most of the renewable energy in pakistan comes from hydroelectricity  contents 1 solar power 2 wind power 3 tidal power 4 references 5 external links  solar poweredit there have been some efforts to install and expand the use of solar energy in pakistan the average amount of daily sunlight in pakistan is nine and a half hourscitation needed there are a few cloudy days even in the wettest regions eight power generation plants have been installed and eleven are in various stages of completionwhen further feasibility studies are undergoing in december 1981 the first solar photovoltaic system was commissioned located in mumniala a village 60km from islamabad four solar systems has been commissioned in khukhera lasbela district ghakar attock district malmari thatta district now that system is unserviceable and dittal khan leghari digri mirpurkhas districtthe punjab government announced the establishment of quaid-e-azam solar park over an area of 5,000 acres in the cholistan development authority in bahawalpur 1 a practical example of the use of solar energy can be seen in some rural villages of pakistan where houses have been provided with solar panels that run electric fans and energy-saving bulbs one notable and successfully implemented case was the village of narian khorian about 50 kilometers from islamabad which employs the use of 100 solar panels installed by a local firm free of cost these panels have provide energy through lights and fan facilities to some 100 households 2 the alternative energy development board installed 200 solar home systems at district khuzdar balochistan in a remote off-grid village karak government of balochistan launched a programme to electrify off-grid villages of various districts through solar technology wind poweredit pakistan is developing wind power plants in jhimpir gharo keti bandar and bin qasim in sindh the government of pakistan decided to develop wind power energy sources due to problems supplying energy to the southern coastal regions of sindh and balochistan the project was undertaken with assistance from the government of china another area with potential is swat which shows good wind conditions in windpower investment the chagai district in balochistan has good potential for wind power in the nukundi area near the afghaniran border with wind speeds often 12.5 higher than average required for energy generation 3 some examples are jhimpir wind power plant operational gharo wind power plant operational bin qasim wind power project under construction tidal poweredit tidal power has not yet been operational in pakistan compared to other renewable energy technologies but in near future it may play a key role some think that tidal power plants in coastal creeks of pakistan can serve the energy crisis conundrum up to some level the coastline of pakistan which is about 1,045km-long with dominant features is the best resource for harnessing tidal energy in sindh two sites creek system of indus delta of 170km and two to five metres tidal heights at the korangi creek are available to exploit the tidal energy sonmiani beach and kalamat are also good prospects of tidal energy in balochistan government has issued licence to private companies to take measures to build tidal power stations in february 2013 since then the engineering work is under process and initially a 10 mw plant is proposed at sonmiani bay construction was expected to start by the end of 2013 referencesedit external linksedit wind power in pakistan solar power in pakistan v t e ethiopia kenya morocco seychelles afghanistan bangladesh bhutan china india kazakhstan nepal pakistan philippines taiwan thailand european union czech republic denmark finland germany greece hungary ireland italy lithuania luxembourg netherlands portugal spain sweden united kingdom albania iceland norway russia canada costa rica honduras mexico united states australia new zealand tuvalu argentina brazil chile colombia
