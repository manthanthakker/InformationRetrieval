wind farm a wind farm is a group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electricity a large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes a wind farm can also be located offshore many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in germany china and the united states for example the largest wind farm in the world gansu wind farm in china has a capacity of over 6,000mw of power in 2012 1 with a goal of 20,000mw by 2020 the alta wind energy center in california united states is the largest onshore wind farm outside of china with a capacity of 1,020mw 2 as of april 2013 the 630mw london array in the uk is the largest offshore wind farm in the world followed by the 504mw greater gabbard wind farm in the uk there are many large wind farms under construction including fosen vind  1000mw sinus holding wind

6.4.2 mitigation  designedit as a general rule economic wind generators require windspeed of 16kmh  10mph or greater an ideal location would have a near constant flow of non-turbulent wind throughout the year with a minimum likelihood of sudden powerful bursts of wind an important factor of turbine siting is also access to local demand or transmission capacity usually sites are screened on the basis of a wind atlas and validated with wind measurements meteorological wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential 3 4 in order to finance the project 5 local winds are often monitored for a year or more and detailed wind maps constructed before wind generators are installed the wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag the increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography surface roughness and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings typically the increase of wind speeds with increasing height follows a wind profile power law which predicts that wind speed rises proportionally to the seventh root of altitude doubling the altitude of a turbine then increases the expected wind speeds by 10 and the expected power by 34 in general a distance of 7d  7  rotor diameter of the wind turbine is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm 6 but micrositing optimizes placement particularly in hilly areas individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage usually 34.5 kv power collection system and communications network at a substation this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage transmission system construction of a land-based wind farm requires installation of the collector system and substation and possibly access roads to each turbine site onshore installationsedit the worlds first wind farm was 0.6 mw consisting of 20 wind turbines rated at 30 kilowatts each installed on the shoulder of crotched mountain in southern new hampshire in december 1980 7 8 onshore turbine installations in hilly or mountainous regions tend to be on ridgelines generally three kilometres or more inland from the nearest shoreline this is done to exploit the topographic acceleration as the wind accelerates over a ridge the additional wind speeds gained in this way can increase energy produced because more wind goes through the turbines the exact position of each turbine matters because a difference of 30m could potentially double output this careful placement is referred to as micro-siting offshore installationsedit europe is the leader in offshore wind energy with the first offshore wind farm vindeby being installed in denmark in 1991 as of 2010 there are 39 offshore wind farms in waters off belgium denmark finland germany ireland the netherlands norway sweden and the united kingdom with a combined operating capacity of 2,396 mw more than 100 gw or 100,000 mw of offshore projects are proposed or under development in europe the european wind energy association has set a target of 40 gw installed by 2020 and 150 gw by 2030 20 as of september 2013 the london array in united kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 1,000 mw followed by greater gabbard wind farm  504 mw also in the uk offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance because water has less surface roughness than land especially deeper water the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water capacity factors utilisation rates are considerably higher than for onshore locations 42 the province of ontario in canada is pursuing several proposed locations in the great lakes including the suspended 43 trillium power wind 1 approximately 20km from shore and over 400 mw in size 44 other canadian projects include one on the pacific west coast 45 as of 2010 there are no offshore wind farms in the united states however projects are under development in wind-rich areas of the east coast great lakes and pacific coast 20 the block island wind farm is scheduled for 2016 46 installation and service  maintenance of off-shore wind farms are a specific challenge for technology and economic operation of a wind farm as of 2015update there are 20 jackup vessels for lifting components but few can lift sizes above 5mw 47 service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 availability higher than 80 of time to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbinescitation needed therefore special fast service vehicles for installation like wind turbine shuttle as well as for maintenance including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions are required so-called inertial and optical based ship stabilization and motion control systems issmc are used for that experimental and proposed wind farmsedit there exist also some wind farms which were mainly built for testing wind turbines in such wind farms there is usually from each type to be tested only a single wind turbine such farms have usually at least one meteorological tower an example of an experimental wind farm is Ã¸sterild wind turbine test field for some time airborne wind farms have been discussed 48 airborne wind farm is a group of airborne wind energy systems in the same location connected to the grid in the same point by regionedit australiaedit canadaedit chinaedit in just five years china leapfrogged the rest of the world in wind energy production going from 2,599 mw of capacity in 2006 to 62,733 mw at the end of 2011 54 55 56 however the rapid growth outpaced chinas infrastructure and new construction slowed significantly in 2012 57 at the end of 2009 wind power in china accounted for 25.1gigawatts gw of electricity generating capacity 58 and china has identified wind power as a key growth component of the countrys economy 59 with its large land mass and long coastline china has exceptional wind resources 60 researchers from harvard and tsinghua university have found that china could meet all of their electricity demands from wind power by 2030 61 by the end of 2008 at least 15 chinese companies were commercially producing wind turbines and several dozen more were producing components 62 turbine sizes of 1.5mw to 3mw became common leading wind power companies in china were goldwind dongfang electric and sinovel 63 along with most major foreign wind turbine manufacturers 64 china also increased production of small-scale wind turbines to about 80,000 turbines  80mw in 2008 through all these developments the chinese wind industry appeared unaffected by the global financial crisis according to industry observers 63 according to the global wind energy council the development of wind energy in china in terms of scale and rhythm is absolutely unparalleled in the world the national peoples congress permanent committee passed a law that requires the chinese energy companies to purchase all the electricity produced by the renewable energy sector 65 european unionedit the european union has a total installed wind capacity of 93,957 mw germany has the third largest capacity in the world after china and the united states with an installed capacity was 29,060 mw at the end of 2011 and spain has 21,674 mw italy and france each had between 6,000 and 7,000 mw 66 67 by january 2014 the uk installed capacity was 10,495 mw 68 but energy production can be different from capacity  in 2010 spain had the highest european wind power production with 43 twh compared to germanys 35 twh 69 europes largest windfarm is the london array an off-shore wind farm in the thames estuary in the united kingdom with a current capacity of 630 mw and thus the worlds largest off-shore wind farm other large wind farms in europe include fÃ¢ntÃ¢nele-cogealac wind farm near constanÈa romania with 600 mw capacity 70 71 and whitelee wind farm near glasgow scotland which has a total capacity of 539 mw an important limiting factor of wind power is variable power generated by wind farms in most locations the wind blows only part of the time which means that there has to be back-up capacity of conventional generating capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing to address this issue it has been proposed to create a supergrid to connect national grids together 72 across western europe ranging from denmark across the southern north sea to england and the celtic sea to ireland and further south to france and spain especially in higueruela which was considered for some time the biggest wind farm in the world 73 the idea is that by the time a low pressure area has moved away from denmark to the baltic sea the next low appears off the coast of ireland therefore while it is true that the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time it will always be blowing somewhere indiaedit india has the fifth largest installed wind power capacity in the world 74 as of 31 march 2014 the installed capacity of wind power was 21136.3 mw mainly spread across tamil nadu state  7253 mw 75 76 wind power accounts nearly 8.5 of indias total installed power generation capacity and it generates 1.6 of the countrys power japanedit moroccoedit morocco has undertaken a vast wind energy program to support the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency in the country the moroccan integrated wind energy project spanning over a period of 10 years with a total investment estimated at $3.25 billion will enable the country to bring the installed capacity from wind energy from 280 mw in 2010 to 2000 mw in 2020 77 78 pakistanedit pakistan has wind corridors in jhimpir gharo and keti bundar

to 33 mw all 20 turbines describes a graceful arc reflecting the shoreline of bangui bay facing the west philippine sea sri lankaedit sri lanka has received funding from the asian development bank amounting to $300 million to invest in renewable energies from this funding as well as $80 million from the sri lankan government and $60 million from frances agence franÃ§aise de dÃ©veloppement sri lanka is building two 100mw wind farms from 2017 due to be completed by late 2020 in northern sri lanka 79 south africaedit as of september 2015 a number of sizable wind farms have been constructed in south africa mostly in the western cape region these include the 100 mw sere wind farm and the 138 mw gouda wind facility most future wind farms in south africa are earmarked for locations along the eastern cape coastline 80 81 82 eskom has constructed one small scale prototype windfarm at klipheuwel in the western cape and another demonstrator site is near darling with phase 1 completed the first commercial wind farm coega wind farm in port elisabeth was developed by the belgian company electrawinds united statesedit us wind power installed capacity in 2012 exceeded 51,630 mw and supplies 3 of the nations electricity 92 93 new installations place the us on a trajectory to generate 20 of the nations electricity by 2030 from wind energy 94 growth in 2008 channeled some $17billion into the economy positioning wind power as one of the leading sources of new power generation in the country along with natural gas wind projects completed in 2008 accounted for about 42 of the entire new power-producing capacity added in the us during the year 95 at the end of 2008 about 85,000 people were employed in the us wind industry 96 and ge energy was the largest domestic wind turbine manufacturer 97 wind projects boosted local tax bases and revitalized the economy of rural communities by providing a steady income stream to farmers with wind turbines on their land 97 wind power in the us provides enough electricity to power the equivalent of nearly 9 million homes avoiding the emissions of 57 million tons of carbon each year and reducing expected carbon emissions from the electricity sector by 2.5 95 texas with 10,929mw of capacity has the most installed wind power capacity of any us state followed by california with 4,570mw and iowa with 4,536mw 93 the alta wind energy center  1,020mw in california is the nations largest wind farm in terms of capacity 2 altamont pass wind farm is the largest wind farm in the us in terms of the number of individual turbines 98 criticismedit public perception is that renewable energies such as wind solar biomass and geothermal are having a significant positive impact on global warming 99 all of these sources combined only supplied 1.3 of global energy in 2013 as 8 billion tonnes of coal was burned annually 100 one of the biggest factors inhibiting wind farm construction is human opposition a study has shown 101 turbine placement close to residents may heighten their uncertainty and concern of the wind turbines and overshadow any positive inclinations towards the development wind farm development is affected by the emphasis being primarily placed on the domain of landscape assessment and environmental impact when seeking farm sites the viability and efficiency of the wind farm are barely touched upon instead falling to the developer for example sturge et al 102 of the university of sheffield wrote that in many countries where wind energy is becoming popular engineering aspects specifically energy yield are not being taken into consideration either by the public or in the process of planning consent for wind farm development as energy is the main purpose of wind farms a lack of attention given to the subject could be detrimental to the general acceptance of wind farms environmental impactedit compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor 104 wind power consumes no fuel and emits no air pollution unlike fossil fuel power sources the energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months 104 while a wind farm may cover a large area of land many land uses such as agriculture are compatible with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use 105 there are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures the scale of the ecological impact may 106 or may not be significant 107 depending on specific circumstances the estimated number of bird deaths caused by wind turbines is between 140,000 and 328,000 whereas deaths caused by domestic cats are estimated to be between 1.3 and 4.0 billion birds each year and over 100 million birds are killed each year by impact with windows 107 prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities and protection of peat bogs affect the siting and operation of wind turbines 108 human healthedit there have been multiple scientific peer-reviewed studies into wind farm noise which have concluded that infrasound from wind farms is not a hazard to human health and there is no verifiable evidence for wind turbine syndrome although some suggest further research might still be useful 109 a 2007 report by the us national research council noted that noise produced by wind turbines is generally not a major concern for humans beyond a half-mile or so low-frequency vibration and its effects on humans are not well understood and sensitivity to such vibration resulting from wind-turbine noise is highly variable among humanscitation needed there are opposing views on this subject and more research needs to be done on the effects of low-frequency noise on humans 110 in a 2009 report about rural wind farms a standing committee of the parliament of new south wales australia recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighbouring houses which can be waived by the affected neighbour as a precautionary approach 111 a 2014 paper suggests that the wind turbine syndrome is mainly caused by the nocebo effect and other psychological mechanisms 107 112 effect on power gridedit utility-scale wind farms must have access to transmission lines to transport energy the wind farm developer may be obliged to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line 113 the company or person that develops the wind farm can then sell the power on the grid through the transmission lines and ultimately chooses whether to hold on to the rights or sell the farm or parts of it to big business like ge for examplecitation needed ground radar interferenceedit wind farms can interfere with ground radar systems used for military weather and air traffic control the large rapidly moving blades of the turbines can return signals to the radar that can be mistaken as an aircraft or weather pattern 114 actual aircraft and weather patterns around wind farms can be accurately detected as there is no fundamental physical constraint preventing that but aging radar infrastructure is significantly challenged with the task 115 116 the us military is using wind turbines on some bases including barstow near the radar test facility 117 118 effectsedit the level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbinesaircraft with respect to the radar an aircraft flying above the wind farms turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future site planning 119 issues include masking shadowing clutter noise and signal alteration 120 radar issues have stalled as much as 10,000 mw of projects in usa 121 some very long range radars are not affected by wind farms 122 mitigationedit permanent problem solving include a non-initiation window to hide the turbines while still tracking aircraft over the wind farm and a similar method mitigates the false returns 123 englands newcastle airport is using a short-term mitigation to blank the turbines on the radar map with a software patch 124 wind turbine blades using stealth technology are being developed to mitigate radar reflection problems for aviation 125 126 127 128 as well as stealth windfarms the future development of infill radar systems could filter out the turbine interference in early 2011 the us government awarded a program to build a radarwind turbine analysis tool this tool will allow developers to predict the impact of a wind farm on a radar system before construction thus allowing rearrangement of the turbines or even the entire wind farm to avoid negative impacts on the radar system 119 129 a mobile radar system the lockheed martin tps-77 has shown in recent tests that it can distinguish between aircraft and wind turbines and more than 170 tps-77 radars are in use around the world in britain the lockheed martin tps-77 system was to be installed at trimingham in norfolk to remove military objections to a series of offshore wind farms in the north sea a second tps-77 was to be installed in the scottish borders overcoming objections to a 48-turbine wind farm at fallago 130 radio reception interferenceedit there are also reports of negative effects on radio and television reception in wind farm communities potential solutions include predictive interference modeling as a component of site selection 131 132 133 agricultureedit a 2010 study found that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas due to the turbulence generated by the blades 134 in another study an analysis carried out on corn and soybean crops in the central areas of the united states noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the late spring and early autumn frosts and also reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves even at the height of summer heat the lowering of 2.5â3 degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades can make a difference for the cultivation of corn 135 see alsoedit renewable energy portal
