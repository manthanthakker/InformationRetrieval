micro combined heat and power micro combined heat and power or micro-chp is an extension of the idea of cogeneration to the singlemulti family home or small office building in the range of up to 50 kw local generation has a higher efficiency as it lacks the 8-10 energy losses when transporting electricity over long distances and the 10–15 energy losses on heat transfer in district heating networks due to the difference between the thermal energy carrier hot water and the colder external environment the most common systems use natural gas as their primary energy source and emit carbon dioxide

gas to produce electricity and heat a micro-chp system is a small fuel cell or a heat engine driving a generator which provide electric power and heat for an individual buildings heating ventilation and air conditioning a micro-chp may primarily follow heat demand delivering electricity as the by-product or may follow electrical demand to generate electricity and heat is the by-product when used primarily for heat in circumstances of fluctuating electrical demand micro-chp systems may generate more electricity than is instantly being demanded the heat engine version is a small scale example of cogeneration schemes which have been used with large electric power plants the purpose is to utilize more of the energy in the fuel the reason for using such systems is that heat engines such as steam power plants which generate the electric power needed for modern life by burning fuel are not very efficient due to carnots theorem a heat engine cannot be 100 efficient it cannot convert anywhere near all the heat produced from the fuel it burns into useful forms such as electricity so heat engines always produce a surplus of low-temperature waste heat called secondary heat or low-grade heat modern plants are limited to efficiencies of about 33–60 at most so 40–67 of the energy is exhausted as waste heat in the past this energy was usually wasted to the environment cogeneration systems built in recent years in cold-climate countries utilize the waste heat produced by large power plants for heating piping hot water from the plant into buildings in the surrounding community however it is not practical to transport heat long distances due to heat loss from the pipes since electricity can be transported practically it is more efficient to generate the electricity near where the waste heat can be used so in a micro-combined heat and power system micro-chp small power plants are instead located where the secondary heat can be used in individual buildings micro-chp are defined by the ec as being of less than 50kw electrical power output in a central power plant the supply of waste heat may exceed the local heat demand in such cases if it is not desirable to reduce the power production the excess waste heat must be disposed in eg cooling towers or sea cooling without being used a way to avoid excess waste heat is to reduce the fuel input to the chp plant reducing both the heat and power output to balance the heat demand in doing this the power production is limited by the heat demand in a traditional power plant delivering electricity to consumers about 30 of the heat content of the primary heat energy source such as biomass coal solar thermal natural gas petroleum or uranium reaches the consumer although the efficiency can be 20 for very old plants and 45 for newer gas plants in contrast a chp system converts 15–42 of the primary heat to electricity and most of the remaining heat is captured for hot water or space heating in total as much as 90 of the heat from the primary energy source goes to useful purposes when heat production does not exceed the demand chp systems are able to increase the total energy utilization of primary energy sources such as fuel and concentrated solar thermal energy thus chp has been steadily gaining popularity in all sectors of the energy economy due to the increased costs of electricity and fuel particularly fossil fuels and due to environmental concerns particularly climate change 1 chp systems have benefited the industrial sector since the beginning of the industrial revolution for three decades these larger chp systems were more economically justifiable than micro-chp due to the economy of scale after the year 2000 micro-chp has become cost effective in many markets around the world due to rising energy costs the development of micro-chp systems has also been facilitated by recent technological developments of small heat engines this includes improved performance and cost-effectiveness of fuel cells stirling engines steam engines gas turbines diesel engines and otto engines pemfc fuel cell mchp operates at low temperature  50 to 100c and needs high purity hydrogen its prone to contamination changes are made to operate at higher temperatures and improvements on the fuel reformer sofc fuel cell mchp operates at a high temperature  500 to 1,000 cp and can handle different energy sources well but the high temperature requires expensive materials to handle the temperature changes are made to operate at a lower temperature because of the higher temperature sofc in general has a longer start-up time and need continuous heat output even in times when there is no thermal demand chp systems linked to absorption chillers can use waste heat for refrigeration 2 a 2013 uk report from ecuity consulting stated that mchp is the most cost-effective method of utilising gas to generate energy at the domestic level 3 4 delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64 of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional engine-based micro-chp systems in sales in 2012 5 technologiesedit micro-chp engine systems are currently based on several different technologies 6 internal combustion engines stirling engines fuel cell microturbines steam enginesteam motor using either the traditional water or organic chemicals such as refrigerants fuelsedit there are many types of fuels and sources of heat that may be considered for micro-chp the properties of these sources vary in terms of system cost heat cost environmental effects convenience ease of transportation and storage system maintenance and system life some of the heat sources and fuels that are being considered for use with micro-chp include natural gas lpg biomass vegetable oil such as rapeseed oil woodgas solar thermal and lately also hydrogen as well as multi-fuel systems the energy sources with the lowest emissions of particulates and net-carbon dioxide include solar power hydrogen biomass with two-stage gasification into biogas and natural gas due to the high efficiency of the chp process cogeneration has still lower carbon emissions compared to energy transformation in fossil driven boilers or thermal power plants the majority of cogeneration systems use natural gas for fuel because natural gas burns easily and cleanly it can be inexpensive it is available in most areas and is easily transported through pipelines which already exist for many homes engine typesedit natural gas is suitable for internal combustion engines such as otto engine and gas turbine systems gas turbines are used in many small systems due to their high efficiency small size clean combustion durability and low maintenance requirements gas turbines designed with foil bearings and air-cooling operate without lubricating oil or coolants the waste heat of gas turbines is mostly in the exhaust whereas the waste heat of reciprocating internal combustion engines is split between the exhaust and cooling system external combustion engines can run on any high-temperature heat source these engines include the stirling engine hot gas turbocharger and the steam engine both range from 10-20 efficiency and as of 2014 small quantities are in production for micro-chp products other possibilities include the organic rankine cycle which operates at lower temperatures and pressures using low-grade heat sources the primary advantage to this is that the equipment is essentially an air-conditioning or refrigeration unit operating as an engine whereby the piping and other components need not be designed for extreme temperatures and pressures reducing cost and complexity electrical efficiency suffers but it is presumed that such a system would be utilizing waste heat or a heat source such as a wood stove or gas boiler that would exist anyway for purposes of space heating the future of combined heat and power particularly for homes and small businesses will continue to be affected by the price of fuel including natural gas as fuel prices continue to climb this will make the economics more favorable for energy conservation measures and more efficient energy use including chp and micro-chp fuel cellsedit fuel cells generate electricity and heat as a by product the advantages for a stationary fuel cell application over stirling chp are no moving parts less maintenance and quieter operation the surplus electricity can be delivered back to the grid 7 pemfc fuel cells fueled by natural gas or propane use a steam reformer to convert methane in the gas supply into carbon dioxide and hydrogen the hydrogen then reacts with oxygen in the fuel cell to produce electricity 8 a pemfc fuel cell based micro-chp has an electrical efficiency of 37 lhv and 33 hhv and a heat recovery efficiency of 52 lhv and 47 hhv with a service life of 40,000 hours or 4000 startstop cycles which is equal to 10 year use an estimated 138,000 fuel cell chp systems below 1kw had been installed in japan by the end of 2014 6 most of these chp systems are pemfc based  85 and the remaining are sofc systems in 2013 lifetime is around 60,000 hours for pem fuel cell units which shut down at night this equates to an estimated lifetime of between ten and fifteen years 9 united states department of energy doe technical targets 1–10kw

thermoelectric generators operating on the seebeck effect show promise due to their total absence of moving parts efficiency however is the major concern as most thermoelectric devices fail to achieve 5 efficiency even with high temperature differences solar micro-chpedit cpvtedit this can be achieved by photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector another option is concentrated photovoltaics and thermal cpvt also sometimes called combined heat and power solar chaps is a cogeneration technology used in concentrated photovoltaics that produce both electricity and heat in the same module the heat may be employed in district heating water heating and air conditioning desalination or process heat cpvt systems are currently in production in europe 11 with zenith solar developing cpvt systems with a claimed efficiency of 72 12 sopogy produces a micro concentrated solar power microcsp system based on parabolic trough which can be installed above building or homes the heat can be used for water heating or solar air conditioning a steam turbine can also be installed to produce electricity chppvedit the recent development of small scale chp systems has provided the opportunity for in-house power backup of residential-scale photovoltaic pv arrays 13 the results of a recent study show that a pvchp hybrid system not only has the potential to radically reduce energy waste in the status quo electrical and heating systems but it also enables the share of solar pv to be expanded by about a factor of five 13 in some regions in order to reduce waste from excess heat an absorption chiller has been proposed to utilize the chp-produced thermal energy for cooling of pv-chp system 14 these trigenpv systems have the potential to save even more energy net meteringedit to date micro-chp systems achieve much of their savings and thus attractiveness to consumers by the value of electrical energy which is replaced by the autoproduced electricity a generate-and-resell or net metering model supports this as home-generated power exceeding the instantaneous in-home needs is sold back to the electrical utility this system is efficient because the energy used is distributed and used instantaneously over the electrical grid the main losses are in the transmission from the source to the consumer which will typically be less than losses incurred by storing energy locally or generating power at less than the peak efficiency of the micro-chp system so from a purely technical standpoint dynamic demand management and net-metering are very efficient another positive to net-metering is the fact that it is fairly easy to configure the users electrical meter is simply able to record electrical power exiting as well as entering the home or business as such it records the net amount of power entering the home for a grid with relatively few micro-chp users no design changes to the electrical grid need be made additionally in the united states federal and now many state regulations require utility operators to compensate anyone adding power to the grid from the standpoint of grid operator these points present operational and technical as well as administrative burdens as a consequence most grid operators compensate non-utility power-contributors at less than or equal to the rate they charge their customers while this compensation scheme may seem almost fair at first glance it only represents the consumers cost-savings of not purchasing utility power versus the true cost of generation and operation to the micro-chp operator thus from the standpoint of micro-chp operators net-metering is not ideal while net-metering is a very efficient mechanism for using excess energy generated by a micro-chp system it does have detractors of the detractors main points the first to consider is that while the main generating source on the electrical grid is a large commercial generator net-metering generators spill power to the smart grid in a haphazard and unpredictable fashion however the effect is negligible if there are only a small percentage of customers generating electricity and each of them generates a relatively small amount of electricity when turning on an oven or space heater about the same amount of electricity is drawn from the grid as a home generator puts out if the percentage of homes with generating systems becomes large then the effect on the grid may become significant coordination among the generating systems in homes and the rest of the grid may be necessary for reliable operation and to prevent damage to the grid market
