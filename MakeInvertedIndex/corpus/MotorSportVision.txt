and snetterton circuits from grovewood securities and established the brands hatch leisure bhl company the following year the company acquired cadwell park before foulston died testing a mclaren canam car at silverstone ownership of bhl passed to his wife mary but the company was run by john webb until 1990 when daughter nicola foulston took over the running in that time brands hatch hosted higher-profile series such as formula 3000 and superbike world championship racing 1988 saw further changes to the circuit layout with a chicane added at dingle dell corner while westfield bend and graham hill bend were tightened new pits and a corporate entertainment facility were added in the late-1990s in 1999 foulston announced that brands hatch had acquired the rights to the british grand prix from 2002 3 whilst discussions were ongoing with regards to planning permission to bring the circuit up to f1 requirements foulston sold bhl to octagon motorsports a subsidiary of interpublic for Â£120m 4 octagon however failed to obtain the necessary planning permission and instead decided to lease silverstone in order to host the grand prix 5 however high-profile single-seater racing did return to brands hatch in 2003 when a round of the cart series was held at the circuit 6 despite attracting around 40,000 spectators 7 the race was not retained for subsequent seasons with financial pressures stemming from running the british grand prix 8 octagon sold off the group of four circuits 9 including brands hatch to the motorsport vision group headed by ex-f1 driver jonathan palmer in 2004 10 oulton parkedit after many years of decay oulton was given new life when it was bought by motorsport vision msv redeveloped the circuit in 2007 oulton park was voted the best uk circuit by british superbike fans 11 whilst a btcc meeting on sunday 27 july 2008 saw a crowd of 35,000 attend - a record not only for the circuit but the highest crowd at any venue of the btcc for a decade 12 snettertonedit snetterton has undergone perhaps the most radical transformation of all the motorsport vision circuits since being taken over in 2004 new spectator banking has been added to the track to improve circuit views whilst the restaurant and toilet facilities have been updated or replaced a new scrutineering bay has also been added snetterton is regarded as being one of the fastest tracks in the uk thanks to its combination of several long straights and relatively few corners the lap record currently stands at 56.095 seconds or an average speed of 125.27mph cadwell parkedit in 1953 the track was lengthened to 1.3 miles  2.1km upon the invitation of the 500 cc motorcycle-engined formula 3 to race in a traditional bike meeting around 30,000 spectators attended that particular race the original track grew to the current 2.25 miles  3.62km layout in 1962 and hosted the british f3 series the next may some of the bends are named after family members eg mansfield charlie and chris cadwell is now considered too narrow for high level car races although club motorsport associations such as the barc and 750mc still hold meetings the layout is ideal for bikes however with the british superbike championship round being the most popular event on the championships calendar several tests and feature clips for the motoring program fifth gear have been filmed here bedford autodromeedit the track in thurleigh near bedford is owned by motorsport vision no official motorsport events are held at the circuit but it is a popular public track day circuit it is also the home

fpa was founded in 1998 by jonathan palmer the ethos of fpa is to keep costs at a minimum whilst at all times promoting competitive and professional racing the series is known for producing ex-f1 driver and indycar race-winner justin wilson and helping the career of triple world touring car champion andy priaulx in order to keep a level playing field as much as possible all the formula palmer audi cars are run by a specialist team of fpa mechanics rather than having separate teams this concept of a large group of deliberately equalised cars has since been adopted by a1gp fpa has recently announced a scholarship prize with the brdc stars of tomorrow kf2 karting championship 17 and with the newly revived fia formula two championship 18 positioning the series as a fantastic intermediary step between karts and top-level single seaters fia formula two championshipedit the fia formula two championship was the revival of the formula two series that was highly successful from 1967 to 1985 it saw 24 drivers competing in identical motorsport vision-run cars with a 400bhp audi engine over 16 rounds the fias overall concern was that the cost of competing in motor racing at a level to progress directly to formula one today is so high that it prevents many talented drivers from having the opportunity to participate in september 2008 the fia tender to supply the cars and operate the fia formula two championship was awarded to motorsport vision compared to rival series formula two will cost significantly less per season whilst allowing drivers to prove their skill and develop their racecraft in identical vehicles designed by a six-man team from williamsf1 led by director of engineering patrick head the series was marred by the tragic death of henry surtees who died in an accident during a race at brands hatch the series folded in 2012 motorsport vision formula three cupedit f3 cup is a national motor racing series that takes place primarily in the united kingdom with

using identical 2.0-litre cars built by ralph firmans rfr company the series was rebranded as the brdc british formula 3 championship to reflect the pace of the new cars in use from the 2016 british
