geothermal energy in the united states geothermal energy in the united states generated a record of about 16.792 million megawatt-hours in 2012 narrowly beating the previous record of 16.789 set in 1993 1 in 2012 the united states led the world in geothermal electricity production with 3,386 megawatts mw of installed capacity 2 3 the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at the geysers a geothermal field in california 4 the united states generates an average of 15 billion kilowatt hours of geothermal power per year comparable to burning some 25 million barrels  4,000,000m3 of oil or 6 million short tons of coal per year 5 in the twelve months through april 2013 geothermal energy generated 16.9 million megawatt-hours 0.41 of total us electricity 1 geothermal power plants are largely concentrated in the western states they are the fourth largest source of renewable electricity after hydroelectricity biomass and wind power a geothermal resource assessment shows that nine western states together have the potential to provide over 20 percent of national electricity needs 5 6  contents 1 history 2 plants 2.1 by state 3 production and development 4

territory of the united states for more than 10,000 years the paleo-indians first used geothermal hot springs for warmth cleansing and minerals 5 the first commercial geothermal power plant producing power to the us utility grid opened at the geysers in california in 1960 producing eleven megawatts of net power the geysers system continues to operate successfully today and the complex has grown into the largest geothermal development in the world with an output of 750 mw 5 plantsedit the largest dry steam field in the world is the geysers 116km  72mi north of san francisco it was here that pacific gas and electric began operation of the first successful geothermal electric power plant in the united states in 1960 7 the original turbine lasted for more than 30years and produced 11mw net power 8 the geysers has 1517megawatt mw 9 of active installed capacity with an average capacity factor of 63 10 calpine corporation owns 15 of the 18 active plants in the geysers and is currently the united states largest producer of geothermal energy 11 two other plants are owned jointly by the northern california power agency and the city of santa claras municipal electric utility now called silicon valley power the remaining bottle rock power plant owned by the us renewables group has only recently been reopened 12 a nineteenth plant is now under development by ram power formerly western geopower since the activities of one geothermal plant affects those nearby the consolidation plant ownership at the geysers has been beneficial because the plants operate cooperatively instead of in their own short-term interest the geysers is now recharged by injecting treated sewage effluent from the city of santa rosa and the lake county sewage treatment plant this sewage effluent used to be dumped into rivers and streams and is now piped to the geothermal field where it replenishes the steam produced for power generation another major geothermal area is located in south central california on the southeast side of the salton sea near the cities of niland and calipatria california in 2001 there were 15 geothermal plants producing electricity in the area calenergy owns about half of them and the rest are owned by various companies combined the plants have a capacity of about 570 mw hudson ranch i geothermal plant a 50 mw plant opened in may 2012 the first in the area in 20 years a second similar plant is to open in 2013 13 the basin and range geologic province in nevada southeastern oregon southwestern idaho arizona and western utah is now an area of rapid geothermal development several small power plants were built during the late 1980s during times of high power prices rising energy costs have spurred new development plants in nevada at steamboat springs bradydesert peak dixie valley soda lake stillwater and beowawe now produce about 235 mw by stateedit installed geothermal capacity in megawatts mw by state as of february 2013 2 production and developmentedit with 3,040.27 mw of installed geothermal capacity the united states remains the world leader with 30 of the online capacity total 3 the future outlook for expanded production from conventional and enhanced geothermal systems is positive as new technologies promise increased growth in locations previously not considered 15 as of august 2008 103 new projects are under way in 13 us states when developed these projects could potentially supply up to 3,979 mw of power meeting the needs of about 4 million homes at this rate of development geothermal production in the united states could exceed 15,000 mw by 2025 15 the most significant catalyst behind new industry activity is the energy policy act of 2005 this act made new geothermal plants eligible for the full federal production tax credit previously available only to wind power projects and certain kinds of biomass it also authorized and directed increased funding for research by the department of energy and enabled the bureau of land management to address its backlog of geothermal leases and permits 3 in april 2008 exploratory drilling began at newberry volcano in oregon 16 in 2009 investment bank credit suisse calculated that geothermal power costs 3.6 cents per kilowatt-hour versus 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour for coal if geothermal receives loans with lower rates than offered by the market 17 reliabilityedit unlike some other renewable power sources such as wind and solar geothermal energy is dispatchable meaning that it is both available whenever needed and can quickly adjust output to match demand according to the us energy information administration eia of all types of new electrical generation plants geothermal generators have the highest capacity factor a measure of how much power a facility actually generates as a percent of its maximum capacity the eia rates new geothermal plants as having a 92 capacity factordubious  discuss higher than those of nuclear  90 gas  87 or coal  85 and much higher than those of intermittent sources such as onshore wind  34 or solar photovoltaic  25 18 while the carrier medium for geothermal electricity water must be properly managed the source of geothermal energy the earths heat will be available for most intents and purposes indefinitely 5dead link 19 in 2008 the usdoe funded research in enhanced geothermal systems egs to learn more about the fracture systems in geothermal reservoirs and better predict the results of reservoir stimulation the doe geothermal technologies program part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 provided funding to establish the national geothermal data system ngds through the ngds many older paper archives and drill logs that are stored at state geological surveys are now being digitized and made available for free to the public 20 environmental effectsedit the underground hot water and steam used to generate geothermal power may contain chemicals that could pollute the air and water if released at the surface hydrogen sulfide which is toxic in high concentrations is sometimes found in geothermal systems 21 newer methods of generating geothermal power separate the hot steam collected underground from the steam used to power turbines and substantially reduce the risk of releasing air-polluting contaminants 22 the water mixed with the steam contains dissolved salts that can damage pipes and harm aquatic ecosystems 23 some subsurface water associated with geothermal sources contain high concentrations of toxic elements such as boron lead and arsenic injection of water in enhanced geothermal systems may cause induced seismicity earthquakes at the geysers geothermal field in california the largest being richter magnitude 4.6 have been linked to injected water 24 possible effects include scenery spoliation drying out of hot springs soil erosion noise pollution and chemical pollution of the atmosphere and of surface- and groundwaters 25 see alsoedit
