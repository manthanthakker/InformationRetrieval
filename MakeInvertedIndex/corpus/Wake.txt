wake in fluid dynamics a wake may either be the region of recirculating flow immediately behind a moving or stationary blunt body caused by viscosity which may be accompanied by flow separation and turbulence or the wave pattern on the water surface downstream of an object in a flow or produced by a moving object eg a ship caused by pressure differences of the fluids above and below the free surface and gravity or surface tension or both  contents 1 wake effects caused by viscosity 2 waves by density differences like a water surface 2.1 kelvin wake pattern 3 gallery 4 other effects 5

turbulent downstream of a solid body moving through a fluid caused by the flow of the fluid around the body for a blunt body in subsonic external flow for example the apollo or orion capsules during descent and landing the wake is massively separated and behind the body is a reverse flow region where the flow is moving toward the body this phenomenon is often observed in wind tunnel testing of aircraft and is especially important when parachute systems are involved because unless the parachute lines extend the canopy beyond the reverse flow region the chute can fail to inflate and thus collapse parachutes deployed into wakes suffer dynamic pressure deficits which reduce their expected drag forces high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations are often undertaken to model wake flows although such modeling has uncertainties associated with turbulence modeling for example rans versus les implementations in addition to unsteady flow effects example applications include rocket stage separation and aircraft store separation waves by density differences like a water surfaceedit in incompressible fluids liquids such as water a bow wake is created when a watercraft moves through the medium as the medium cannot be compressed it must be displaced instead resulting in a wave as with all wave forms it spreads outward from the source until its energy is overcome or lost usually by friction or dispersion the non-dimensional parameter of interest is the froude number kelvin wake patternedit waterfowl and boats moving across the surface of water produce a wake pattern first explained mathematically by lord kelvin and known today as the kelvin wake pattern 1 this pattern consists of two wake lines that form the arms of a chevron v with the source of the wake at the vertex of the v for sufficiently slow motion each wake line is offset from the path of the wake source by around arcsin 1/3  19.47 and is made up of feathery wavelets angled at roughly 53 to the path the inside of the v of total opening 39 as indicated above is filled with transverse curved waves each of which is an arc of a circle centered at a point lying on the path at a distance twice that of the arc to the wake source this pattern is independent of the speed and size of the wake source over a significant range of values 2 however the pattern changes at high speeds only viz above a hull froude number of approximately 0.5 then as the sources speed increases the transverse waves diminish and the points of maximum amplitude on the wavelets form a second v within the wake pattern which grows narrower with the increased speed of the source 3 the angles in this pattern are not intrinsic properties of merely water any isentropic and incompressible liquid with low viscosity will exhibit the same phenomenon furthermore this phenomenon has nothing to do with turbulence everything discussed here is based on the linear theory of an ideal fluid cf airy wave theory parts of the pattern may be obscured by the effects of propeller wash and tail eddies behind the boats stern and by the boat being a large object and not a point source the water need not be stationary but may be moving as in a large river and the important consideration then is the velocity of the water relative to a boat or other object causing a wake this pattern follows from the dispersion relation of deep water waves which is often written as where deep means that the depth is greater than half of the wavelength this formula implies that the group velocity of a deep water wave is half of its phase velocity which in turn goes as the square root of the wavelength two velocity parameters of importance for the wake pattern are as the surface object moves it continuously generates small disturbances which are the sum of sinusoidal waves with a wide spectrum of wavelengths those waves with the longest wavelengths have phase speeds above v and dissipate into the surrounding water and are not easily observed other waves with phase speeds at or below v however are amplified through constructive interference and form visible shock waves stationary in position wrt the boat the angle θ between the phase shock wave front and the path of the object is θ  arcsincv if cv  1 or  −1 no later waves can catch up with earlier waves and no shockwave forms in deep water shock waves form even from slow-moving sources because waves with short enough wavelengths move slower these shock waves are at sharper angles than one would naively expect because it is group velocity that dictates the area of constructive interference and in deep water the group velocity is half of the phase velocity all shock waves that each by itself would have had an angle between 33 and 72 are compressed into a narrow band of wake with angles between 15 and 19 with the strongest constructive interference at the outer edge angle arcsin 1/3  19.47 placing the two arms of the v in the celebrated kelvin wake pattern a concise geometric construction 4 demonstrates that strikingly this group shock angle wrt the path of the boat 19.47 for any and all of the above θ is actually independent of v c and g it merely relies on the fact that the group velocity is half of the phase velocity c on any planet slow-swimming objects have effective mach number 3 for slow swimmers low froude number the lighthillwhitham geometric argument that the opening of the kelvin chevron wedge v pattern is universal goes as follows consider a boat moving from right to left with constant speed v emitting waves of varying wavelength and thus wavenumber k and phase velocity ck of interest when  v for a shock wave cf eg sonic boom or cherenkov radiation equivalently and more intuitively fix the position of the boat and have the water flow in the opposite direction like a piling in a river focus first on a given k emitting phase wavefronts whose stationary position wrt the boat assemble to the standard shock wedge tangent to all of them cf fig.12.3 as indicated above the openings of these chevrons vary with wavenumber the angle θ between the phase shock wavefront and the path of the boat the water being θ  arcsincv  π/2  ψ evidently ψ increases with k however these phase chevrons are not visible it is their corresponding group wave manifestations which are observed consider one of the phase circles of fig.12.3 for a particular k corresponding to the time t in the past fig.12.2 its radius is qs and the phase chevron side is the tangent ps to it evidently pq vt and sq  ct  vt cosψ as the right angle psq places s on the semicircle of diameter pq since the group velocity is half the phase velocity for any and all k however the visible group disturbance point corresponding to s will be t the midpoint of sq similarly it lies on a semicircle now centered on r where manifestly rqpq/4 an effective group wavefront emitted from r with radius vt/4 now significantly the resulting wavefront angle with the boats path the angle of the tangent from p to this smaller circle obviously has a sine of trpr=1/3 for any and all k c ψ g etc strikingly virtually all parameters of the problem have dropped out except for the deep-water group-to-phase-velocity relation note the highly notional effective group disturbance emitter moves slower at 3v/4 thus summing over all relevant k and ts to flesh out an effective fig.12.3 shock pattern the universal kelvin wake pattern arises the full visible chevron angle is twice that 2arcsin 1/3  39 the wavefronts of the wavelets in the wake are at 53 which is roughly the average of 33 and 72 the wave components with would-be shock wave angles between 73 and 90 dominate the interior of the v they end up half-way between the point of generation and the current location of the wake source this explains the curvature of the arcs those very short waves with would-be shock wave angles below 33 lack a mechanism to reinforce their amplitudes through constructive interference and are usually seen as small ripples on top of the interior transverse waves galleryedit wake of a boat crossing an alpine lake koenigsee 39 ship wake the wakes of two slow-moving boats

within some distance of shore 5 in order to facilitate recreation by other boats and reduce the damage wakes cause powered narrowboats on british canals are not permitted to create a breaking wash a wake large enough to create a breaking wave along the banks as this erodes them this rule normally restricts these vessels to 4 statute miles per hour or less wakes are occasionally used recreationally swimmers people riding personal watercraft and aquatic mammals such as dolphins can ride the leading edge of a wake in the sport of wakeboarding the wake is used as a jump the wake is also used to propel a surfer in the sport of wakesurfing in the sport of water polo the ball carrier can swim while advancing the ball propelled ahead with the wake created by alternating armstrokes
