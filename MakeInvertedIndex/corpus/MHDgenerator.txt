magnetohydrodynamic generator a magnetohydrodynamic generator mhd generator is a magnetohydrodynamic device that transforms thermal energy and kinetic energy into electricity mhd generators are different from traditional electric generators in that they operate at high temperatures without moving parts mhd was developed because the hot exhaust gas of an mhd generator can heat the boilers of a steam power plant increasing overall efficiency mhd was developed as a topping cycle to increase the efficiency of electric generation especially when burning coal or natural gas mhd dynamos are the complement of mhd propulsors which have been applied to pump liquid metals and in several experimental ship engines an mhd generator like a conventional generator relies on moving a conductor through a magnetic field to generate electric current the mhd generator uses hot conductive plasma as the moving conductor the mechanical dynamo in contrast uses the motion of mechanical devices to accomplish this mhd generators are technically practical for fossil fuels but have been overtaken by other less expensive technologies such as combined cycles in which a gas turbines or molten carbonate fuel cells exhaust heats steam to power a steam turbine natural mhd dynamos are an active area of research in plasma physics and are of great interest to the geophysics and astrophysics communities since the magnetic fields of the earth and sun are produced by these natural dynamos  contents 1 principle 2 power generation 2.1 faraday generator 2.2 hall generator 2.3 disc generator 2.4 generator

lorentz force law describes the effects of a charged particle moving in a constant magnetic field the simplest form of this law is given by the vector equation where f is the force acting on the particle q is the charge of the particle v is the velocity of the particle and b is the magnetic field the vector f is perpendicular to both v and b according to the right hand rule power generationedit typically for a large scale power station to approach the operational efficiency of computer models steps must be taken to increase the electrical conductivity of the conductive substance the heating of a gas to its plasma state or the addition of other easily ionizable substances like the salts of alkali metals can accomplish this increase in practice a number of issues must be considered in the implementation of an mhd generator generator efficiency economics and toxic byproducts these issues are affected by the choice of one of the three mhd generator designs the faraday generator the hall generator and the disc generator faraday generatoredit the faraday generator is named after the man who first looked for the effect in the thames river see history a simple faraday generator would consist of a wedge-shaped pipe or tube of some non-conductive material when an electrically conductive fluid flows through the tube in the presence of a significant perpendicular magnetic field a voltage is induced in the field which can be drawn off as electrical power by placing the electrodes on the sides at 90 degree angles to the magnetic field there are limitations on the density and type of field used the amount of power that can be extracted is proportional to the cross sectional area of the tube and the speed of the conductive flow the conductive substance is also cooled and slowed by this process mhd generators typically reduce the temperature of the conductive substance from plasma temperatures to just over 1000c the main practical problem of a faraday generator is that differential voltages and currents in the fluid short through the electrodes on the sides of the duct the most powerful waste is from the hall effect current this makes the faraday duct very inefficient most further refinements of mhd generators have tried to solve this problem the optimal magnetic field on duct-shaped mhd generators is a sort of saddle shape to get this field a large generator requires an extremely powerful magnet many research groups have tried to adapt superconducting magnets to this purpose with varying success hall generatoredit the most common solution is to use the hall effect to create a current that flows with the fluid the normal scheme is to place arrays of short vertical electrodes on the sides of the duct the first and last electrodes in the duct power the load each other electrode is shorted to an electrode on the opposite side of the duct these shorts of the faraday current induce a powerful magnetic field within the fluid but in a chord of a circle at right angles to the faraday current this secondary induced field makes current flow in a rainbow shape between the first and last electrodes losses are less than a faraday generator and voltages are higher because there is less shorting of the final induced current however this design has problems because the speed of the material flow requires the middle electrodes to be offset to catch the faraday currents as the load varies the fluid flow speed varies misaligning the faraday current with its intended electrodes and making the generators efficiency very sensitive to its load disc generatoredit the third and currently the most efficient design is the hall effect disc generator this design currently holds the efficiency and energy density records for mhd generation a disc generator has fluid flowing between the center of a disc and a duct wrapped around the edge the magnetic excitation field is made by a pair of circular helmholtz coils above and below the disk the faraday currents flow in a perfect dead short around the periphery of the disk the hall effect currents flow between ring electrodes near the center and ring electrodes near the periphery another significant advantage of this design is that the magnet is more efficient first it has simple parallel field lines second because the fluid is processed in a disk the magnet can be closer to the fluid and magnetic field strengths increase as the 7th power of distancecitation needed finally the generator is compact for its power so the magnet is also smaller the resulting magnet uses a much smaller percentage of the generated power generator efficiencyedit as of 1994 the 22 efficiency record for closed-cycle disc mhd generators was held by tokyo technical institute the peak enthalpy extraction in these experiments reached 30.2 typical open-cycle hall  duct coal mhd generators are lower near 17 these efficiencies make mhd unattractive by itself for utility power generation since conventional rankine cycle power plants easily reach 40 however the exhaust of an mhd generator burning fossil fuel is almost as hot as the flame of a conventional steam boiler by routing its exhaust gases into a boiler to make steam mhd and a steam rankine cycle can convert fossil fuels into electricity with an estimated efficiency up to 60 percent compared to the 40 percent of a typical coal plant a magnetohydrodynamic generator might also be the first stage of a gas-cooled nuclear reactor 1 economicsedit mhd generators have not been employed for large scale mass energy conversion because other techniques with comparable efficiency have a lower lifecycle investment cost advances in natural gas turbines achieved similar thermal efficiencies at lower costs by having the turbines exhaust drive a rankine cycle steam plant to get more electricity from coal it is cheaper to simply add more low-temperature steam-generating capacity a coal-fueled mhd generator is a type of brayton power cycle similar to the power cycle of a combustion turbine however unlike the combustion turbine there are no moving mechanical parts the electrically conducting plasma provides the moving electrical conductor the side walls and electrodes merely withstand the pressure within while the anode and cathode conductors collect the electricity that is generated all brayton cycles are heat engines ideal brayton cycles also have an ideal efficiency equal to ideal carnot cycle efficiency thus the potential for high energy efficiency from an mhd generator all brayton cycles have higher potential for efficiency the higher the firing temperature while a combustion turbine is limited in maximum temperature by the strength of its airwater or steam-cooled rotating airfoils there are no rotating parts in an open-cycle mhd generator this upper bound in temperature limits the energy efficiency in combustion turbines the upper bound on brayton cycle temperature for an mhd generator is not limited so inherently an mhd generator has a higher potential capability for energy efficiency the temperatures at which linear coal-fueled mhd generators can operate are limited by factors that include a the combustion fuel oxidizer and oxidizer preheat temperature which limit the maximum temperature of the cycle b the ability to protect the sidewalls and electrodes from melting c the ability to protect the electrodes from electrochemical attack from the hot slag coating the walls combined with the high current or arcs that impinge on the electrodes as they carry off the direct current from the plasma and d by the capability of the electrical insulators between each electrode coal-fired mhd plants with oxygenair and high oxidant preheats would probably provide potassium seeded plasmas of about 4200 deg f 10 atmospheres pressure and begin expansion at mach 1.2 these plants would recover mhd exhaust heat for oxidant preheat and for combined cycle steam generation with aggressive assumptions one doe-funded feasibility study of where the technology could go 1000 mwe advanced coal-fired mhdsteam binary cycle power plant conceptual design published in june 1989 showed that a large coal-fired mhd combined cycle plant could attain a hhv energy efficiency approaching 60 percentwell in excess of other coal-fueled technologies so the potential for low operating costs exists however no testing at those aggressive conditions or size has yet occurred and there are no large mhd generators now under test there is simply an inadequate reliability track record to provide confidence in a commercial coal-fueled mhd design u25b mhd testing in russia using natural gas as fuel used a superconducting magnet and had an output of 1.4 megawatts a coal-fired mhd generator series of tests funded by the us department of energy doe in 1992 produced mhd power from a larger superconducting magnet at the component development and integration facility cdif in butte montana none of these tests were conducted for long-enough durations to verify the commercial durability of the technology neither of the test facilities were in large-enough scale for a commercial unit superconducting magnets are used in the larger mhd generators to eliminate one of the large parasitic losses the power needed to energize the electromagnet superconducting magnets once charged consume no power and can develop intense magnetic fields 4 teslas and higher the only parasitic load for the magnets are to maintain refrigeration and to make up the small losses for the non-supercritical connections because of the high temperatures the non-conducting walls of the channel must be constructed from an exceedingly heat-resistant substance such as yttrium oxide or zirconium dioxide to retard oxidation similarly the electrodes must be both conductive and heat-resistant at high temperatures the avco coal-fueled mhd generator at the cdif was tested with water-cooled copper electrodes capped with platinum tungsten stainless steel and electrically conducting ceramics toxic byproductsedit mhd reduces overall production of hazardous fossil fuel wastes because it increases plant efficiency in mhd coal plants the patented commercial econoseed process developed by the us see below recycles potassium ionization seed from the fly ash captured by the stack-gas scrubber however this equipment is an additional expense if molten metal is the armature fluid of an mhd generator care must be taken with the coolant of the electromagnetics and channel the alkali metals commonly used as mhd fluids react violently with water also the chemical byproducts of heated electrified alkali metals and channel ceramics may be poisonous and environmentally persistent historyedit the first practical mhd power research was funded in 1938 in the us by westinghouse in its pittsburgh pennsylvania laboratories headed by hungarian bela karlovitz the initial patent on mhd is by b karlovitz us patent no 2,210,918 process for the conversion of energy august 13 1940 world war ii interrupted development in 1962 the first international conference on mhd power was held in newcastle upon tyne uk by dr brian c lindley of the international research and development company ltd the group set up a steering committee to set up further conferences and disseminate ideas in 1964 the group set up a second conference in paris france in consultation with the european nuclear energy agency since membership in the enea was limited the group persuaded the international atomic energy agency to sponsor a third conference in salzburg austria july 1966 negotiations at this meeting converted the steering committee into a periodic reporting group the ilg-mhd international liaison group mhd under the enea and later in 1967 also under the international atomic energy agency further research in the 1960s by r rosa established the practicality of mhd for fossil-fueled systems in the 1960s avco everett aeronautical research began a series of experiments ending with the mk v generator of 1965 this generated 35 mw but used about 8mw to drive its magnet in 1966 the ilg-mhd had its first formal meeting in paris france it began issuing a periodic status report in 1967 this pattern persisted in this institutional form up until 1976 toward the end of the 1960s interest in mhd declined because nuclear power was becoming more widely available in the late 1970s as interest in nuclear power declined interest in mhd increased in 1975 unesco became persuaded the mhd might be the most efficient way to utilise world coal reserves and in 1976 sponsored the ilg-mhd in 1976 it became clear that no nuclear reactor in the next 25 years would use mhd so the international atomic energy agency and enea both nuclear agencies withdrew support from the ilg-mhd leaving unesco as the primary sponsor of the ilg-mhd bosnian developmentedit over more than a ten-year span bosnian engineers in bosnia in the institute of thermal and nuclear technology iten energoinvest co sarajevo had built the first experimental magneto-hydrodynamic facility power generator in 1989 it was here it was first patented 2  3 us developmentedit in the 1980s the us department of energy began a vigorous multiyear program culminating in a 1992 50mw demonstration coal combustor at the component development and integration facility cdif in butte montana this program also had significant work at the coal-fired-in-flow-facility cfiff at university of tennessee space institute this program combined four parts initial prototypes at the cdif were operated for short durations with various coals montana rosebud and a high-sulphur corrosive coal illinois no 6 a great deal of engineering chemistry and material science was completed after final components were developed operational testing completed with 4,000 hours of continuous operation 2,000 on montana rosebud 2,000 on illinois no 6 the testing ended in 1993 japanese developmentedit the japanese program in the late 1980s concentrated on closed-cycle mhd the belief was that it would have higher efficiencies and smaller equipment especially in the clean small economical plant capacities near 100 megawatts electrical which are suited to japanese conditions open-cycle coal-powered plants are generally thought to become economical above 200 megawatts the first major series of experiments was fuji-1 a blow-down system powered from a shock tube at the tokyo institute of technology these experiments extracted up to 30.2 of enthalpy and achieved power densities near 100 megawatts per cubic meter this facility was funded by tokyo electric power other japanese utilities and the department of education some authorities believe this system was a disc generator with a helium and argon carrier gas and potassium ionization seed in 1994 there were detailed plans for fuji-2 a 5mw electrical continuous closed-cycle facility powered by natural gas to be built using the experience of fuji-1 the basic mhd design was to be a system with inert gases using a disk generator the aim was an enthalpy extraction of 30 and an mhd thermal efficiency of 60 fuji-2 was to be followed by a retrofit to a 300 mwe natural gas plant australian developmentedit in 1986 professor hugo karl messerle at the university of sydney researched coal-fueled mhd this resulted in a 28 mwe topping facility that was operated outside sydney messerle also wrote one of the most recent reference works see below as part of a unesco education program a detailed obituary for hugo is located on the australian academy of technological sciences and engineering atse website 4 italian developmentedit the italian program began in 1989 with a budget of about 20 million us and had three main development areas chinese developmentedit a joint us-china national programme ended in 1992 by retrofitting the coal-fired no 3 plant in asbach a further eleven-year program was approved in march 1994 this established centres of research in the 1994 study proposed a 10 mw electrical 108 mw thermal generator with the mhd and bottoming cycle plants connected by steam piping so either could operate independently russian developmentsedit in 1971 the natural-gas fired u-25 plant was completed near moscow with a designed capacity of 25 megawatts  by 1974 it delivered 6 megawatts of power 5 by 1994 russia had developed and operated the coal-operated facility u-25 at the high-temperature institute of the russian academy of science in moscow u-25s bottoming plant was actually operated under contract with the moscow utility and fed power into moscows grid there was substantial interest in russia in developing a
