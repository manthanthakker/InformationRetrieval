annual fuel utilization efficiency the annual fuel utilization efficiency afue pronounced a-few or a-f-u-e is a thermal efficiency measure of combustion equipment like furnaces boilers and water heaters the afue differs from the true thermal efficiency in that it is not a steady-state peak measure of conversion efficiency but instead attempts to represent the actual season-long average efficiency of that piece of equipment including the operating transients 1 it is a dimensionless ratio of useful energy output to energy input expressed as a percentage for example a 90 afue for a gas furnace means it outputs 90 btus of useful heating for every 100 btus of natural gas input where the rest may be wasted heat in the exhaust a higher afue means higher efficiency the method for determining the afue for residential furnaces is the subject of ashrae standard 103 a furnace with a thermal efficiency Î·th of 78 may yield an afue of only 64 or so for example under the standards test conditions when estimating annual or seasonal energy used by combustion devices the afue is the better efficiency measure to use in the calculations 2 but for an instantaneous fuel consumption rate the thermal efficiency may be better note that the theoretical limit for a conventional furnaces instantaneous efficiency is 100 whereas a heat pump used for building heating may exceed 100 for example a cop of 1.5 is equivalent to 150 heat pumps are readily available for electric and gas sources 3 so from a theoretical perspective in some use cases the name efficiency may be misleading see alsoedit coefficient of performance cop energy efficiency ratio eer seasonal energy efficiency ratio seer ashrae referencesedit  v t e
