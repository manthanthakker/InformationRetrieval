utrecht nl the lease of the round 2 wind farm site at sheringham shoal 1 econventures together with slp energy lowestoft uk formed a joint venture scira offshore energy to develop a c 315mw wind farm development work for econventures was to be carried out by evelop bv both subsidiaries of econcern bv 2 in 2005 hydro took a 50 stake in scira acquiring 25 shareholdings from both slp energy and ecocentures 3 in 2006 scira submitted a planning application to the department of trade and industry for a 108 turbine 315 mw wind farm 4 the planned wind farm was approximately 18 kilometres  11mi off the coast of norfolk at sheringham just within the 12nm uk territorial water boundary and 5 kilometres  3.1mi north of the sand bank known as sheringham shoal the wind farm would be located at water depths of 16 to 22 metres  52 to 72ft and consist of somewhere between 45 and 108 turbines benefits of the site included low shipping and trawling intensities lack of any dredging dumping oilgas or mod practice areas and of cables or pipelines as well as low visual impact from the coast and outside any nature conservation areas 5 the seabed at the windfarm and offshore cable route consisted of mainly gravely sand overlying chalk 6 the electrical power export cable was to be connected to a switching station near muckleburgh collection via landfall near weybourne hope 7 two routes were considered for the export cable one avoiding the sand bank atsheringham shoal 8 the connection to the national grid was planned to be made at an electrical substation near salle norfolk via a 132kv 21.3 kilometres  13.2mi underground cable 9 planning consent for the wind farm was given on 8 august 2008 10 in 2009 statkraft acquired 50 of the shareholding in scira becoming joint  50:50 owners of the development 11 in 2014 the green investment bank took a £240 million 20 stake in the wind farm 12 the lease on the sea bed given by the crown estate has a duration of 50 years and the initial wind farm has an estimated lifespan of 20 years the 2004 energy act requires the developer to decommission the wind farm once out of use - the decommissioning plan submitted by the developer included removal of wind turbines cutting of foundations at seabed level or lower whilst interarray cables would be left on the sea bed 13 constructionedit in april 2008 nexans was awarded a €24m contract for the supply and construction of the 145kv export cables 14 and was awarded a €12m $15.8m contract in april 2009 to supply 81km of 36kv inter-array cables 15 areva obtained a €50 million contract to supply offshore and onshore substations in late 2008 16 17 design and project management of the offshore substations was sub-contracted to wood group 18 design work on the turbine and substation foundations was contracted to ramboll 19 the two foundations for the substations and foundations for 88 turbines were supplied by mt højgaard 20 manufacture of the turbine monopiles and transition pieces was subcontracted to sif group and smulders 21 the substation superstructure and foundations were subcontracted to heerema topside bladt industries transition pieces and sif group and smulders piles 22 in 2009 siemens obtained a €450 million contract to supply 88 wind turbines to the wind farm 23 onshore work began in 2009 24 and construction of the offshore part began march 2010 25 26 turbine foundations installation begain in june 2010 27 mt højgaard installed the substation piles and 17 of the turbine foundations using the vessel svanen halting installation due to a previously scheduled contract for the installation vessel 20 the foundations installed by mt højgaard used a special method the support of the foundation on the delivery barge had its motion steadied by a 135t sliding support with hydraulic motors compensating for wave oscillations 28 29 delays of several months of the arrival of foundation transport vessels coupled with wave conditions limiting the operational window of use of the transport vessels meant that the vessel svanen was not able to install all the foundations the delay had an estimated additional cost of 600million nokcitation needed export cable installation began late 2010 under contract to visser  smith marine contracting work was carried out by the ships atlantic guardian route clearance team oman laying and vos sympathy trenching 30 the offshore substations were installed in may 2011 by heerema 31 the remaining pile foundations and the transition pieces and offshore substation topsides where installed by seaway heavy lifting between may and aug 2011 using the newly built oleg strashnov 32 33 a previous contract with master marine for the substation installation was cancelled and transferred to seaway due to the delays 34 foundation and transition piece installation was complete by aug 2011 32 35 inter-array cables were laid by team oman and installed under the sea bed by water jetting by toisa warrior installation was complete by mar 2012 36 37 the turbine installation was contracted to gulf marine services in dec 2010 the initial contract with master marine was terminated by mutual agreement after the foundation installation delays 38 turbine installation was carried out by the jackup vessels sea jackand gms endeavour with sea jack replaced by sea jack leviathan in late 2011 36 39 the first turbine was installed on 3 july 2011 40 and began generating in aug 2011 41 installation was complete by july 2012 42 operations basesedit as part of the development the harbour and channel at wells harbour was dredged to allow wind farm maintenance vessels to be based there a 150 metres  490ft pontoon jetty was also built the work was completed early 2010 43 44 45 an onshore operations base was constructed at egmere 3 miles south of wells-next-the-sea with building work taking place in 2012 46 47 48 operationedit the wind farm was operational by late 2011 49 an official opening took place on september 27 2012 attended by norways crown prince haakon and uk secretary of state edward davey 50 51 the cost of development has been estimated at 10billion norwegian krona $1.8 billion 52 wells harbour is used as the operational base for the wind farm 52 in june 2013 a consortium blue transmission macquarie capital group barclays infrastructure funds acquired the electrical transmission assets of the wind farm for £193 million 53 in aug 2013 statkraft took over operations and maintenance of the windfarm from scira 54 statoil takes over operation from statkraft beginning in 2017 while also increasing its share in the proposed dogger bank wind farm 55 by sep 2013 the wind farm had generated 1.2twh in its first year of operation 56 see alsoedit wind power in the united kingdom list
