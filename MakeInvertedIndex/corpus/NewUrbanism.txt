new urbanism new urbanism is an urban design movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating walkable neighborhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types 1 it arose in the united states in the early 1980s and has gradually influenced many aspects of real estate development urban planning and municipal land-use strategies new urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to world war ii it encompasses ten basic principles such as traditional neighborhood design tnd and transit-oriented development tod 2 these ideas can all be circled back to two concepts building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices 3 the organizing body for new urbanism is the congress for the new urbanism founded in 1993 its foundational text is the charter of the new urbanism which begins we advocate the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the following principles neighborhoods should be diverse in use and population communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car cities and towns should be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions urban places should be framed by architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history climate ecology and building practice 4 new urbanists support regional planning for open space context-appropriate architecture and planning adequate provision of infrastructure such as sporting facilities libraries and community centres 5 and the balanced development of jobs and housing they believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the population to ride bikes walk or take the train they also hope that this set up will increase the supply of affordable housing and rein in suburban sprawl the charter of the new urbanism also covers issues such as historic preservation safe streets green building and the re-development of brownfield land the ten principles of intelligent urbanism also phrase guidelines for new urbanist approaches architecturally new urbanist developments are often accompanied by new classical postmodern or vernacular styles although that is not always the case  contents 1 background 2 defining elements 3 terminology 4 organizations 5 film 6 criticism 7

were generally organized into and developed around mixed-use walkable neighborhoods for most of human history this meant a city that was entirely walkable although with the development of mass transit the reach of the city extended outward along transit lines allowing for the growth of new pedestrian communities such as streetcar suburbs but with the advent of cheap automobiles and favorable government policies attention began to shift away from cities and towards ways of growth more focused on the needs of the car 6 specifically after world war ii urban planning largely centered around the use of municipal zoning ordinances to segregate residential from commercial and industrial development and focused on the construction of low-density single-family detached houses as the preferred housing format for the growing middle class the physical separation of where people live from where they work shop and frequently spend their recreational time together with low housing density which often drastically reduced population density relative to historical norms made automobiles indispensable for practical transportation and contributed to the emergence of a culture of automobile dependency this new system of development with its rigorous separation of uses arose after world war ii and became known as conventional suburban development 7 or pejoratively as urban sprawl the majority of us citizens now live in suburban communities built in the last fifty years and automobile use per capita has soared although new urbanism as an organized movement would only arise later a number of activists and thinkers soon began to criticize the modernist planning techniques being put into practice social philosopher and historian lewis mumford criticized the anti-urban development of post-war america the death and life of great american cities written by jane jacobs in the early 1960s called for planners to reconsider the single-use housing projects large car-dependent thoroughfares and segregated commercial centers that had become the norm the french architect françois spoerry has developed in the 60 the concept of soft architecture that he applied to port grimaud a new marina in south of france the success of this project will have a considerable influence and will lead to many new projects of soft architecture like port liberté in new jersey or le plessis robisson in france rooted in these early dissenters the ideas behind new urbanism began to solidify in the 1970s and 80s with the urban visions and theoretical models for the reconstruction of the european city proposed by architect leon krier and the pattern language theories of christopher alexander the term new urbanism itself started being used in this context in the mid-1980s 8 9 but it wasnt until the early 1990s that it was commonly written as a proper noun capitalized 10 in 1991 the local government commission a private nonprofit group in sacramento california invited architects peter calthorpe michael corbett andrés duany elizabeth moule elizabeth plater-zyberk stefanos polyzoides and daniel solomon to develop a set of community principles for land use planning named the ahwahnee principles after yosemite national parks ahwahnee hotel the commission presented the principles to about one hundred government officials in the fall of 1991 at its first yosemite conference for local elected officials 11 calthorpe duany moule plater-zyberk polyzoides and solomon founded the chicago-based congress for the new urbanism in 1993 the cnu has grown to more than three thousand members and is the leading international organization promoting new urbanist design principles it holds annual congresses in various us cities in 2009 co-founders elizabeth moule hank dittmar and stefanos polyzoides authored the canons of sustainable architecture and urbanism to clarify and detail the relationship between new urbanism and sustainability the canons are a set of operating principles for human settlement that reestablish the relationship between the art of building the making of community and the conservation of our natural world they promote the use of passive heating and cooling solutions the use of locally obtained materials and in general a culture of permanence  12 new urbanism is a broad movement that spans a number of different disciplines and geographic scales and while the conventional approach to growth remains dominant new urbanist principles have become increasingly influential in the fields of planning architecture and public policy 13 defining elementsedit andrés duany and elizabeth plater-zyberk two of the founders of the congress for the new urbanism observed mixed-use streetscapes with corner shops front porches and a diversity of well-crafted housing while living in one of the victorian neighborhoods of new haven connecticut they and their colleagues observed patterns including the following the neighborhood has a discernible center this is often a square or a green and sometimes a busy or memorable street corner a transit stop would be located at this center most of the dwellings are within a five-minute walk of the center an average of roughly 0.25 miles  0.40km there are a variety of dwelling types  usually houses rowhouses and apartments  so that younger and older people singles and families the poor and the wealthy may find places to live at the edge of the neighborhood there are shops and offices of sufficiently varied types to supply the weekly needs of a household a small ancillary building or garage apartment is permitted within the backyard of each house it may be used as a rental unit or place to work for example an office or craft workshop an elementary school is close enough so that most children can walk from their home there are small playgrounds accessible to every dwelling  not more than a tenth of a mile away streets within the neighborhood form a connected network which disperses traffic by providing a variety of pedestrian and vehicular routes to any destination the streets are relatively narrow and shaded by rows of trees this slows traffic creating an environment suitable for pedestrians and bicycles buildings in the neighborhood center are placed close to the street creating a well-defined outdoor room parking lots and garage doors rarely front the street parking is relegated to the rear of buildings usually accessed by alleys certain prominent sites at the termination of street vistas or in the neighborhood center are reserved for civic buildings these provide sites for community meetings education and religious or cultural activities terminologyedit several terms are viewed either as synonymous included in or overlapping with the new urbanism the terms neotraditional development 14 or traditional neighborhood development are often associated with the new urbanism these terms generally refer to complete new towns or new neighborhoods often built in traditional architectural styles as opposed to smaller infill and redevelopment projects the term traditional urbanism has also been used to describe the new urbanism by those who object to the new moniker the term walkable urbanism was proposed as an alternative term by developer and professor christopher leinberger 15 many debate whether smart growth and the new urbanism are the same or whether substantive differences exist between the two overlap exists in membership and content between the two movements placemaking is another term that is often used to signify new urbanist efforts or those of like-minded groups the term transit-oriented development is sometimes cited as being coined by prominent new urbanist peter calthorpe 16 and is heavily promoted by new urbanists the term sustainable development is sometimes associated with the new urbanism as there has been an increasing focus on the environmental benefits of new urbanism associated with the rise of the term sustainability in the 2000s however this has caused some confusion as the term is also used by the united nations and agenda 21 to include human development issues eg developing country that exceed the scope of land development intended to be addressed by the new urbanism or sustainable urbanism the term livability or livable communities has also become popular under us president barack obamas administration 17 though it dates back at least to the mid-1990s when the term was used by the local government commission 18 planning magazine discussed the proliferation of urbanisms in an article in 2011 titled a short guide to 60 of the newest urbanisms  19 several new urbanists have popularized terminology under the umbrella of the new urbanism including sustainable urbanism and tactical urbanism 20 of which guerrilla urbanism can be viewed as a subset the term tactical urbanism was coined by frenchman michel de certau in 1968 and revived in 2011 by new urbanist mike lydon and the co-authors of the tactical urbanism guide 21 in 2011 andres duany authored a book that used the term agrarian urbanism to describe an agriculturally-focused subset of new urbanist town design 22 in 2013 a group of new urbanists led by cnu co-founder andres duany began a research project under the banner of lean urbanism 23 which purported to provide a bridge between tactical urbanism and the new urbanism other terms have surfaced in reaction to the new urbanism intended to provide a contrast alternative to or a refinement of the new urbanism some of these terms include everyday urbanism by harvard professor margaret crawford john chase and john kaliski 24 ecological urbanism and true urbanism by architect bernard zyscovich landscape urbanism was popularized by charles waldheim who explicitly defined it as in opposition to the new urbanism in his lectures at harvard university 25 a book called landscape urbanism and its discontents edited by andres duany and emily talen specifically addressed the tension between these two views of urbanism 26 michael e arth promotes what he describes as a variant of the new urbanism called the new pedestrianism which is intended to be a more pedestrian-oriented and traces its origins to a 1929 planned community in radburn new jersey 27 organizationsedit the primary organization promoting the new urbanism in the united states is the congress for the new urbanism cnu the congress for the new urbanism cnu is the leading organization promoting walkable mixed-use neighborhood development sustainable communities and healthier living conditions cnu members promote the principles of cnus charter and the hallmarks of new urbanism including livable streets arranged in compact walkable blocks a range of housing choices to serve people of diverse ages and income levels schools stores and other nearby destinations reachable by walking bicycling or transit service an affirming human-scaled public realm where appropriately designed buildings define and enliven streets and other public spaces the cnu has met annually since 1993 when they held their first general meeting in alexandria virginia with approximately one hundred attendees by 2008 the congress was drawing two to three thousand attendees to the annual meetings the cnu began forming local and regional chapters circa 2004 with the founding of the new england and florida chapters 28 by 2011 there were 16 official chapters and interest groups for 7 more as of 2013update canada hosts two full cnu chapters one in ontario cnu ontario and one in british columbia cascadia which also includes a portion of the north-west us states while the cnu has international participation in canada sister organizations have been formed in other areas of the world including the council for european urbanism ceu 29 the movement for israeli urbanism miu and the australian council for the new urbanism by 2002 chapters of students for the new urbanism began appearing at universities including the savannah college of art and design university of georgia university of notre dame and the university of miami in 2003 a group of younger professionals and students met at the 11th congress in washington dc and began developing a manifesto of the next generation of new urbanists the next generation of new urbanists held their first major session the following year at the 12th meeting of the cnu in chicago in 2004 the group has continued meeting annually as of 2014update with a focus on young professionals students new member issues and ensuring the flow of fresh ideas and diverse viewpoints within the new urbanism and the cnu spinoff projects of the next generation of the new urbanists include the living urbanism publication first published in 2008 and the first tactical urbanism guide 30 the cnu has spawned publications and research groups publications include the new urban news and the new town paper research groups have formed independent nonprofits to research individual topics such as the form-based codes institute the national charrette institute and the center for applied transect studies in the united kingdom new urbanist and european urbanism principles are practised and taught by the the princes foundation for the built environment other organisations promote new urbanism as part of their remit such as intbau a vision of europe and others the cnu and other national organizations have also formed partnerships with like-minded groups organizations under the banner of smart growth also often work with the congress for the new urbanism in addition the cnu has formed partnerships on specific projects such as working with the united states green building council and the natural resources defense council to develop the leed for neighborhood development standards 1 and with the institute of transportation engineers to develop a context sensitive solutions css design manual filmedit the new

also gives a brief history of new urbanism and chronicles the rebuilding of an inner city slum into a model of new pedestrianism and new urbanism called the garden district 35 36 criticismedit new urbanism has drawn both praise and criticism from all parts of the political spectrum 37 it has been criticized both for being a social engineering scheme and for failing to address social equity and for both restricting private enterprise and for being a deregulatory force in support of private sector developers in an interview in reason a right-libertarian magazine professor peter gordon a professor of urban planning from university of southern california spoke in favor of suburbanization stating that the new urbanism ignores consumer preference the free market and that cities have moved towards car-oriented development because that is what people want 38 on the other hand journalist alex marshall has decried new urbanism as essentially a marketing scheme that repackages conventional suburban sprawl behind a façade of nostalgic imagery and empty aspirational slogans 39 in a 1996 article in metropolis magazine marshall denounced new urbanism as a grand fraud 40 the attack continued in numerous articles including an opinion column in the washington post in september of the same year 41 and in marshalls first book how cities work suburbs sprawl and the roads not taken 42 critics have asserted that the effectiveness claimed for the new urbanist solution of mixed income developments lacks statistical evidence 43 independent studies have supported the idea of addressing poverty through mixed-income developments 44 45 but the argument that new urbanism produces such diversity has been challenged from findings from one community in canada 46 some parties have criticized the new urbanism for being too accommodating of motor vehicles and not going far enough to promote walking cycling and public transport the charter of the new urbanism states that communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car 4 some critics suggest that communities should exclude the car altogether in favor of car-free developments michael e arth proposes new pedestrianism as a way to further elevate the status of pedestrians by focusing on pedestrian-only paths steve melia proposes the idea of filtered permeability see permeability spatial and transport planning which increases the connectivity of the pedestrian and cycling network resulting in a time and convenience advantage over drivers while still limited the connectivity of the vehicular network and thus maintaining the safety benefits of cul de sacs and horseshoe loops in resistance to property crime 47 in response to critiques of a lack of evidence for the new urbanisms claimed environmental benefits a rating system for neighborhood environmental design leed-nd was developed by the us green building council natural resources defense council and the congress for the new urbanism 48 to quantify the sustainability of new urbanist neighborhood design 1 49 new urbanist and board member of cnu doug farr has taken a step further and coined sustainable urbanism which combines new urbanism and leed-nd to create walkable transit-served urbanism with high performance buildings and infrastructure new urbanism has been criticized for being a form of centrally planned large-scale development instead of allowing the initiative for construction to be taken by the final users themselves 50 it has been criticized for asserting universal principles of design instead of attending to local conditions 1 51 examplesedit united statesedit new urbanism is having a growing influence on how and where metropolitan regions choose to grow at least fourteen

new urbanism is closely related to the urban village movement in europe they both occurred at similar times and share many of the same principles although urban villages has an emphasis on traditional city planning in europe many brown-field sites have been redeveloped since the 1980s following the models of the traditional city neighbourhoods rather than modernist models one well-publicized example is poundbury in england a suburban extension to the town of dorchester which was built on land owned by the duchy of cornwall under the overview of prince charles the original masterplan was designed by leon krier a report carried out after the first phase of construction found a high degree of satisfaction by residents although the aspirations to reduce car dependency had not been successful rising house prices and a perceived premium have made the open market housing unaffordable for many local people 69 the council for european urbanism ceu formed in 2003 shares many of the
