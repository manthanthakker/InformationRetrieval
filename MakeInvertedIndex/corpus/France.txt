still named today francia in italian and spanish frankreich in german and frankrijk in dutch all of which have the same historical meaning there are various theories as to the origin of the name frank following the precedents of edward gibbon and jacob grimm 20 the name of the franks has been linked with the word frank free in english 21 it has been suggested that the meaning of free was adopted because after the conquest of gaul only franks were free of taxation 22 another theory is that it is derived from the proto-germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the franks was known as a francisca 23 however it has been determined that these weapons were named because of their use by the franks not the other way around 24 history prehistory before the 6th century bc the oldest traces of human life in what is now france date from approximately 1.8 million years ago 25 humans were then confronted by a harsh and variable climate marked by several glacial eras early homonids led a nomadic hunter-gatherer life 25 france has a large number of decorated caves from the upper palaeolithic era including one of the most famous and best preserved lascaux 25 approximately 18,000 bc at the end of the last glacial period  10,000 bc the climate became milder 25 from approximately 7,000 bc this part of western europe entered the neolithic era and its inhabitants became sedentary after strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium initially working gold copper and bronze and later iron 26 france has numerous megalithic sites from the neolithic period including the exceptionally dense carnac stones site approximately 3,300 bc antiquity  6th century bc–5th century ad in 600 bc ionian greeks originating from phocaea founded the colony of massalia present-day marseille on the shores of the mediterranean sea this makes it frances oldest city 27 28 at the same time some gallic celtic tribes penetrated parts of the current territory of france and this occupation spread to the rest of france between the 5th and 3rd century bc 29 the concept of gaul emerged at that time it corresponds to the territories of celtic settlement ranging between the rhine the atlantic ocean the pyrenees and the mediterranean the borders of modern france are roughly the same as those of ancient gaul which was inhabited by celtic gauls gaul was then a prosperous country of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to greek and roman cultural and economic influences around 390 bc the gallic chieftain brennus and his troops made their way to italy through the alps defeated the romans in the battle of the allia and besieged and ransomed rome the gallic invasion left rome weakened and the gauls continued to harass the region until 345 bc when they entered into a formal peace treaty with rome but the romans and the gauls would remain adversaries for the next several centuries and the gauls would continue to be a threat in italia around 125 bc the south of gaul was conquered by the romans who called this region provincia nostra our province which over time evolved into the name provence in french 30 julius caesar conquered the remainder of gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the gallic chieftain vercingetorix in 52 bc 31 gaul was divided by augustus into roman provinces 32 many cities were founded during the gallo-roman period including lugdunum present-day lyon which is considered the capital of the gauls 32 these cities were built in traditional roman style with a forum a theatre a circus an amphitheatre and thermal baths the gauls mixed with roman settlers and eventually adopted roman culture and roman speech latin from which the french language evolved the roman polytheism merged with the gallic paganism into the same syncretism from the 250s to the 280s ad roman gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians 33 nevertheless the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century which was a period of revival and prosperity for roman gaul 34 in 312 the emperor constantin i converted to christianity subsequently christians who had been persecuted until then increased rapidly across the entire roman empire 35 but from the beginning of the 5th century the barbarian invasions resumed 36 and germanic tribes such as the vandals suebi and alans crossed the rhine and settled in gaul spain and other parts of the collapsing roman empire 37 early middle ages  5th century–10th century at the end of the antiquity period ancient gaul was divided into several germanic kingdoms and a remaining gallo-roman territory known as the kingdom of syagrius simultaneously celtic britons fleeing the anglo-saxon settlement of britain settled the western part of armorica as a result the armorican peninsula was renamed brittany celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region the pagan franks from whom the ancient name of francie was derived originally settled the north part of gaul but under clovis i conquered most of the other kingdoms in northern and central gaul in 498 clovis i was the first germanic conqueror after the fall of the roman empire to convert to catholic christianity rather than arianism thus france was given the title eldest daughter of the church french la fille aînée de léglise by the papacy 38 and french kings would be called the most christian kings of france rex christianissimus the franks embraced the christian gallo-roman culture and ancient gaul was eventually renamed francia land of the franks the germanic franks adopted romanic languages except in northern gaul where roman settlements were less dense and where germanic languages emerged clovis made paris his capital and established the merovingian dynasty but his kingdom would not survive his death the franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs so four kingdoms emerged from cloviss paris orléans soissons and rheims the last merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace head of household one mayor of the palace charles martel defeated an islamic invasion of gaul at the battle of tours  732 and earned respect and power within the frankish kingdoms his son pepin the short seized the crown of francia from the weakened merovingians and founded the carolingian dynasty pepins son charlemagne reunited the frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across western and central europe proclaimed holy roman emperor by pope leo iii and thus establishing in earnest the french governments longtime historical association with the catholic church 39 charlemagne tried to revive the western roman empire and its cultural grandeur charlemagnes son louis i emperor 814–840 kept the empire united however this carolingian empire would not survive his death in 843 under the treaty of verdun the empire was divided between louis three sons with east francia going to louis the german middle francia to lothair i and west francia to charles the bald west francia approximated the area occupied by and was the precursor to modern france 40 during the 9th and 10th centuries continually threatened by viking invasions france became a very decentralised state the nobilitys titles and lands became hereditary and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen thus was established feudalism in france over time some of the kings vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king for example after the battle of hastings in 1066 william the conqueror added king of england to his titles becoming both the vassal to as duke of normandy and the equal of as king of england the king of france creating recurring tensions late middle ages  10th century–15th century the carolingian dynasty ruled france until 987 when hugh capet duke of france and count of paris was crowned king of the franks 41 his descendantsthe capetians the house of valois and the house of bourbonprogressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the kingdom of france which was fully declared in 1190 by philip ii augustus the french nobility played a prominent role in most crusades in order to restore christian access to the holy land french knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the crusades in such a fashion that the arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as franj caring little whether they really came from france 42 the french crusaders also imported the french language into the levant making french the base of the lingua franca litt frankish language of the crusader states 42 french knights also comprised the majority in both the hospital and the temple orders the latter in particular held numerous properties throughout france and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the french crown until philip iv annihilated the order in 1307 the albigensian crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day france in the end the cathars were exterminated and the autonomous county of toulouse was annexed into the kingdom of france 43 later kings expanded their domain to cover over half of modern continental france including most of the north centre and west of france meanwhile the royal authority became more and more assertive centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility clergy and commoners charles iv the fair died without an heir in 1328 44 under the rules of the salic law the crown of france could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line 44 accordingly the crown passed to philip of valois a cousin of charles rather than through the female line to charles nephew edward who would soon become edward iii of england during the reign of philip of valois the french monarchy reached the height of its medieval power 44 philips seat on the throne was contested by edward iii of england and in 1337 on the eve of the first wave of the black death 45 england and france went to war in what would become known as the hundred years war 46 the exact boundaries changed greatly with time but french landholdings of the english kings remained extensive for decades with charismatic leaders such as joan of arc and la hire strong french counterattacks won back english continental territories like the rest of europe france was struck by the black death half of the 17 million population of france died 47 48 early modern period  15th century–1789 the french renaissance saw a spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the french language which would become the official language of france and the language of europes aristocracy it also saw a long set of wars known as the italian wars between the kingdom of france and the powerful holy roman empire french explorers such as jacques cartier or samuel de champlain claimed lands in the americas for france paving the way for the expansion of the first french colonial empire the rise of protestantism in europe led france to a civil war known as the french wars of religion where in the most notorious incident thousands of huguenots were murdered in the st bartholomews day massacre of 1572 49 the wars of religion were ended by henry ivs edict of nantes which granted some freedom of religion to the huguenots under louis xiii the energetic cardinal richelieu reinforced the centralisation of the state royal power and french dominance in europe foreshadowing the reign of louis xiv during louis xivs minority and the regency of queen anne and cardinal mazarin a period of trouble known as the fronde occurred in france which was at that time at war with spain this rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal power in france the monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of louis xiv by turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the palace of versailles louis xivs personal power became unchallenged remembered for his numerous wars he made france the leading european power france became the most populous country in europe and had tremendous influence over european politics economy and culture french became the most-used language in diplomacy science literature and international affairs and remained so until the 20th century 50 france obtained many overseas possessions in the americas africa and asia louis xiv also revoked the edict of nantes forcing thousands of huguenots into exile under louis xv louis xivs grandson france lost new france and most of its indian possessions after its defeat in the seven years war which ended in 1763 its european territory kept growing however with notable acquisitions such as lorraine  1766 and corsica  1770 an unpopular king louis xvs weak rule his ill-advised financial political and military decisions  as well as the debauchery of his court discredited the monarchy and arguably led to the french revolution 15 years after his death 51 52 louis xvi louis xvs grandson actively supported the americans who were seeking their independence from great britain realised in the treaty of paris  1783 the financial crisis that followed frances involvement in the american revolutionary war was one of many contributing factors to the french revolution much of the enlightenment occurred in french intellectual circles and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions such as the discovery of oxygen  1778 and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers  1783 were achieved by french scientists french explorers such as bougainville and lapérouse took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe the enlightenment philosophy in which reason is advocated as the primary source for legitimacy and authority undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the french revolution modern period  1789–1914 facing financial troubles louis xvi summoned the estates-general gathering the three estates of the realm in may 1789 to propose solutions to his government as it came to an impasse the representatives of the third estate formed into a national assembly signalling the outbreak of the french revolution fearing that the king would suppress the newly created national assembly insurgents stormed the bastille on 14 july 1789 a date which would become frances national day the absolute monarchy was subsequently replaced by a constitutional monarchy through the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen france established fundamental rights for men the declaration affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of man to liberty property security and resistance to oppression freedom of speech and press were declared and arbitrary arrests outlawed it called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth while louis xvi as a constitutional king enjoyed popularity among the population his disastrous flight to varennes seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion his credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility european monarchies gathered against the new régime to restore the french absolute monarchy the foreign threat exacerbated frances political turmoil and deepened the sense of urgency among the various factions and war was declared against austria on 20 april 1792 mob violence occurred during the insurrection of 10 august 1792 53 and the following month 54 as a result of this violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy the republic was proclaimed on 22 september 1792 louis xvi was convicted of treason and guillotined in 1793 facing increasing pressure from european monarchies internal guerrilla wars and counterrevolutions such as the war in the vendée or the chouannerie the young republic fell into the reign of terror between 1793 and 1794 between 16,000 and 40,000 people were executed in western france the civil war between the bleus blues supporters of the revolution and the blancs whites supporters of the monarchy lasted from 1793 to 1796 and led to the loss of between 200,000 and 450,000 lives 55 56 both foreign armies and french counter-revolutionaries were crushed and the french republic survived furthermore it extended greatly its boundaries and established sister republics in the surrounding countries as the threat of a foreign invasion receded and france became mostly pacified the thermidorian reaction put an end to robespierres rule and to the terror the abolition of slavery and male universal suffrage enacted during this radical phase of the revolution were cancelled by subsequent governments after a short-lived governmental scheme napoleon bonaparte seized control of the republic in 1799 becoming first consul and later emperor of the french empire  1804–1814/1815 as a continuation of the wars sparked by the european monarchies against the french republic changing sets of european coalitions declared wars on napoleons empire his armies conquered most of continental europe with swift victories such as the battles of jena-auerstadt or austerlitz he redrew the european political map while members of the bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms 57 these victories led to the worldwide expansion of french revolutionary ideals and reforms such as the metric system the napoleonic code and the declaration of the rights of man after the catastrophic russian campaign and the ensuing uprising of european monarchies against his rule napoleon was defeated and the bourbon monarchy restored about a million frenchmen died during the napoleonic wars 57 after his brief return from exile napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the battle of waterloo the monarchy was re-established  1815–1830 with new constitutional limitations the discredited bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the july revolution of 1830 which established the constitutional july monarchy which lasted until 1848 when the french second republic was proclaimed in the wake of the european revolutions of 1848 the abolition of slavery and male universal suffrage both briefly enacted during the french revolution were re-enacted in 1848 in 1852 the president of the french republic louis-napoléon bonaparte napoleon is nephew was proclaimed emperor of the second empire as napoleon iii he multiplied french interventions abroad especially in crimea in mexico and italy which resulted in the annexation of the duchy of savoy and the county of nice then part of the kingdom of sardinia napoleon iii was unseated following defeat in the franco-prussian war of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the third republic france had colonial possessions in various forms since the beginning of the 17th century but in the 19th and 20th centuries its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the second largest in the world behind the british empire including metropolitan france the total area of land under french sovereignty almost reached 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s 8.6 of the worlds land known as the belle époque the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism regional peace economic prosperity and technological scientific and cultural innovations in 1905 state secularism was officially established contemporary period  1914present france was a member of the triple entente when world war i broke out a small part of northern france was occupied but france and its allies emerged victorious against the central powers at a tremendous human and material cost world war i left 1.4million french soldiers dead 4 of its population 58 between 27 and 30 of soldiers conscripted from 1912–1915 were killed 59 the interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the popular front government annual leave eight-hour workdays women in government etc in 1940 france was invaded and occupied by nazi germany metropolitan france was divided into a german occupation zone in the north and vichy france a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with germany in the south while free france the government-in-exile led by charles de gaulle was set up in london 60 from 1942 to 1944 about 160,000 french citizens including around 75,000 jews 61 62 63 were deported to death camps and concentration camps in germany and poland 64 on 6 june 1944 the allies invaded normandy and in august they invaded provence over the following year the allies and the french resistance emerged victorious over the axis powers and french sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the provisional government of the french republic gprf this interim government established by de gaulle aimed to continue to wage war against germany and to purge collaborators from office it also made several important reforms suffrage extended to women creation of a social security system the gprf laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the fourth republic which saw spectacular economic growth les trente glorieuses france was one of the founding members of nato  1949 france attempted to regain control of french indochina but was defeated by the viet minh in 1954 at the climactic battle of dien bien phu only months later france faced another anti-colonialist conflict in algeria torture and illegal executions were perpetrated by both sides and the debate over whether or not to keep control of algeria then home to over one million european settlers 65 wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war 66 in 1958 the weak and unstable fourth republic gave way to the fifth republic which included a strengthened presidency 67 in the latter role charles de gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the war the algerian war was concluded with the évian accords in 1962 that led to algerian independence a vestige of the colonial empire are the french overseas departments and territories in the context of the cold war de gaulle pursued a policy of national independence towards the western and eastern blocs to this end he withdrew from natos military integrated command he launched a nuclear development programme and made france the fourth nuclear power he restored cordial franco-german relations in order to create a european counterweight between the american and soviet spheres of influence however he opposed any development of a supranational europe favouring a europe of sovereign nations in the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968 the revolt of may 1968 had an enormous social impact in france it is considered to be the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal religion patriotism respect for authority shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal secularism individualism sexual revolution although the revolt was a political failure as the gaullist party emerged even stronger than before it announced a split between the french people and de gaulle who resigned shortly after in the post-gaullist era france remained one of the most developed economies in the world but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt in the late 20th and early 21st centuries france has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational european union notably by signing the maastricht treaty which created the european union in 1992 establishing the eurozone in 1999 and signing the lisbon treaty in 2007 68 france has also gradually but fully reintegrated into nato and has since participated in most nato sponsored wars 69 since the 19th century france has received many immigrants these have been mostly male foreign workers from european catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed 70 during the 1970s france faced economic crisis and allowed new immigrants mostly from the maghreb 70 to permanently settle in france with their families and to acquire french citizenship it resulted in hundreds of thousands of muslims especially in the larger cities living in subsidised public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates 71 simultaneously france renounced the assimilation of immigrants where they were expected to adhere to french traditional values and cultural norms they were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integrate 72 since the 1995 paris métro and rer bombings france has been sporadically targeted by islamist organisations notably the charlie hebdo attack in january 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in french history gathering 4.4 million people 73 74 the november 2015 paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths the deadliest attack on french soil since world war ii 75 76 and the deadliest in the european union since the madrid train bombings in 2004 77 and the 2016 nice attack which caused 87 deaths during bastille day celebrations geography location and borders the european part of france is called metropolitan france and it is located in one of the occidental ends of europe it is bordered by the north sea in the north the english channel in the north-west the atlantic ocean in the west and the mediterranean sea in the south-east it borders belgium and luxembourg in the north east it also borders germany and switzerland in the east italy and monaco in the south-east spain and andorra in the south west the borders in the south and in the east of the country are mountain ranges the pyrenees the alps and the jura the border in the east is from the rhine river while the border in the north and the north east melts in no natural elements due to its shape it is often referred to in french as lhexagone the hexagon metropolitan france includes various islands corsica and coastal islands metropolitan france is situated mostly between latitudes 41 and 51 n and longitudes 6 w and 10 e on the western edge of europe and thus lies within the northern temperate zone its continental part covers about 1000km from north to south and from east to west france has overseas regions across the world these territories have varying statuses in the territorial administration of france and are located in south america french guiana in the atlantic ocean saint pierre and miquelon and in the antilles guadeloupe martinique saint martin and saint barthélemy in the pacific ocean french polynesia the special collectivity of new caledonia wallis and futuna and clipperton island in the indian ocean réunion island mayotte scattered islands in the indian ocean crozet islands st paul and amsterdam islands in the indian ocean kerguelen islands in the antarctic adélie land france has land borders with brazil and suriname in french guiana and also with the kingdom of the netherlands through the french part of saint martin the european territory of france covers 551,500 square kilometres  212,935sqmi 78 the largest among european union members 18 frances total land area with its overseas departments and territories excluding adélie land is 643,801km2  248,573sqmi 0.45 of the total land area on earth france possesses a wide variety of landscapes from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the alps in the southeast the massif central in the south central and pyrenees in the southwest due to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered on all oceans of the planet france possesses the second-largest exclusive economic zone eez in the world covering 11,035,000km2  4,260,000mi2 just behind the eez of the united states  11,351,000km2  4,383,000mi2 but ahead of the eez of australia  8,148,250km2  4,111,312mi2 its eez covers approximately 8 of the total surface of all the eezs of the world at 4,810.45 metres  15,782ft 79 above sea level the highest point in western europe mont blanc is situated in the alps on the border between france and italy france also has extensive river systems such as the seine the loire the garonne and the rhone which divides the massif central from the alps and flows into the mediterranean sea at the camargue corsica lies off the mediterranean coast climate most of the low-lying areas of metropolitan france excluding corsica are located in the oceanic climate zone cfb cwb and cfc in the köppen classification a small part of the territory bordering the mediterranean basin lies in the csa and csb zones as the french metropolitan territory is relatively large the climate is not uniform giving rise to the following climate nuances the west of france has strictly oceanic climate it extends from flanders to the basque country in a coastal strip several tens of kilometres wide narrower to the north and south but wider in brittany which is almost entirely in this climate zone the climate of the south is also oceanic but warmer the climate of the northwest is oceanic but cooler and windier away from the coast the climate is always oceanic but it characteristics change a little in the paris sedimentary basin and more in the intra mountain basins the seasonal amplitude becomes a little stronger the autumn rains and winter especially are less marked therefore most of the territory has qualified climate gradient semi-oceanic climate this is a transition zone between the strict oceanic climate and continental climate the oceanic degraded climate of plain in the centrenorth sometimes called parisien due tot eh fact that corresponds approximately to the paris basin where the oceanic climate is slightly altered and the semi-continental climate in the north and in the centre-west alsace plains of saône or of middle-rhône plains dauphinoises auvergnates ou savoyardes which features further modified by the neighbouring mountain ranges due to the provision of air masses especially in summer and mountain borders that isolate some of the rest of the country the mediterranean and the lower rhone valley swept by the mistral and tramontana experiencing mediterranean climate the mountain or alpine climate is presented mainly in the alps the pyrenees the massif central the jura and the vosges in the overseas regions there are three broad types of climate a tropical climate in most overseas regions high constant temperature throughout the year with a dry and a wet season an equatorial climate in french guiana high constant temperature throughout the year with even precipitation throughout the year a subpolar climate in saint pierre and miquelon and in most of the french southern and antarctic lands short mild summers and long very cold winters the climate of the south is also oceanic but warmer the climate of the northwest is oceanic but cooler and windier the oceanic degraded climate of plain in the centrenorth sometimes called parisien due tot eh fact that corresponds approximately to the paris basin where the oceanic climate is slightly altered and the semi-continental climate in the north and in the centre-west alsace plains of saône or of middle-rhône plains dauphinoises auvergnates ou savoyardes which features further modified by the neighbouring mountain ranges vineyards in côte de nuits burgundy

one of the first countries to create an environment ministry in 1971 80 although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world france is ranked only 17th by carbon dioxide emissions behind less populous nations such as canada or australia this is due to frances decision to invest in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis 81 which now accounts for 75 of its electricity production 82 and results in less pollution 83 84 like all european union members france agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20 of 1990 levels by the year 2020 85 compared to the us plan to reduce emissions by 4 of 1990 levels 86 as of 2009update french carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of chinas 87 the country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted 88 which would have raised 4billion euros of revenue annually 89 however the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening french businesses 90 forests account for 28 of frances land area 91 92 and are some of the most diverse in europe comprising more than 140 species of trees 93 there are nine national parks 94 and 46 natural parks in france 95 with the government planning to convert 20 of its exclusive economic zone into a marine protected area by 2020 96 a regional nature park 97 french parc naturel régional or pnr is a public establishment in france between local authorities and the french national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty in order to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area 98 a pnr sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation sustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each parks unique landscape and heritage the parks also foster ecological research programmes and public education in the natural sciences 99 as of 2014update there are 49 pnrs in france according to the 2012 environmental performance index conducted by yale and columbia france was the sixth-most environmentally conscious country in the world one place higher than the previous report in 2010 100 101 geology topography and hydrography metropolitan france has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes large parts of the current territory of france were raised during several tectonic episodes like the hercynian uplift in the paleozoic era which is the origin of armorican massif central morvandeau vosges ardennes and corse the alpine pyrenean and jura mountains are themselves much younger and have less eroded forms the alpine peak at 4809 meters above sea level at the mount white although 60 of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks these risks remain moderate these massifs delineate several sedimentary basins including the aquitaine basin in the southwest and the paris basin in the north the last one includes several areas of particularly fertile ground including silt trays of beauce and brie in addition various routes of natural passage such as the rhone valley allow easy communications the coastlines offer contrasting landscapes mountain ranges of benefits the french riviera for example plateaus ending on cliffs the alabaster coast wetlands and forest areas of sologne or wide sandy plains the languedoc plain the river system in france is mainly organised around four major rivers the loire the seine the garonne and the rhône to which can be added the meuse and rhine the latter of lower importance to france but significant to europe in general the french watershed of the first four matches over 62 of the metropolitan territory france has 11 million square kilometres of marine waters under its jurisdiction within three oceans of which 97 are overseas administrative divisions the french republic is divided into 18 regions located in europe and overseas 5 overseas collectivities 1 overseas territory 1 special collectivity new caledonia and 1 uninhabited island directly under the authority of the minister of overseas france clipperton regions france is mainly divided into 18 administrative regions 13 regions in metropolitan france including the territorial collectivity of corsica 102 and five located overseas 78 the regions are further subdivided into 101 departments 103 which are numbered mainly alphabetically this number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle number plates among the 101 departments of france five french guiana guadeloupe martinique mayotte and réunion are in overseas regions roms that are also simultaneously overseas departments doms enjoy exactly the same status as metropolitan departments and are an integral part of the european union the 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements which are in turn subdivided into 2,054 cantons 104 these cantons are then divided into 36,658 communes which are municipalities with an elected municipal council 104 three communesparis lyon and marseilleare subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements the regions departments and communes are all known as territorial collectivities meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions however this was not always the case until 1940 the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly but these were suspended by the vichy regime and definitely abolished by the fourth republic in 1946 105 the 18 regions of france from january 2016 overseas territories and collectivities in addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments the french republic has five overseas collectivities french polynesia saint barthélemy saint martin saint pierre and miquelon and wallis and futuna one sui generis collectivity new caledonia one overseas territory french southern and antarctic lands and one island possession in the pacific ocean clipperton island overseas collectivities and territories form part of the french republic but do not form part of the european union or its fiscal area with the exception of st bartelemy which seceded from guadeloupe in 2007 the pacific collectivities coms of french polynesia wallis and fortuna and new caledonia continue to use the cfp franc 106 whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro in contrast the five overseas regions used the french franc and now use the euro 107 politics government the french republic is a unitary semi-presidential republic with strong democratic traditions 108 the constitution of the fifth republic was approved by referendum on 28 september 1958 109 it greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to parliament the executive branch itself has two leaders the president of the republic currently françois hollande who is head of state and is elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5-year term formerly 7 years 110 and the government led by the president-appointed prime minister currently manuel valls the french parliament is a bicameral legislature comprising a national assembly assemblée nationale and a senate 111 the national assembly deputies represent local constituencies and are directly elected for 5-year terms 112 the assembly has the power to dismiss the government and thus the majority in the assembly determines the choice of government senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms originally 9-year terms and one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years starting in september 2008 113 the senates legislative powers are limited in the event of disagreement between the two chambers the national assembly has the final say 114 the government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of parliament french politics are characterised by two politically opposed groupings one left-wing centred on the french socialist party and the other right-wing centred previously around the rassemblement pour la république rpr then its successor the ump union for a popular movement ump which in 2015 was renamed les républicains 115 since the 2012 elections the executive branch is currently composed mostly of the socialist party law france uses a civil legal system 78 that is law arises primarily from written statutes judges are not to make law but merely to interpret it though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the napoleonic code which was in turn largely based on the royal law codified under louis xiv in agreement with the principles of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society as guy canivet first president of the court of cassation wrote about the management of prisons freedom is the rule and its restriction is the exception any restriction of freedom must be provided for by law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality that is law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy french law is divided into two principal areas private law and public law private law includes in particular civil law and criminal law public law includes in particular administrative law and constitutional law however in practical terms french law comprises three principal areas of law civil law criminal law and administrative law criminal laws can only address the future and not the past criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited 116 while administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries it is completely separated in france and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court ordinary courts which handle criminal and civil litigation are headed by the court of cassation and administrative courts are headed by the council of state to be applicable every law must be officially published in the journal officiel de la république française france does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions france has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws the latter being abolished in 1791 however offences against public decency contraires aux bonnes mœurs or disturbing public order trouble à lordre public have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution since 1999 civil unions for homosexual couples are permitted and since may 2013 same-sex marriage and lgbt adoption are legal in france 117 laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881 some consider however that hate speech laws in france are too broad or severe and damage freedom of speech 118 france has laws against racism and antisemitism 119 since 1990 the gayssot act prohibits holocaust denial frances attitude towards freedom of religion is complex freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitutional rights set forth in the 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen however since the 1905 french law on the separation of the churches and the state the state tries to prevent its policy-making from being influenced by religion and became suspicious in recent decades towards new religious tendencies of the french society the parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995 and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004 in 2010 it banned the wearing of face-covering islamic veils in public as some have complained that they have suffered from discrimination thus and after criticism by human rights groups such as amnesty international and human rights watch 120 121 these laws remain controversial although they are supported by most of the population 122 foreign relations france is a founding member of the united nations and serves as one of the permanent members of the un security council with veto rights 123 in 2015 france was described as being the best networked state in the world because it is a country that is member of more

which it was a founding member since the 1960s france has developed close ties with reunified germany to become the most influential driving force of the eu 131 in the 1960s france sought to exclude the british from the european unification process 132 seeking to build its own standing in continental europe however since 1904 france has maintained an entente cordiale with the united kingdom and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries especially militarily france is a member of the north atlantic treaty organisation nato but under president de gaulle it excluded itself from the joint military command to protest the special relationship between the united states and britain and to preserve the independence of french foreign and security policies 133 france vigorously opposed the 2003 invasion of iraq 134 135 straining bilateral relations with the us 136 137 and the uk 138 however as a result of nicolas sarkozys pro-american politics much criticised in france by the leftists and by a part of the right 139 140 france rejoined the nato joint military command on 4 april 2009 in the early 1990s the country drew considerable criticism from other nations for its underground nuclear tests in french polynesia 141 france retains strong political and economic influence in its former african colonies françafrique 142 and has supplied economic aid and troops for

the early 20th century 234 between 1921 and 1935 alone about 1.1 million net immigrants came to france 235 the next largest wave came in the 1960s when around 1.6million pieds noirs returned to france

romance language derived from latin since 1635 the académie française has been frances official authority on the french language although its recommendations carry no legal power the french government does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals but the use of french is required by law in commercial and workplace communications in addition to mandating the use of french in the territory of the republic the french government tries to promote french in the european union and globally through institutions such as la francophonie the perceived threat from anglicisation has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the french language in france besides french there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of france eight spoken in french metropolitan territory and 69 in the french overseas territories from the 17th to the mid-20th century french served as the pre-eminent international language of diplomacy and international affairs as well as a lingua franca among the educated classes of europe 248 the dominant position of french language in international affairs was overtaken by english since the emergence of the us as a major power 50 249 250 for most of the time in which french served as an international lingua franca it was not the native language of most frenchmen a report in 1794 conducted by henri grégoire found that of the countrys 25 million people only three million spoke french natively the rest spoke one of the countrys many regional languages such as alsatian breton or occitan 251 through the expansion of public education in which french was the sole language of instruction as well as other factors such as increased urbanisation and the rise of mass communication french gradually came to be adopted by virtually the entire population a process not completed until the 20th century as a result of frances extensive colonial ambitions between the 17th and 20th centuries french was introduced to the americas africa polynesia south-east asia and the caribbean french is the second most studied foreign language in the world after english 252 and is a lingua franca in some regions notably in africa the legacy of french as a living language outside europe is mixed it is nearly extinct in some former french colonies the levant south and southeast asia while creoles and pidgins based on french have emerged in the french departments in the west indies and the south pacific french polynesia on the other hand many former french colonies have adopted french as an official language and the total number of french speakers is increasing especially in africa it is estimated that between 300 million 253 and 500 million 254 people worldwide can speak french either as a mother tongue or a second language religion france is a secular country and freedom of religion is a constitutional right french religious policy is based on the concept of laïcité a strict separation of church and state under which public life is kept completely secular catholicism has been the predominant religion in france for more than a millennium though it is not as actively practised today as it was among the 47,000 religious buildings in france 94 are roman catholic 256 while in 1965 81 of the french declared themselves to be catholics in 2009 this proportion was 64 moreover while 27 of the french went to mass once a week or more in 1952 only 5 did so in 2006 257 the same survey found that protestants accounted for 3 of the population an increase from previous surveys and 5 adhered to other religions with the remaining 28 stating they had no religion 257 evangelicalism may be the fastest growing religious category in france 258 during the french revolution activists conducted a brutal campaign of de-christianisation ending the established state status of the catholic church in some cases clergy and churches were attacked with iconoclasm stripping the churches of statues and ornament after the back and forth of catholic royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century france established laïcité by passage of the 1905 law on the separation of the churches and the state 259 according to a survey in january 2007 260 only 5 of the french population attended church regularly among the respondents who identified as catholic 10 attend church services regularly the poll showed 261 that 51 of citizens

muslim background to be between 5 and 6 million  8–10 265 266 according to the pewforum in france proponents of a 2004 law banning the wearing of religious symbols in schools say it protects muslim girls from being forced to wear a headscarf but the law also restricts those who want to wear headscarves or any other conspicuous religious symbol including large christian crosses and sikh turbans as an expression of their faith 267 the current jewish community in france numbers around 600,000 according to the world jewish congress and is the largest in europe it is the third-largest in the world after those in israel and the united states since 1905 the french government has followed the principle of laïcité in which it is prohibited from recognising any specific right to a religious community except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the local law in alsace-moselle it recognises religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine conversely religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policy-making 268 certain groups such as scientology children of god the unification church or the order of the solar temple are considered cults sectes in french 269 and therefore do not have the same status as recognised religions in france secte is considered a pejorative term in france 270 health the french health care system is one of universal health care largely financed by government national health insurance in its 2000 assessment of world health care systems the world health organization found that france provided the close to best overall health care in the world 272 the french healthcare system was ranked first worldwide by the world health organization in 1997 273 274 in 2011 france spent 11.6 of gdp on health care or us$4,086 per capita 275 a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in europe but less than in the us approximately 77 of health expenditures are covered by government funded agencies 276 care is generally free for people affected by chronic diseases affections de longues durées such as cancer aids or cystic fibrosis average life expectancy at birth is 78 years for men and 85 years for women one of the highest of the european union 277 there are 3.22 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants in france 278 and average health care spending per capita was us$4,719 in 2008 279 as of 2007update approximately 140,000 inhabitants  0.4 of france are living with hivaids 78 even if the french have the reputation of being one of the thinnest people in developed countries 280 281 282 283 284 285 francelike other rich countriesfaces an increasing and recent epidemic of obesity due mostly to the replacement in french eating habits of traditional healthy french cuisine by junk food 280 281 286 the french obesity rate is still far below that of the usa for instance obesity rate in france is the same as the us had in the 1970s 281 and is still the lowest of europe 283 286 authorities now regard obesity as one of the main public health issues 287 and fight it fiercely rates of childhood obesity are slowing in france while continuing to grow in other countries 288 education in 1802 napoleon created the lycée 289 nevertheless it is jules ferry who is considered to be the father of the french modern school which is free secular and compulsory until the age of 13 since 1882 290 school attendance in france is now compulsory until the age of 16 291 nowadays the schooling system in france is centralised and is composed of three stages primary education secondary education and higher education the programme for international student assessment coordinated by the oecd currently ranks frances education as the 25th best in the world being neither significantly higher nor lower than the oecd average 292 primary and secondary education are predominantly public run by the ministry of national education in france education is compulsory from six to sixteen years old and the public school is secular and free if training and remuneration of teachers and the choice of programmes are the state spring the management of primary and secondary schools is the responsibility of local authorities primary education is made in two phases the nursery school which welcome very young children has as a main goal their awakening their socialisation and the development of basic tools that are the language and the number then around the age of six children are greeted by elementary school whose primary objectives are learning writing arithmetic and civics secondary education also takes place in two cycles the first is offered to college and leads to the national certificate diplôme national du brevetfr the second is offered in high school and results in national exams and ends the bachelor professional technical or general and the certificate of professional competence capa in agricultural education higher education in france is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective grandes écoles such as sciences po paris for political studies hec paris for economics polytechnique and the école nationale supérieure des mines de paris that produces high-profile engineers or the école nationale dadministration for careers in the great corps of the state the grandes écoles have been criticised for alleged elitism 293 nevertheless they have produced many if not most of frances high-ranking civil servants ceos and politicians since higher education is funded by the state the fees are very low the tuition varies from €150 to €700 depending on the university and the different levels of education licence master doctorate one can therefore get a masters degree in 5 years for about €750–3,500 the tuition in public engineering schools is comparable to universities albeit a little higher around €700 however it can reach €7000 a year for private engineering schools and some business schools which are all private or partially private charge up to €15000 a year health insurance for students is free until the age of 20 culture france has been a centre of western cultural development for centuries many french artists have been among the most renowned of their time and france is still recognised in the world for its rich cultural tradition the successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation and the creation of the ministry of culture in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public the ministry of culture has been very active since its creation granting subsidies to artists promoting french culture in the world supporting festivals and cultural events protecting historical monuments the french government also succeeded in maintaining a cultural exception to defend audiovisual products made in the country france receives the highest number of tourists per year largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory it counts 1,200 museums welcoming more than 50million people annually 294 the most important cultural sites are run by the government for instance through the public agency centre des monuments nationaux which is responsible for approximately 85 national historical monuments the 43,180 buildings protected as historical monuments include mainly residences many castles or châteaux in french and religious buildings cathedrals basilicas churches etc but also statutes memorials and gardens the unesco inscribed 41 sites in france on the world heritage list 295 art the origins of french art were very much influenced by flemish art and by italian art at the time of the renaissance jean fouquet the most famous medieval french painter is said to have been the first to travel to italy and experience the early renaissance at first hand the renaissance painting school of fontainebleau was directly inspired by italian painters such as primaticcio and rosso fiorentino who both worked in france two of the most famous french artists of the time of baroque era nicolas poussin and claude lorrain lived in italy the 17th century was the period when french painting became prominent and individualised itself through classicism louis xivs prime minister jean-baptiste colbert founded in 1648 the royal academy of painting and sculpture to protect these artists and in 1666 he created the still-active french academy in rome to have direct relations with italian artists french artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style the works of the court-endorsed artists antoine watteau françois boucher and jean-honoré fragonard being the most representative in the country the french revolution brought great changes as napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as jacques-louis david and the highly influential académie des beaux-arts defined the style known as academism at this time france had become a centre of artistic creation the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements at first romanticism with théodore géricault and eugène delacroix and realism with camille corot gustave courbet and jean-françois millet a style that eventually evolved into naturalism in the second part of the 19th century frances influence over painting became even more important with the development of new styles of painting such as impressionism and symbolism the most famous impressionist painters of the period were camille pissarro édouard manet edgar degas claude monet and auguste renoir 296 the second generation of impressionist-style painters paul cézanne paul gauguin toulouse-lautrec and georges seurat were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions 297 as well as the fauvist artists henri matisse andré derain and maurice de vlaminck 298 299 at the beginning of the 20th century cubism was developed by georges braque and the spanish painter pablo picasso living in paris other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near paris such as vincent van gogh marc chagall amedeo modigliani and wassily kandinsky many museums in france are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works a huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned musée du louvre such as mona lisa also known as la joconde while the louvre palace has been for a long time a museum the musée dorsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station gare dorsay in a major reorganisation of national art collections to gather french paintings from the second part of the 19th century mainly impressionism and fauvism movements 300 301 modern works are presented in the musée national dart moderne which moved in 1976 to the centre georges pompidou these three state-owned museums welcome close to 17million people a year 302 other national museums hosting paintings include the grand palais  1.3million visitors in 2008 but there are also many museums owned by cities the most visited being the musée dart moderne de la ville de paris  0.8million entries in 2008 which hosts contemporary works 302 outside paris all the large cities have a museum of fine arts with a section dedicated to european and french painting some of the finest collections are in lyon lille rouen dijon rennes and grenoble architecture during the middle ages many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers some french castles that survived are chinon château dangers the massive château de vincennes and the so-called cathar castles during this era france had been using romanesque architecture like most of western europe some of the greatest examples of romanesque churches in france are the saint sernin basilica in toulouse the largest romanesque church in europe 303 and the remains of the cluniac abbey the gothic architecture originally named opus francigenum meaning french work 304 was born in île-de-france and was the first french style of architecture to be copied in all europe 305 northern france is the home of some of the most important gothic cathedrals and basilicas the first of these being the saint denis basilica used as the royal necropolis other important french gothic cathedrals are notre-dame de chartres and notre-dame damiens the kings were crowned in another important gothic church notre-dame de reims 306 aside from churches gothic architecture had been used for many religious palaces the most important one being the palais des papes in avignon the final victory in the hundred years war marked an important stage in the evolution of french architecture it was the time of the french renaissance and several artists from italy were invited to the french court many residential palaces were built in the loire valley such residential castles were the château de chambord the château de chenonceau or the château damboise following the renaissance and the end of the middle ages baroque architecture replaced the traditional gothic style however in france baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one 307 in the secular domain the palace of versailles has many baroque features jules hardouin mansart who designed the extensions to versailles was one of the most influential french architect of the baroque era he is famous for his dome at les invalides 308 some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet french such as the place stanislas in nancy on the military architectural side vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in europe and became an influential military architect as a result imitations of his works can be found all over europe the americas russia and turkey 309 310 after the revolution the republicans favoured neoclassicism although neoclassicism was introduced in france prior to the revolution with such building as the parisian pantheon or the capitole de toulouse built during the first french empire the arc de triomphe and sainte marie-madeleine represent the best example of empire style architecture 312 under napoleon iii a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque palais garnier were built the urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous for example haussmanns renovation of paris the architecture associated to this era is named second empire in english the term being taken from the second french empire at this time there was a strong gothic resurgence across europe and in france the associated architect was eugène viollet-le-duc in the late 19th century gustave eiffel designed many bridges such as garabit viaduct and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time although he is best remembered for the iconic eiffel tower in the 20th century french-swiss architect le corbusier designed several buildings in france more recently french architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles the louvre pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building the most difficult buildings to integrate within french cities are skyscrapers as they are visible from afar for instance in paris since 1977 new buildings had to be under 37 meters  121 feet 313 frances largest financial district is la defense where a significant number of skyscrapers are located 314 other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges an example of the way this has been done is the millau viaduct some famous modern french architects include jean nouvel dominique perrault christian de portzamparc or paul andreu literature the earliest french literature dates from the middle ages when what is now known as modern france did not have a single uniform language there were several languages and dialects and writers used their own spelling and grammar some authors of french mediaeval texts are unknown such as tristan and iseult and lancelot-grail other authors are known for example chrétien de troyes and duke william ix of aquitaine who wrote in occitan much mediaeval french poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the matter of france such as the song of roland and the various chansons de geste the roman de renart written in 1175 by perrout de saint cloude tells the story of the mediaeval character reynard the fox and is another example of early french writing an important 16th-century writer was françois rabelais whose novel gargantua and pantagruel has remained famous and appreciated until now michel de montaigne was the other major figure of the french literature during that century his most famous work essais created the literary genre of the essay 315 french poetry during that century was embodied by pierre de ronsard and joachim du bellay both writers founded the la pléiade literary movement during the 17th century madame de la fayette published anonymously la princesse de clèves a novel that is considered to be one of the very first psychological novels of all times 316 jean de la fontaine is one of the most famous fabulist of that time as he wrote hundreds of fables some being far more famous than others such as the ant and the grasshopper generations of french pupils had to learn his fables that were seen as helping teaching wisdom and common sense to the young people some of his verses have entered the popular language to become proverbscitation needed jean racine whose incredible mastery of the alexandrine and of the french language has been praised for centuries created plays such as phèdre or britannicus he is along with pierre corneille le cid and molière considered as one of the three great dramatists of the frances golden age molière who is deemed to be one of the greatest masters of comedy of the western literature 319 wrote dozens of plays including le misanthrope lavare le malade imaginaire and le bourgeois gentilhomme his plays have been so popular around the world that french language is sometimes dubbed as the language of molière la langue de molière 320 just like english is considered as the language of shakespeare french literature and poetry flourished even more in the 18th and 19th centuries denis diderots best-known works are jacques the fatalist and rameaus nephew he is however best known for being the main redactor of the encyclopédie whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century in fields such as arts sciences languages philosophy and to present them to the people in order to

dante and homer 322 his novel les misérables is widely seen as one of the greatest novel ever written 323 and the hunchback of notre dame has remained immensely popular other major authors of that century include alexandre dumas the three musketeers and the count of monte-cristo jules verne twenty thousand leagues under the sea émile zola les rougon-macquart honoré de balzac la comédie humaine

in the committees history to refuse the prize in 1964 326 philosophy medieval philosophy was dominated by scholasticism until the emergence of humanism in the renaissance modern philosophy began in france in the 17th century with the philosophy of rené descartes blaise pascal and nicolas malebranche descartes revitalised western philosophy which had been declined after the greek and roman eras 327 his meditations on first philosophy changed the primary object of philosophical thought and raised some of the most fundamental problems for foreigners such as spinoza leibniz hume berkeley and kant during the 18th century french philosophers produced one of the most important works of the age of enlightenment in the spirit of the laws baron de montesquieu theorised the principle of separation of powers which has been implemented in all liberal democracies since it was first applied in the united states in the social contract jean-jacques rousseau openly criticised the european divine right monarchies and strongly affirmed the principle of the sovereignty of the people voltaire came to embody the enlightenment with his defence of civil liberties such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion 19th-century french thought was targeted at responding to the social malaise following the french revolution rationalist philosophers such as victor cousin and auguste comte who called for a new social doctrine were opposed by reactionary thinkers such as joseph de maistre louis de bonald and lamennais who blamed the rationalist rejection of traditional order de maistre is considered together with the englishman edmund burke one of the founders of european conservatism while comte is regarded as the founder of positivism and sociology in the early 20th century french spiritualist thinkers such as maine de biran henri bergson and louis lavelle influenced anglo-saxon thought including the americans charles sanders peirce and william james and the englishman alfred north whitehead in the late 20th century partly influenced by german phenomenology and existentialism postmodern philosophy began in france with notable post-structuralist thinkers including jean-françois lyotard jean baudrillard jacques derrida jacques lacan michel foucault and gilles deleuze music france has a long and varied musical history it experienced a golden age in the
