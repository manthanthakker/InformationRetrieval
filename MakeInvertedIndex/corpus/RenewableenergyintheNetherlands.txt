renewable energy in the netherlands despite the historic usage of wind power to drain water and grind grain the netherlands today lags behind most eu countries in the production of energy from renewable sources the leading renewable sources in the country are biomass wind solar and both geothermal and aerothermal power mostly from ground source and air source heat pumps in 2014 the netherlands produced only 5.5 of its total energy from renewables a small rise from 3.7 in 2010 and just 1 in 1990 1 among the eu countries only malta and luxembourg had lower percentages 2 the low take up of renewable energy may be partially explained by the flat and often sub-sea level landscape and subsequent limits to hydropower resources as well as little natural geothermal potentialcitation needed although hydro poor resource countries such as denmark have still managed to make renewables the focus of their energy needs in 2015 dutch wind turbines had a total nameplate capacity of 3,431 mw 3 most of the tiny contribution made to electricity generation by hydroelectricity came from three power plants a large part of the renewable electricity sold in the netherlands comes from norway a country which generates almost all its electricity from hydropower plants in the netherlands household consumers can choose to buy renewable electricity since 2008 the amount of renewable energy used by household users has been increasing rising from 38 in 2008 to 41 by 2009 and up to 44 by mid 2010 4 one area in which the netherlands is a relative leader is in the adoption of electric plug in vehicles in 2015 pev vehicles in the netherlands represented 9.74 of car sales 5 making it the worlds second highest share after norway electric vehicles are able to run on renewable electricity with zero emissions and have the potential to provide grid power storage facilities 6 an interesting source of heat recovery used in the netherlands is sourced from freshly milked milk or warm milk however at 0.3 of total renewable energy production 1  2010 figures this source is not likely to accelerate energy transition in the country warm milk is still not mentioned in the eu renewable energy directive nor in international energy statistics and so is not included is gross final consumption figures it does however provide dutch farmers with plenty of hot water

break down into national targets of 8.7 in the heating and cooling sector 37 in the electricity sector and 10.3 in the transport sector although these figures may be slightly different from those implied by the minimum trajectory path 7 the following table shows the actual results recorded of renewable energy use by sector actual overall renewable energy use grew from 4.3 in 2009 to 5.5 by 2014 the minimum trajectory planned for 2013-2014 was 5.9 and for 2015-2016 7.6 of total energy use the netherlands is regarded as amongst the most likely countries to miss 2020 national renewable energy targets as outlined by the renewable energy directive sourcesedit wind poweredit 2015 was a record year for new wind turbine installations totalling 586 mw bringing the totalled installed capacity to 3,431 mw by year end 180 mw of the new installations were offshore 10 the dutch government has a target of 6,000 mw of onshore wind power by 2020 and 4,450 mw of offshore wind power by 2023 10 in 2010 the netherlands had 1973 wind turbines including 98 in two offshore windfarms flevoland was the leading province for wind energy with groningen second in capacity and productionthe wind capacity installed at end 2010 will in a normal wind year produced 4.1 of electricity when the equivalent value for germany was 9.4 and portugal 14 11 solar poweredit by 2015 year end cumulative installed capacity of solar pv power reached a preliminary estimate of 1.57 gw with 450 mw added in that year alone 12 biomassedit sources of biomass in the netherlands include the biogenic fraction of waste that is burned in waste incineration plants waste wood is also collected for use in the netherlands and other eu countries manure is used to produce biogas and wood pellets are co-fired in electricity plants 590 kton of pellets were imported mostly from the united states of america and around 140 kton from dutch sources contributing 12 to 13 pj of primary energy to co-firing in energy plants in 2013-2014 biofuels are produced in the netherlands for both domestic and export markets 13 rapeseed and corn crops were hardly used in 2014 to produce biofuels in holland with reasons cited being the high price of corn and resistance to using food crops for fuel production rapeseed is used for well over 1 of the imported biofuels biodiesel while corn is used for 11 bioethanol germany was the largest supplier of rape seed in 2014  53 followed by romania  13 for corn the largest supplier in 2014 was ukraine  39 followed by france  24 some maize fodder is fermented for biofuel production in holland 13 the consumption of biofuels for mobile vehicles in the construction and farming sectors are assigned to the heat sector due to statistical definitions biomass produced 76,657 tj of energy for final consumption in 2013 the largest share was destined for the heat sector at 42,886tj followed by the electricity sector at 21 649t j and then the transport sector with 12,123tj warm milkedit in 2010 740,000 dairy cows about half of the countrys total provided 277 tj of heat energy avoiding 18,000 tons of co2 emissions 1 according to industry sources for every litre of milk cooled 0.7 litres of warm water is produced water pumped through the plate heat exchanger reaches 50c to 55c the energy recovered from 1000 litres of milk per day over a year generates heat equal to 13,100 kwh of electrical energy 1,900 litres of oil 1,650 m of natural gas or 950kg of propane gas 14 climate changeedit according to the ex prime minister jan peter balkenende the netherlands use annually 1-1.5 billion   0.3 of national income to protect against the risks of the sea level rise many areas are under sea level in the netherlands and are protected by dam and dikes 15 the netherlands supported in 2010 raising the european union emission restrictions from 20 to 30 however the netherlands has only committed to reaching the minimum 14 goal for itself 1 historical trends 1990-2011edit the main sources of renewable energy up to 2011 were from biomass and wind power solar power was marginal with only 143 mw installed capacity by 2011 energy from hydroelectric sources in 2011 was only marginally greater than that provided from heat extracted from warm milk total renewable energy use was just 1.1 of overall energy use in 1990 the electricity sector first overtook the heating and cooling sector in 2005 in terms of total renewable energy use see alsoedit wind power in the netherlands solar power in the netherlands hydroelectric power in the netherlands electricity sector in the
