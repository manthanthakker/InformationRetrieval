lee schipper leon jay lee schipper april 7 1947  august 16 2011 was an energy efficiency expert and international environmentalist who devoted his life to understanding societal infrastructural and technological challenges to energy efficiency particularly in the heating and transport sectors lee schipper attended the university of california at berkeley in september 1964 studying physics and music he completed his double-major ba in 1968 moving straight into his phd in astrophysics in the physics department he completed his phd in 1985 at the time of his death schipper was a senior research scientist at both university of california berkeleys global metropolitan studies and at the precourt institute of energy efficiency at stanford university conducting research and policy analysis on efficient energy use in transportation systems he was co-founder of embarq the world resources institute center for sustainable transport and remained as a senior associate emeritus over a highly productive career he worked at the energy and resources group at uc berkeley lawrence berkeley national lab the international energy agency in paris shell international in london as well as being fulbright scholar at the beijer institute of ecological economics in stockholm he was a guest researcher at the world bank vvs tekniska foereningen the oecd and the stockholm environment institute he worked closely with the global business network and cambridge energy research associates schipper authored more than 100 technical papers and a number of books on energy economics and transportation including energy efficiency and human activity past trendsfuture prospects  1992 with stephen meyers richard howarth and ruth steiner he served on the editorial boards of five major journals and was a member of the swedish board for transportation and communications research for four years he was a member of the us national academy of sciences transportation research boards committee on sustainable transport and committee on developing countries he contributed to the second and third assessment reports of the intergovernmental panel on climate change which was awarded the nobel peace prize in 2007 he was due to act as review editor for the chapter on transport in working group iiis contribution to the fifth assessment report released in april 2014 in berkeley in the early 1970s professor john holdren later to become president obamas science advisor was the first person to hire schipper as an energy specialist he notes that lee was one of the first people to point out that people dont want to consume energy but they want to consume energy services like transportation comfortable rooms cold beer and so forth and that there was an enormous variation in the amount of energy needed to perform those services lees seminal contribution came in 1976 1 between the first and second international oil shocks when he published an influential paper in science  2 pointing out that sweden consumed far less energy per unit of economic activity than the united states did lee shifted his primary attention to transport in the 1980s and started the berkeley labs international energy studies group with jayant sathaye and the two co-led the group for many years schipper broke new ground by analyzing energy data sector by sector and end-use by end-use in various countries and comparing them he demonstrated that energy intensity did not correlate with gdp in any simple way and was able to show why the work he did has been carried on here he created an important tradition of understanding energy by studying it from the bottom up which means by end user levine said lee was the founding father of a school of energy analysts a tradition carried on with vigor in the energy analysis department at lbnl he was described as being an irrepressible iconoclast 3 with a wonderful knack of turning a phrase to excellent effect evidence for this was publishing 15 letters to the editor in the new york times on energy efficiency for example in his view the cash for clunkers programwhich offered rebates to people who bought a new car with better mileage than their old onedid little to save energy although it may have reduced air pollution in many cases buyers used the rebate to buy something bigger and more high-powered than they would have otherwise the effect is inverse of what we were hoping for he said schipper was also an accomplished musician with a ba in music from uc berkeley he was the leader of the university of california jazz quintet in 1968 4 as a uc berkeley student and vibraphonist he led his jazz group to victory at the notre dame jazz festival in 1967 in 1969 danish saxophonist carsten meinert invited him to record on his album cm musictrain in denmark spectator records in 1973 he recorded the phunky physicist with swedish guitarplayer janne schaffer he would reprise the role as band leader with an ad hoc jazz group lee schipper and the mitigators who performed primarily in conjunction with energy-related conferences he was also one of the worlds experts on wilhelm furtwangler perhaps the greatest symphonic and operatic conductor of the 20th century and collected one of the most complete sets of his recordings publicationsedit measuring the invisible quantifying emissions reductions from transport solutions
