walter diesendorf and the poet margaret diesendorf his phd research was focused on applied mathematics and theoretical physics applied to the solar interior his early postdoctoral research was diverse including the analysis of ground and satellite data on vlf emissions mechanisms of insect smell and vision and biological catalysts from 1975 to 1985 he worked in the csiro division of mathematics the australian national research organisation on topics such as the integration of wind power into electricity grids 1 he became a principal research scientist and leader of the applied mathematics group in csiro 2 he left csiro in 1985 after the organisation had terminated all research on renewable energy from 1996 to 2001 he was professor of environmental science and founding director of the institute for sustainable futures at uts and then director of a company sustainability centre pty ltd from 2004 to 2016 diesendorf has been a senior lecturer and then associate professor and deputy

honorary associate professor at unsw he continues to teach as a guest lecturer research and consult in the interdisciplinary fields of sustainable energy sustainable urban transport theory of sustainability ecological economics and practical processes by which government business and other organisations can achieve ecologically sustainable and socially just development 3 based on his belief that science technology and economics should serve the community at large dr diesendorf has been at various times the secretary of the society for social responsibility in science australian capital territory president of the australia new zealand society for ecological economics co-founder and vice-president of the sustainable energy industries council of australia and co-founder and president of the original australasian wind energy association 3 much of his recent and current research is on climate mitigation especially transitioning electricity supply systems to 100 renewable energy to this end he is involved with colleagues in the centre for energy  environmental markets at unsw in scenario development computer simulation modelling and energy policy previously dr diesendorf was one of the leading proponents calling for the ethical scientific debate over public water fluoridation 4 on this issue diesendorf has authored several papers including a major 1986 article entitled the mystery of declining tooth decay in the journal nature examining the need for a scientific re-evaluation of fluoridation and has highlighted some of the contrary evidence 1 5
