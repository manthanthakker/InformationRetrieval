nuclear proliferation history warfare winter workers arms race design testing ethics effects delivery espionage proliferation arsenals terrorism opposition v t e nuclear proliferation is the spread of nuclear weapons fissionable material and weapons-applicable nuclear technology and information to nations not recognized as nuclear weapon states by the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons also known as the nuclear nonproliferation treaty or npt proliferation has been opposed by many nations with and without nuclear weapons the governments of which fear that more countries with nuclear weapons may increase the possibility of nuclear warfare up to and including the so-called countervalue targeting of civilians with nuclear weapons de-stabilize international or regional relations or infringe upon the national sovereignty of states four countries besides the five recognized nuclear weapons states have acquired or are presumed to have acquired nuclear weapons india pakistan north korea and israel none of these four is a party to the npt although north korea acceded to the npt in 1985 then withdrew in 2003 and conducted announced nuclear tests in 2006 2009 2013 and 2016 1 one critique of the npt is that it is discriminatory in recognizing as nuclear weapon states only those countries that tested nuclear weapons before 1968 and requiring all other states joining the treaty to forswear nuclear weaponscitation needed research into the development of nuclear weapons was undertaken during world war ii by the united states in cooperation with the united kingdom and canada germany japan and the ussr the united states was the first and is the only country to have used a nuclear weapon in war when it used two bombs against japan in august 1945 with their loss during the war germany and japan ceased to be involved in any nuclear weapon research in august 1949 the ussr tested a nuclear weapon 2 the united kingdom tested a nuclear weapon in october 1952 france developed a nuclear weapon in 1960 the peoples republic of china detonated a nuclear weapon in 1964 india exploded a nuclear device in 1974 and pakistan conducted a series of nuclear weapon tests in may 1998 following tests by india earlier that month in 2006 north korea conducted its first nuclear test  contents 1 non-proliferation efforts 2 dual use technology 3 international

efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation involved intense government secrecy the wartime acquisition of known uranium stores the combined development trust and at times even outright sabotagesuch as the bombing of a heavy-water facility thought to be used for a german nuclear program none of these efforts were explicitly public because the weapon developments themselves were kept secret until the bombing of hiroshima earnest international efforts to promote nuclear non-proliferation began soon after world war ii when the truman administration proposed the baruch plan 3 of 1946 named after bernard baruch americas first representative to the united nations atomic energy commission the baruch plan which drew heavily from the achesonlilienthal report of 1946 proposed the verifiable dismantlement and destruction of the us nuclear arsenal which at that time was the only nuclear arsenal in the world after all governments had cooperated successfully to accomplish two things  1 the establishment of an international atomic development authority which would actually own and control all military-applicable nuclear materials and activities and  2 the creation of a system of automatic sanctions which not even the un security council could veto and which would proportionately punish states attempting to acquire the capability to make nuclear weapons or fissile material baruchs plea for the destruction of nuclear weapons invoked basic moral and religious intuitions in one part of his address to the un baruch said behind the black portent of the new atomic age lies a hope which seized upon with faith can work out our salvation if we fail then we have damned every man to be the slave of fear let us not deceive ourselves we must elect world peace or world destruction we must answer the worlds longing for peace and security 4 with this remark baruch helped launch the field of nuclear ethics to which many policy experts and scholars have contributed although the baruch plan enjoyed wide international support it failed to emerge from the unaec because the soviet union planned to veto it in the security council still it remained official american policy until 1953 when president eisenhower made his atoms for peace proposal before the un general assembly eisenhowers proposal led eventually to the creation of the international atomic energy agency iaea in 1957 under the atoms for peace program thousands of scientists from around the world were educated in nuclear science and then dispatched home where many later pursued secret weapons programs in their home country 5 efforts to conclude an international agreement to limit the spread of nuclear weapons did not begin until the early 1960s after four nations the united states the soviet union the united kingdom and france had acquired nuclear weapons see list of states with nuclear weapons for more information although these efforts stalled in the early 1960s they renewed once again in 1964 after china detonated a nuclear weapon in 1968 governments represented at the eighteen nation disarmament committee endc finished negotiations on the text of the npt in june 1968 the un general assembly endorsed the npt with general assembly resolution 2373 xxii and in july 1968 the npt opened for signature in washington dc london and moscow the npt entered into force in march 1970 since the mid-1970s the primary focus of non-proliferation efforts has been to maintain and even increase international control over the fissile material and specialized technologies necessary to build such devices because these are the most difficult and expensive parts of a nuclear weapons program the main materials whose generation and distribution is controlled are highly enriched uranium and plutonium other than the acquisition of these special materials the scientific and technical means for weapons construction to develop rudimentary but working nuclear explosive devices are considered to be within the reach of industrialized nations since its founding by the united nations in 1957 the international atomic energy agency iaea has promoted two sometimes contradictory missions on the one hand the agency seeks to promote and spread internationally the use of civilian nuclear energy on the other hand it seeks to prevent or at least detect the diversion of civilian nuclear energy to nuclear weapons nuclear explosive devices or purposes unknown the iaea now operates a safeguards system as specified under article iii of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty npt of 1968 which aims to ensure that civil stocks of uranium plutonium as well as facilities and technologies associated with these nuclear materials are used only for peaceful purposes and do not contribute in any way to proliferation or nuclear weapons programs it is often argued that proliferation of nuclear weapons to many other states has been prevented by the extension of assurances and mutual defence treaties to these states by nuclear powers but other factors such as national prestige or specific historical experiences also play a part in hastening or stopping nuclear proliferation 6 dual use technologyedit dual-use technology refers to the possibility of military use of civilian nuclear power technology many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability in that several stages of the nuclear fuel cycle allow diversion of nuclear materials for nuclear weapons when this happens a nuclear power program can become a route leading to the atomic bomb or a public annex to a secret bomb program the crisis over irans nuclear activities is a case in point 7 many un and us agencies warn that building more nuclear reactors unavoidably increases nuclear proliferation risks 8 a fundamental goal for american and global security is to minimize the proliferation risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power if this development is poorly managed or efforts to contain risks are unsuccessful the nuclear future will be dangerous 7 for nuclear power programs to be developed and managed safely and securely it is important that countries have domestic good governance characteristics that will encourage proper nuclear operations and management 7 these characteristics include low degrees of corruption to avoid officials selling materials and technology for their own personal gain as occurred with the aq khan smuggling network in pakistan high degrees of political stability defined by the world bank as likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means including politically-motivated violence and terrorism high governmental effectiveness scores a world bank aggregate measure of the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures and the quality of policy formulation and implementation and a strong degree of regulatory competence 7 international cooperationedit nuclear non-proliferation treatyedit at present 189 countries are states parties to the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons more commonly known as the nuclear nonproliferation treaty or npt these include the five nuclear weapons states nws recognized by the npt the peoples republic of china france russian federation the uk and the united states notable non-signatories to the npt are israel pakistan and india the latter two have since tested nuclear weapons while israel is considered by most to be an unacknowledged nuclear weapons state north korea was once a signatory but withdrew in january 2003 the legality of north koreas withdrawal is debatable but as of 9 october 2006 north korea clearly possesses the capability to make a nuclear explosive device international atomic energy agencyedit the iaea was established on 29 july 1957 to help nations develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes allied to this role is the administration of safeguards arrangements to provide assurance to the international community that individual countries are honoring their commitments under the treaty though established under its own international treaty the iaea reports to both the united nations general assembly and the security council the iaea regularly inspects civil nuclear facilities to verify the accuracy of documentation supplied to it the agency checks inventories and samples and analyzes materials safeguards are designed to deter diversion of nuclear material by increasing the risk of early detection they are complemented by controls on the export of sensitive technology from countries such as uk and united states through voluntary bodies such as the nuclear suppliers group the main concern of the iaea is that uranium not be enriched beyond what is necessary for commercial civil plants and that plutonium which is produced by nuclear reactors not be refined into a form that would be suitable for bomb production scope of safeguardsedit traditional safeguards are arrangements to account for and control the use of nuclear materials this verification is a key element in the international system which ensures that uranium in particular is used only for peaceful purposes parties to the npt agree to accept technical safeguard measures applied by the iaea these require that operators of nuclear facilities maintain and declare detailed accounting records of all movements and transactions involving nuclear material over 550 facilities and several hundred other locations are subject to regular inspection and their records and the nuclear material being audited inspections by the iaea are complemented by other measures such as surveillance cameras and instrumentation the inspections act as an alert system providing a warning of the possible diversion of nuclear material from peaceful activities the system relies on all npt non-weapons states must accept these full-scope safeguards in the five weapons states plus the non-npt states india pakistan and israel facility-specific safeguards apply iaea inspectors regularly visit these facilities to verify completeness and accuracy of records the terms of the npt cannot be enforced by the iaea itself nor can nations be forced to sign the treaty in reality as shown in iraq and north korea safeguards can be backed up by diplomatic political and economic measures while traditional safeguards easily verified the correctness of formal declarations by suspect states in the 1990s attention turned to what might not have been declared while accepting safeguards at declared facilities iraq had set up elaborate equipment elsewhere in an attempt to enrich uranium to weapons grade north korea attempted to use research reactors not commercial electricity-generating reactors and a reprocessing plant to produce some weapons-grade plutonium the weakness of the npt regime lay in the fact that no obvious diversion of material was involved the uranium used as fuel probably came from indigenous sources and the nuclear facilities were built by the countries themselves without being declared or placed under safeguards iraq as an npt party was obliged to declare all facilities but did not do so nevertheless the activities were detected and brought under control using international diplomacy in iraq a military defeat assisted this process in north korea the activities concerned took place before the conclusion of its npt safeguards agreement with north korea the promised provision of commercial power reactors appeared to resolve the situation for a time but it later withdrew from the npt and declared it had nuclear weapons additional protocoledit in 1993 a program was initiated to strengthen and extend the classical safeguards system and a model protocol was agreed by the iaea board of governors 1997 the measures boosted the iaeas ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities including those with no connection to the civil fuel cycle innovations were of two kinds some could be implemented on the basis of iaeas existing legal authority through safeguards agreements and inspections others required further legal authority to be conferred through an additional protocol this must be agreed by each non-weapons state with iaea as a supplement to any existing comprehensive safeguards agreement weapons states have agreed to accept the principles of the model additional protocol key elements of the model additional protocol the iaea is to be given considerably more information on nuclear and nuclear-related activities including r  d production of uranium and thorium regardless of whether it is traded and nuclear-related imports and exports iaea inspectors will have greater rights of access this will include any suspect location it can be at short notice eg two hours and the iaea can deploy environmental sampling and remote monitoring techniques to detect illicit activities states must streamline administrative procedures so that iaea inspectors get automatic visa renewal and can communicate more readily with iaea headquarters further evolution of safeguards is towards evaluation of each state taking account of its particular situation and the kind of nuclear materials it has this will involve greater judgement on the part of iaea and the development of effective methodologies which reassure npt states as of 3 july 2015 146 countries have signed additional protocols and 126 have brought them into force the iaea is also applying the measures of the additional protocol in taiwan 9 under the joint comprehensive plan of action iran has agreed to implement its protocol provisionally among the leading countries that have not signed the additional protocol are egypt which says it will not sign until israel accepts comprehensive iaea safeguards 10 and brazil which opposes making the protocol a requirement for international cooperation on enrichment and reprocessing 11 but has not ruled out signing 12 limitations of safeguardsedit the greatest risk from nuclear weapons proliferation comes from countries which have not joined the npt and which have significant unsafeguarded nuclear activities india pakistan and israel fall within this category while safeguards apply to some of their activities others remain beyond scrutiny a further concern is that countries may develop various sensitive nuclear fuel cycle facilities and research reactors under full safeguards and then subsequently opt out of the npt bilateral agreements such as insisted upon by australia and canada for sale of uranium address this by including fallback provisions but many countries are outside the scope of these agreements if a nuclear-capable country does leave the npt it is likely to be reported by the iaea to the un security council just as if it were in breach of its safeguards agreement trade sanctions would then be likely iaea safeguards can help ensure that uranium supplied as nuclear fuel and other nuclear supplies do not contribute to nuclear weapons proliferation in fact the worldwide application of those safeguards and the substantial world trade in uranium for nuclear electricity make the proliferation of nuclear weapons much less likely the additional protocol once it is widely in force will provide credible assurance that there are no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in the states concerned this will be a major step forward in preventing nuclear proliferation other developmentsedit the nuclear suppliers group communicated its guidelines essentially a set of export rules to the iaea in 1978 these were to ensure that transfers of nuclear material or equipment would not be diverted to unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle or nuclear explosive activities and formal government assurances to this effect were required from recipients the guidelines also recognised the need for physical protection measures in the transfer of sensitive facilities technology and weapons-usable materials and strengthened retransfer provisions the group began with seven members the united states the former ussr the uk france germany canada and japan but now includes 46 countries including all five nuclear weapons states the international framework for nuclear energy cooperation is an international project involving 25 partner countries 28 observer and candidate partner countries and the international atomic energy agency the generation iv international forum and the european commission its goal is to  provide competitive commercially-based services as an alternative to a states development of costly proliferation-sensitive facilities and address other issues associated with the safe and secure management of used fuel and radioactive waste 13 according to kenneth d bergerons tritium on ice the dangerous new alliance of nuclear weapons and nuclear power tritium is not classified as a special nuclear material but rather as a by-product it is seen as an important litmus test on the seriousness of the united states intention to nuclear disarm this radioactive super-heavy hydrogen isotope is used to boost the efficiency of fissile materials in nuclear weapons the united states resumed tritium production in 2003 for the first time in 15 years this could indicate that there is a potential nuclear arm stockpile replacement since the isotope naturally decays in may 1995 npt parties reaffirmed their commitment to a fissile materials cut-off treaty to prohibit the production of any further fissile material for weapons this aims to complement the comprehensive test ban treaty of 1996 not entered into force as of 2011 and to codify commitments made by the united states the uk france and russia to cease production of weapons material as well as putting a similar ban on china this treaty will also put more pressure on israel india and pakistan to agree to international verificationcitation needed on 9 august 2005 ayatollah ali khamenei issued a fatwa forbidding the production stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons khameneis official statement was made at the meeting of the international atomic energy agency iaea in vienna 14 as of february 2006 iran formally announced that uranium enrichment within their borders has continued iran claims it is for peaceful purposes but the united kingdom france germany and the united states claim the purpose is for nuclear weapons research and construction 15 unsanctioned nuclear activityedit

book category v t e npt non signatoriesedit india pakistan and israel have been threshold countries in terms of the international non-proliferation regime they possess or are quickly capable of assembling one or more nuclear weapons they have remained outside the 1970 npt they are thus largely excluded from trade in nuclear plant or materials except for safety-related devices for a few safeguarded facilities in may 1998 india and pakistan each exploded several nuclear devices underground this heightened concerns regarding an arms race between them with pakistan involving the peoples republic of china an acknowledged nuclear weapons state both countries are opposed to the npt as it stands and india has consistently attacked the treaty since its inception in 1970 labeling it as a lopsided treaty in favor of the nuclear powers relations between the two countries are tense and hostile and the risks of nuclear conflict between them have long been considered quite high kashmir is a prime cause of bilateral tension its sovereignty being in dispute since 1948 there is persistent low level bilateral military conflict due to alleged backing of insurgency by pakistan in india and correspondingly indian sponsoring of terrorism in pakistan  16 17 along with the disputed status of kashmir both engaged in a conventional arms race in the 1980s including sophisticated technology and equipment capable of delivering nuclear weapons in the 1990s the arms race quickened in 1994 india reversed a four-year trend of reduced allocations for defence and despite its much smaller economy pakistan was expected to push its own expenditures yet higher both have lost their patrons india the former ussr and pakistan the united states but it is the growth and modernization of chinas nuclear arsenal and its assistance with pakistans nuclear power programme and reportedly with missile technology which exacerbate indian concerns in particular as viewed by indian strategists pakistan is aided by chinas peoples liberation army indiaedit nuclear power for civil use is well established in india its civil nuclear strategy has been directed towards complete independence in the nuclear fuel cycle necessary because of its outspoken rejection of the npt this self-sufficiency extends from uranium exploration and mining through fuel fabrication heavy water production reactor design and construction to reprocessing and waste management it has a small fast breeder reactor and is planning a much larger one it is also developing technology to utilise its abundant resources of thorium as a nuclear fuel india has 14 small nuclear power reactors in commercial operation two larger ones under construction and ten more planned the 14 operating ones  2548 mwe total comprise two 150 mwe bwrs from the united states which started up in 1969 now use locally enriched uranium and are under safeguards two small canadian phwrs  1972  1980 also under safeguards and ten local phwrs based on canadian designs two of 150 and eight 200 mwe two new 540 mwe and two 700 mwe plants at tarapur known as tapp tarapur atomic power project the two under construction and two of the planned ones are 450 mwe versions of these 200 mwe domestic products construction has been seriously delayed by financial and technical problems in 2001 a final agreement was signed with russia for the countrys first large nuclear power plant comprising two vver-1000 reactors under a russian-financed us$3 billion contract the first unit is due to be commissioned in 2007 a further two russian units are under consideration for the site nuclear power supplied 3.1 of indias electricity in 2000 its weapons material appears to come from a canadian-designed 40mw research reactor which started up in 1960 well before the npt and a 100mw indigenous unit in operation since 1985 both use local uranium as india does not import any nuclear fuel it is estimated that india may have built up enough weapons-grade plutonium for a hundred nuclear warheads it is widely believed that the nuclear programs of india and pakistan used candu reactors to produce fissionable materials for their weapons however this is not accurate both canada by supplying the 40 mw research reactor and the united states by supplying 21 tons of heavy water supplied india with the technology necessary to create a nuclear weapons program dubbed cirus canada-india reactor united states canada sold india the reactor on the condition that the reactor and any by-products would be employed for peaceful purposes only similarly the united states sold india heavy water for use in the reactor only in connection with research into and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes india in violation of these agreements used the canadian-supplied reactor and american-supplied heavy water to produce plutonium for their first nuclear explosion smiling buddha 18 the indian government controversially justified this however by claiming that smiling buddha was a peaceful nuclear explosion the country has at least three other research reactors including the tiny one which is exploring the use of thorium as a nuclear fuel by breeding fissile u-233 in addition an advanced heavy-water thorium cycle is under development india exploded a nuclear device in 1974 the so-called smiling buddha test which it has consistently claimed was for peaceful purposes others saw it as a response to chinas nuclear weapons capability it was then universally perceived notwithstanding official denials to possess or to be able to quickly assemble nuclear weapons in 1999 it deployed its own medium-range missile and has developed an intermediate-range missile capable of reaching targets in chinas industrial heartland in 1995 the united states quietly intervened to head off a proposed nuclear test however in 1998 there were five more tests in operation shakti these were unambiguously military including one claimed to be of a sophisticated thermonuclear device and their declared purpose was to help in the design of nuclear weapons of different yields and different delivery systems indian security policies are driven by its determination to be recognized as a dominant power in the region its increasing concern with chinas expanding nuclear weapons and missile delivery programmes its concern with pakistans capability to deliver nuclear weapons deep into india it perceives nuclear weapons as a cost-effective political counter to chinas nuclear and conventional weaponry and the effects of its nuclear weapons policy in provoking pakistan is by some accounts considered incidental india has had an unhappy relationship with china after an uneasy ceasefire ended the 1962 war relations between the two nations were frozen until 1998 since then a degree of high-level contact has been established and a few elementary confidence-building measures put in place china still occupies some territory which it captured during the aforementioned war claimed by india and india still occupies some territory claimed by china its nuclear weapon and missile support for pakistan is a major bone of contention american president george w bush met with india prime minister manmohan singh to discuss indias involvement with nuclear weapons the two countries agreed that the united states would give nuclear power assistance to indiacitation needed pakistanedit over the several years the nuclear power infrastructure has been well established by pakistan which is dedicated for the industrial and economic development of the country 19 its current nuclear policy is directed and aimed to promote the socio-economic development of the people as a foremost priority 20 and to fulfill the energy economic and industrial needs from the nuclear sources 20 currently there are three operational mega-commercial nuclear power plants while three larger ones are under construction 19 the nuclear power supplies 787mw roughly ~3.6 of electricity as of 2012 and the country has projected to produce 8800mw electricity by 2030 21 infrastructure established by the iaea and the us in the 1950s–1960s were based on peaceful research and development and economic prosperity of the country 22 although the civil-sector nuclear power was established in the 1950s the country has an active nuclear weapons program which was started in the 1970s 22 the bomb program has its roots after east-pakistan gained its independence as bangladesh after indias successful intervention led to a decisive victory on pakistan in 1971 22 this large-scale but clandestine atomic bomb project was directed towards the development of ingenious development of reactor and military-grade plutoniumcitation needed in 1974 when india surprised the outer world with its successful detonation of its own bomb codename smiling buddha it became imperative for pakistan to pursue the weapons research 23 according to leading scientist in the program it became clear once india detonated the bomb newtons third law came into operation from then on it was a classic case of action and reaction 23 earlier efforts were directed towards mastering the plutonium technology from france but plutonium route was partially slowed down when the plan was failed after the us intervention to cancel the projectcitation needed contrary to popular perception pakistan did not forego the plutonium route and covertly continued its indegenious research under munir khan and it succeeded with plutonium route in the early 1980scitation needed reacting on indias nuclear test smiling buddha bhutto and the countrys elite political and military science circle sensed this test as final and dangerous anticipation to pakistans moral and physical existence 24 with aziz ahmed on his side bhutto launched a serious diplomatic offense and aggressively maintained at the session of the united nations security council pakistan was exposed to a kind of nuclear threat and blackmail unparalleled elsewhere  if the worlds community failed to provide political insurance to pakistan and other countries against the nuclear blackmail these countries would be constraint to launch atomic bomb programs of their own assurances provided by the united nations were not enough after 1974 bhuttos government redoubled its effort this time equally focused on uranium and plutonium 26 pakistan had established science directorates in almost all of her embassies in the important countries of the world with theoretical physicist sa butt being the director 26 abdul qadeer khan then established a network through dubai to smuggle urenco technology to engineering research laboratories 27 28 29 30 31 32 earlier he worked with physics dynamics research laboratories fdo a subsidiary of the dutch firm vmf-stork based in amsterdam later after joining the urenco he had access through photographs and documents of the technology 5 against the popular perception the technology that aq khan had brought from urenco was based on first generation civil rector technology filled with many serious technical errors though it was authentic and vital link for centrifuge project of the countrycitation needed after the british government stopped the british subsidiary of the american emerson electric co from shipping the components to pakistan he describes his frustration with a supplier from germany as that man from the german team was unethical 5 when he did not get the order from us he wrote a letter to a labour party member and questions were asked in british parliament 5 by 1978 his efforts were paid off and made him into a national hero 5 in 1981 as a tribute president general muhammad zia-ul-haq renamed the research institute after his name 5 in early 1996 prime minister benazir bhutto made it clear that if india conducts a nuclear test pakistan could be forced to follow suit 33 34 in 1997 her statement was echoed by prime minister nawaz sharif who maintained to the fact that since 1972 pakistan had progressed significantly and we have left that stage developmental far behind pakistan will not be made a hostage to india by signing the ctbt before india 35 in may 1998 within weeks of indias nuclear tests pakistan announced that it had conducted six underground tests in the chagai hills five on the 28th and one on the 30th of that month seismic events consistent with these claims were recorded in 2004 the revelation of aq khans efforts led the exposure of many defunct european consortium who defied export restrictions in the 1970s and many of defunct dutch companies exported thousands of centrifuges to pakistan as early as 1976 36 many centrifuge components were apparently manufactured in malaysian scomi precision engineering with the assistance of south asian and german companies and used a uae-based computer company as a false front 37 it was widely believed to have direct involvement of the government of pakistan 38 this claim could not be verified due to the refusal of the government of pakistan to allow iaea to interview the alleged head of the nuclear black market who happened to be no other than aq khan confessing his crimes later a month on national television he bailed out the government by taking full responsibility 38 independent investigation conducted by iiss confirmed that he had control over the import-export deals and his acquisition activities were largely unsupervised by pakistan governmental authorities 38 all of his activities went undetected for several years he duly confessed of running the atomic proliferation ring from pakistan to iran and north korea 39 he was immediately given presidential immunity 38 exact nature of the involvement at the governmental level is still unclear but the manner in which the government acted cast doubt on the sincerity of pakistan 38 north koreaedit the democratic peoples republic of korea or better known as north korea joined the npt in 1985 and had subsequently signed a safeguards agreement with the iaea however it was believed that north korea was diverting plutonium extracted from the fuel of its reactor at yongbyon for use in nuclear weapons the subsequent confrontation with iaea on the issue of inspections and suspected violations resulted in north korea threatening to withdraw from the npt in 1993 this eventually led to negotiations with the united states resulting in the agreed framework of 1994 which provided for iaea safeguards being applied to its reactors and spent fuel rods these spent fuel rods were sealed in canisters by the united states to prevent north korea from extracting plutonium from them north korea had to therefore freeze its plutonium programme during this period pakistan-north korea cooperation in missile technology transfer was being established a high level delegation of pakistan military visited north korea in augustseptember 1992 reportedly to discuss the supply of missile technology to pakistan in 1993 pm benazir bhutto repeatedly traveled to china and the paid state visit to north korea the visits are believed to be related to the subsequent acquisition technology to developed its ghauri system by pakistan during the period 1992–1994 aq khan was reported to have visited north korea thirteen times the missile cooperation program with north korea was under dr a q khan research laboratories at this time china was under us pressure not to supply the m dongfeng series of missiles to pakistan it is believed by experts that possibly with chinese connivance and facilitation the latter was forced to approach north korea for missile transfers reports indicate that north korea was willing to supply missile sub-systems including rocket motors inertial guidance systems control and testing equipment for us$50 million it is not clear what north korea got in return joseph s bermudez jr in janes defence weekly  27 november 2002 reports that western analysts had begun to question what north korea received in payment for the missiles many suspected it was the nuclear technology the krl was in charge of both uranium program and also of the missile program with north korea it is therefore likely during this period that cooperation in nuclear technology between pakistan and north korea was initiated western intelligence agencies began to notice exchange of personnel technology and components between krl and entities of the north korean 2nd economic committee responsible for weapons production a new york times report on 18 october 2002 quoted us intelligence officials having stated that pakistan was a major supplier of critical equipment to north korea the report added that equipment such as gas centrifuges appeared to have been part of a barter deal in which north korea supplied pakistan with missiles separate reports indicate the washington times 22 november 2002 that us intelligence had as early as 1999 picked up signs that north korea was continuing to develop nuclear arms other reports also indicate that north korea had been working covertly to develop an enrichment capability for nuclear weapons for at least five years and had used technology obtained from pakistan washington times 18 october 2002 israeledit israel is also thought to possess an arsenal of potentially up to several hundred nuclear warheads based on estimates of the amount of fissile material produced by israel 40 this has never been openly confirmed or denied however due to israels policy of deliberate ambiguity 41 an israeli nuclear installation is located about ten kilometers to the south of dimona the negev nuclear research center its construction commenced in 1958 with french assistance the official reason given by the israeli and french governments was to build a nuclear reactor to power a desalination plant in order to green the negev the purpose of the dimona plant is widely assumed to be the manufacturing of nuclear weapons and the majority of defense experts have concluded that it does in fact do thatcitation needed however the israeli government refuses to confirm or deny this publicly a policy it refers to as ambiguity norway sold 20 tonnes of heavy water needed for the reactor to israel in 1959 and 1960 in a secret deal there were no safeguards required in this deal to prevent usage of the heavy water for non-peaceful purposes the british newspaper daily express accused israel of working on a bomb in 1960 42 when the united states intelligence community discovered the purpose of the dimona plant in the early 1960s it demanded that israel agree to international inspections israel agreed but on a condition that us rather than iaea inspectors were used and that israel would receive advanced notice of all inspections some claim that because israel knew the schedule of the inspectors visits it was able to hide the alleged purpose of the site from the inspectors by installing temporary false walls and other devices before each inspection the inspectors eventually informed the us government that their inspections were useless due to israeli restrictions on what areas of the facility they could inspect in 1969 the united states terminated the inspections in 1986 mordechai vanunu a former technician at the dimona plant revealed to the media some evidence of israels nuclear program israeli agents arrested him from italy drugged him and transported him to israel and an israeli court then tried him in secret on charges of treason and espionage 43 and sentenced him to eighteen years imprisonment he was freed on 21 april 2004 but was severely limited by the israeli government he was arrested again on 11 november 2004 though formal charges were not immediately filed comments on photographs taken by mordechai vanunu inside the negev nuclear research center have been made by prominent scientists british nuclear weapons scientist frank barnaby who questioned vanunu over several days estimated israel had enough plutonium for about 150 weapons 44 ted taylor a bomb designer employed by the united states has confirmed the several hundred warhead estimate based on vanunus photographscitation needed according to lieutenant colonel warner d farr in a report to the usaf counterproliferation center while france was previously a leader in nuclear research israel and france were at a similar level of expertise after wwii and israeli scientists could make significant contributions to the french effort 45 in 1986 francis perrin french high-commissioner for atomic energy from 1951 to 1970 stated that in 1949 israeli scientists were invited to the saclay nuclear research facility this cooperation leading to a joint effort including sharing of knowledge between french and israeli scientists especially those with knowledge from the manhattan project 46 47 48 nuclear arms control in south asiaedit the public stance of the two states on non-proliferation differs markedly pakistan has initiated a series of regional security proposals it has repeatedly proposed a nuclear free zone in south asia and has proclaimed its willingness to engage in nuclear disarmament and to sign the non-proliferation treaty if india would do so it has endorsed a united states proposal for a regional five power conference to consider non-proliferation in south asia india has taken the view that solutions to regional security issues should be found at the international rather than the regional level since its chief concern is with china it therefore rejects pakistans proposals instead the gandhi plan put forward in 1988 proposed the revision of the non-proliferation treaty which it regards as inherently discriminatory in favor of the nuclear-weapon states and a timetable for complete nuclear weapons disarmament it endorsed early proposals for a comprehensive test ban treaty and for an international convention to ban the production of highly enriched uranium and plutonium for weapons purposes known as the cut-off convention the united states for some years especially under the clinton administration pursued a variety of initiatives to persuade india and pakistan to abandon their nuclear weapons programs and to accept comprehensive international safeguards on all their nuclear activities to this end the clinton administration proposed a conference of the five nuclear-weapon states japan germany india and pakistan india refused this and similar previous proposals and countered with demands that other potential weapons states such as iran and north korea should be invited and that regional limitations would only be acceptable if they were accepted equally by china the united states would not accept the participation of iran and north korea and these initiatives have lapsed another more recent approach centers on capping the production of fissile material for weapons purposes which would hopefully be followed by roll back to this end india and the united states jointly sponsored a un general assembly resolution in 1993 calling for negotiations for a cut-off convention should india and pakistan join such a convention they would have to agree to halt the production of fissile materials for weapons and to accept international verification on their relevant nuclear facilities enrichment and reprocessing plants it appears that india is now prepared to join negotiations regarding such a cut-off treaty under the un conference on disarmament bilateral confidence-building measures between india and pakistan to reduce the prospects of confrontation have been limited in 1990 each side ratified a treaty not to attack the others nuclear installations and at the end of 1991 they provided one another with a list showing the location of all their nuclear plants even though the respective lists were regarded as not being wholly accurate early in 1994 india proposed a bilateral agreement for a no first use of nuclear weapons and an extension of the no attack treaty to cover civilian and industrial targets as well as nuclear installations having promoted the comprehensive test ban treaty since 1954 india dropped its support in 1995 and in 1996 attempted to block the treaty following the 1998 tests the question has been reopened and both pakistan and india have indicated their intention to sign the ctbt indian ratification may be conditional upon the five weapons states agreeing to specific reductions in nuclear arsenals the un conference on disarmament has also called upon both countries to accede without delay to the non-proliferation treaty presumably as non-weapons states npt signatoriesedit egyptedit in 2004 and 2005 egypt disclosed past undeclared nuclear activities and material to the iaea in 2007 and 2008 high enriched and low enriched uranium particles were found in environmental samples taken in egypt 49 in 2008 the iaea states egypts statements were consistent with its own findings 50 in may 2009 reuters reported that the iaea was conducting further investigation in egypt 51 52 iranedit in 2003 the iaea reported that iran had been in breach of its obligations to comply with provisions of its safeguard agreement 53 in 2005 the iaea board of governors voted in a rare non-consensus decision to find iran in non-compliance with its npt safeguards agreement and to report that non-compliance to the un security council 54 55 in response the un security council passed a series of resolutions citing concerns about the program 56 57 58 59 60 irans representative to the un argues sanctions compel iran to abandon its rights under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty to peaceful nuclear technology 61 iran says its uranium enrichment program is exclusively for peaceful purposes 62 63 and has enriched uranium to less than 5 percent consistent with fuel for a nuclear power plant and significantly below the purity of weu around 90 typically used in a weapons program 64 65 the director general of the international atomic energy agency yukiya amano said in 2009 he had not seen any evidence in iaea official documents that iran was developing nuclear weapons 66 iraqedit up to the late 1980s it was generally assumed that any undeclared nuclear activities would have to be based on the diversion of nuclear material from safeguards states acknowledged the possibility of nuclear activities entirely separate from those covered by safeguards but it was assumed they would be detected by national intelligence activities there was no particular effort by iaea to attempt to detect them iraq had been making efforts to secure a nuclear potential since the 1960s in the late 1970s a specialised plant osiraq was constructed near baghdad the plant was attacked during the iraniraq war and was destroyed by israeli bombers in june 1981 not until the 1990 npt review conference did some states raise the possibility of making more use of for example provisions for special inspections in existing npt safeguards agreements special inspections can be undertaken at locations other than those where safeguards routinely apply if there is reason to believe there may be undeclared material or activities after inspections in iraq following the un gulf war cease-fire resolution showed the extent of iraqs clandestine nuclear weapons program it became clear that the iaea would have to broaden the scope of its activities iraq was an npt party and had thus agreed to place all its nuclear material under iaea safeguards but the inspections revealed that it had been pursuing an extensive clandestine uranium enrichment programme as well as a nuclear weapons design programme the main thrust of iraqs uranium enrichment program was the development of technology for electromagnetic isotope separation emis of indigenous uranium this uses the same principles as a mass spectrometer albeit on a much larger scale ions of uranium-238 and uranium-235 are separated because they describe arcs of different radii when they move through a magnetic field this process was used in the manhattan project to make the highly enriched uranium used in the hiroshima bomb but was abandoned soon afterwards the iraqis did the basic research work at their nuclear research establishment at tuwaitha near baghdad and were building two full-scale facilities at tarmiya and ash sharqat north of baghdad however when the war broke out only a few separators had been installed at tarmiya and none at ash sharqat the iraqis were also very interested in centrifuge enrichment and had been able to acquire some components including some carbon-fibre rotors which they were at an early stage of testing in may 1998 newsweek reported that abdul qadeer khan had sent iraq centrifuge designs which were apparently confiscated by the unmovic officials iraqi officials said the documents were authentic but that they had not agreed to work with a q khan fearing an isi sting operation due to strained relations between two countriescitation needed 67 the government of pakistan and a q khan strongly denied this allegation whilst the government declared the evidence to be fraudulent 68 they were clearly in violation of their npt and safeguards obligations and the iaea board of governors ruled to that effect the un security council then ordered the iaea to remove destroy or render harmless iraqs nuclear weapons capability this was done by mid-1998 but iraq then ceased all cooperation with the un so the iaea withdrew from this work the revelations from iraq provided the impetus for a very far-reaching reconsideration of what safeguards are intended to achieve libyaedit libya possesses ballistic missiles and previously pursued nuclear weapons under the leadership of muammar gaddafi on 19 december 2003 gaddafi announced that libya would voluntarily eliminate all materials equipment and programs that could lead to internationally proscribed weapons including weapons of mass destruction and long-range ballistic missiles 69 70 71 libya signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty npt in 1968 and ratified it in 1975 and concluded a safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency iaea in 1980 72 in march 2004 the iaea board of governors welcomed libyas decision to eliminate its formerly undeclared nuclear program which it found had violated libyas safeguards agreement and approved libyas additional protocol 70 73 the united states and the united kingdom assisted libya in removing equipment and material from its nuclear weapons program with independent verification by the iaea 71 myanmaredit a report in the sydney morning herald and searchina a japanese newspaper report that two myanmarese defectors saying that the myanmar junta was secretly building a nuclear reactor and plutonium extraction facility with north koreas help with the aim of acquiring its first nuclear bomb in five years according to the report the secret complex much of it in caves tunnelled into a mountain at naung laing in northern burma runs parallel to a civilian reactor being built at another site by russia that both the russians and burmese say will be put under international safeguards 74 in 2002 myanmar had notified iaea of its intention to pursue a civilian nuclear programme later russia announced that it would build a nuclear reactor in myanmar there have also been reports that two pakistani scientists from the aq khan stable had been dispatched to myanmar where they had settled down to help myanmars projectcitation needed recently the david albright-led institute for science and international security isis rang alarm bells about myanmar attempting a nuclear project with north korean helpcitation needed if true the full weight of international pressure will be brought against myanmar said officials familiar with developments but equally the information that has been peddled by the defectors is also preliminary and could be used by the west to turn the screws on myanmaron democracy and human rights issuesin the run-up to the elections in the country in 2010citation needed during an asean meeting in thailand in july 2009 us secretary of state hillary clinton highlighted concerns of the north korean link we know there are also growing concerns about military cooperation between north korea and burma which we take very seriously clinton said 75 however in 2012 after contact with the american president barack obama the burmese leader thein sein renounced military ties with dprk north korea 76 north koreaedit the democratic peoples republic of korea dprk acceded to the npt in 1985 as a condition for the supply of a nuclear power station by the ussr however it delayed concluding its npt safeguards agreement with the iaea a process which should take only 18 months until april 1992 during that period it brought into operation a small gas-cooled graphite-moderated natural-uranium metal fuelled experimental power reactor of about 25 mwt  5 mwe based on the uk magnox design while this was a well-suited design to start a wholly indigenous nuclear reactor development it also exhibited all the features of a small plutonium production reactor for weapons purposes north korea also made substantial progress in the construction of two larger reactors designed on the same principles a prototype of about 200 mwt  50 mwe and a full-scale version of about 800 mwt  200 mwe they made only slow progress construction halted on both in 1994 and has not resumed both reactors have degraded considerably since that time and would take significant efforts to refurbish in addition it completed and commissioned a reprocessing plant that makes the magnox spent nuclear fuel safe recovering uranium and plutonium that plutonium if the fuel was only irradiated to a very low burn-up would have been in a form very suitable for weapons although all these facilities at yongbyon were to be under safeguards there was always the risk that at some stage the dprk would withdraw from the npt and use the plutonium for weapons one of the first steps in applying npt safeguards is for the iaea to verify the initial stocks of uranium and plutonium to ensure that all the nuclear materials in the country have been declared for safeguards purposes while undertaking this work in 1992 iaea inspectors found discrepancies which indicated that the reprocessing plant had been used more often than the dprk had declared which suggested that the dprk could have weapons-grade plutonium which it had not declared to the iaea information passed to the iaea by a member state as required by the iaea supported that suggestion by indicating that the dprk had two undeclared waste or other storage sites in february 1993 the iaea called on the dprk to allow special inspections of the two sites so that the initial stocks of nuclear material could be verified the dprk refused and on 12 march announced its intention to withdraw from the npt three months notice is required in april 1993 the iaea board concluded that the dprk was in non-compliance with its safeguards obligations and reported the matter to the un security council in june 1993 the dprk announced that it had suspended its withdrawal from the npt but subsequently claimed a special status with respect to its safeguards obligations this was rejected by iaea once the dprks non-compliance had been reported to the un security council the essential part of the iaeas mission had been completed inspections in the dprk continued although inspectors were increasingly hampered in what they were permitted to do by the dprks claim of a special status however some 8,000 corroding fuel rods associated with the experimental reactor have remained under close surveillance following bilateral negotiations between the united states and the dprk and the conclusion of the agreed framework in october 1994 the iaea has been given additional responsibilities the agreement requires a freeze on the operation and construction of the dprks plutonium production reactors and their related facilities and the iaea is responsible for monitoring the freeze until the facilities are eventually dismantled the dprk remains uncooperative with the iaea verification work and has yet to comply with its safeguards agreement while iraq was defeated in a war allowing the un the opportunity to seek out and destroy its nuclear weapons programme as part of the cease-fire conditions the dprk was not defeated nor was it vulnerable to other measures such as trade sanctions it can scarcely afford to import anything and sanctions on vital commodities such as oil would either be ineffective or risk provoking warcitation needed ultimately the dprk was persuaded to stop what appeared to be its nuclear weapons programme in exchange under the agreed framework for about us$5 billion in energy-related assistance this included two 1000 mwe light water nuclear power reactors based on an advanced us system-80 design in january 2003 the dprk withdrew from the npt in response a series of discussions among the dprk the united states and china a series of six-party talks the parties being the dprk the rok china japan the united states and russia were held in beijing the first beginning in april 2004 concerning north koreas weapons program on 10 january 2005 north korea declared that it was in the possession of nuclear weapons on 19 september 2005 the fourth round of the six-party talks ended with a joint statement in which north korea agreed to end its nuclear programs and return to the npt in exchange for diplomatic energy and economic assistance however by the end of 2005 the dprk had halted all six-party talks because the united states froze certain dprk international financial assets such as those in a bank in macau on 9 october 2006 north korea announced that it has performed its first-ever nuclear weapon test on 18 december 2006 the six-party talks finally resumed on 13 february 2007 the parties announced initial actions to implement the 2005 joint statement including shutdown and disablement of north korean nuclear facilities in exchange for energy assistance reacting to un sanctions imposed after missile tests in april 2009 north korea withdrew from the six-party talks restarted its nuclear facilities and conducted a second nuclear test on 25 may 2009 on 12 february 2013 north korea conducted an underground nuclear explosion with an estimated yield of 6 to 7 kilotonnes the detonation registered a magnitude 4.9 disturbance in the area around the epicenter see also north korea and weapons of mass destruction and six-party talks russiaedit security of nuclear weapons in russia remains a matter of concern according to high-ranking russian svr defector tretyakov he had a meeting with two russian businessman representing a state-created c-w corporation in 1991 they came up with a project of destroying large quantities of chemical wastes collected from western countries at the island of novaya zemlya a test place for soviet nuclear weapons using an underground nuclear blast the project was rejected by canadian representatives but one of the businessmen told tretyakov that he keeps his own nuclear bomb at his dacha outside moscow tretyakov thought that man was insane but the businessmen vladimir k dmitriev replied do not be so naive with economic conditions the way they are in russia today anyone with enough money can buy a nuclear bomb its no big deal really 77 south africaedit in 1991 south africa acceded to the npt concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the iaea and submitted a report on its nuclear material subject to safeguards 78 at the time the state had a nuclear power programme producing nearly 10 of the countrys electricity whereas iraq and north korea only had research reactors the iaeas initial verification task was complicated by south africas announcement that between 1979 and 1989 it built and then dismantled a number of nuclear weapons south africa asked the iaea to verify the conclusion of its weapons programme in 1995 the iaea declared that it was satisfied all materials were accounted for and the weapons programme had been terminated and dismantled south africa has signed the npt and now holds the distinction of being the only known state to have indigenously produced nuclear weapons and then verifiably dismantled them 79 syriaedit on 6 september 2007 israel bombed an officially unidentified site in syria which it later asserted was a nuclear reactor under construction see operation orchard 80 the alleged reactor was not asserted to be operational and it was not asserted that nuclear material had been introduced into it 49 syria said the site was a military site and was not involved in any nuclear activities 49 the iaea requested syria to provide further access to the site and any other locations where the debris and equipment from the building had been stored 49 syria denounced what it called the western fabrication and forging of facts in regards to the incident 81 iaea director general mohamed elbaradei criticized the strikes and deplored that information regarding the matter had not been shared with his agency earlier 82 breakout capabilityedit for a state that does not possess nuclear weapons the capability to produce one or more weapons quickly and with little warning is called a breakout capability 83 japan with its civil nuclear infrastructure and experience has a stockpile of separated plutonium that could be fabricated into weapons relatively quickly 84 iran according to some observers may be seeking or have already achieved a breakout capability with its stockpile of low-enriched uranium and its capability to enrich further to weapons grade 85 86 arguments for and against proliferationedit there has been much debate in the academic study of international security as to the advisability of proliferation in the late 1950s and early 1960s gen pierre marie gallois of france an adviser to charles degaulle argued in books like the balance of terror strategy for the nuclear age  1961 that mere possession of a nuclear arsenal what the french called the force de frappe was enough to ensure deterrence and thus concluded that the spread of nuclear weapons could increase international stability some very prominent neo-realist scholars such as kenneth waltz emeritus professor of political science at uc berkeley and adjunct senior research scholar at columbia university and john mearsheimer r wendell harrison distinguished service professor of political science at the university of chicago continue to argue along the lines of gallois though these scholars rarely acknowledge their intellectual debt to gallois and his contemporaries specifically these scholars advocate some forms of nuclear proliferation arguing that it will decrease the likelihood of war especially in troubled regions of the world aside from the majority opinion which opposes proliferation in any form there are two schools of thought on the matter those like mearsheimer who favor selective proliferation 87 and those such as waltz who advocate a laissez-faire attitude to programs like north koreas total proliferationedit in embryo waltz argues that the logic of mutually assured destruction mad should work in all security environments regardless of historical tensions or recent hostility he sees the cold war as the ultimate proof of mad logic the only occasion when enmity between two great powers did not result in military conflict this was he argues because nuclear weapons promote caution in decision-makers neither washington nor moscow would risk a nuclear apocalypse to advance territorial or power goals hence a peaceful stalemate ensued waltz and sagan  2003 p 24 waltz believes there to be no reason why this effect would not occur in all circumstances selective proliferationedit john mearsheimer would not support waltzs optimism in the majority of potential instances however he has argued for nuclear proliferation as policy in certain places such as postcold war europe in two famous articles professor mearsheimer opines that europe is bound to return to its precold war environment of regular conflagration and suspicion at some point in the future he advocates arming both germany and ukraine with nuclear weaponry in order to achieve a balance of power between these states in the east and franceuk in the west if this does not occur he is certain that war will eventually break out on the european continent 88 another separate argument against waltzs open proliferation and in favor of mearsheimers selective distribution is the possibility of nuclear terrorism some countries included in the aforementioned laissez-faire distribution could predispose the transfer of nuclear materials or a bomb falling into the hands of groups not affiliated with any governments such countries would not have the political will or ability to safeguard attempts at devices being transferred to a third party not being deterred by self-annihilation terrorism groups could push forth their own nuclear agendas or be used as shadow fronts to carry out the attack plans by mentioned unstable governments arguments against both positionsedit there are numerous arguments presented against both selective and total proliferation generally targeting the very neorealist assumptions such as the primacy of military security in state agendas the weakness of international institutions and the long-run unimportance of economic integration and globalization to state strategy its proponents tend to make with respect to mearsheimers specific example of europe many economists and neoliberals argue that the economic integration of europe through the development of the european union has made war in most of the european continent so disastrous economically so as to serve as an effective deterrent constructivists take this one step further frequently arguing that the development of eu political institutions has led or will lead to the development of a nascent european identity which most states on the european continent wish to partake in to some degree or another and which makes all states within or aspiring to be within the eu regard war between them as unthinkable as for waltz the general opinion is that most states are not in a position to safely guard against nuclear use that he underestimates the long-standing antipathy in many regions and that weak states will be unable to prevent  or will actively provide for  the disastrous possibility of nuclear terrorism waltz has dealt with all of these objections at some point in his work though to many he has not adequately responded betts  2000 the learning channel documentary doomsday on the brink illustrated 40 years of us and soviet nuclear weapons accidents even the 1995 norwegian rocket incident demonstrated a potential scenario in which russian democratization and military downsizing at the end of the cold war did not eliminate the danger of accidental nuclear war through command and control errors after asking might a future russian ruler or renegade russian general be tempted to use nuclear weapons to make foreign policy the documentary writers revealed a greater danger of russian security over its nuclear stocks but especially the ultimate danger of human nature to want the ultimate weapon of mass destruction to exercise political and military power future world leaders might not understand how close the soviets russians and americans were to doomsday how easy it all seemed because apocalypse was avoided for a mere 40 years between rivals politicians not terrorists who loved their children and did not want to die against 30,000 years of human prehistory history and military experts agree that proliferation can be slowed but never stopped technology cannot be uninvented 89 proliferation begets proliferationedit proliferation begets proliferation is a concept described by scott sagan in his article why do states build nuclear weapons this concept can be described as a strategic chain reaction if one state produces a nuclear weapon it creates almost a domino effect within the region states in the region will seek to acquire nuclear weapons to balance or eliminate the security threat sagan describes this reaction best in his article when he states every time one state develops nuclear weapons to balance against its main rival it also creates a nuclear threat to another region which then has to initiate its own nuclear weapons program to maintain its national security 90 going back through history we can see how this has taken place when the united states demonstrated that it had nuclear power capabilities after the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki the russians started to develop their program in preparation for the cold war with the russian military buildup france and the united kingdom perceived this as a security threat and therefore they pursued nuclear weapons sagan pg 71 iranedit former iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has been a frequent critic of the concept of nuclear apartheid as it has been put into practice by several countries particularly the united states in an interview with cnns christiane amanpour ahmadinejad said that iran was against nuclear apartheid which means some have the right to possess it use the fuel and then sell it to another country for 10 times its value were against that we say clean energy is the right of all countries but also it is the duty and the responsibility of all countries including ours to set up frameworks to stop the proliferation of it hours after that interview he spoke passionately in favor of irans right to develop nuclear technology claiming the nation should have the same liberties 91 iran is a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and claims that any work done in regards to nuclear technology is related only to civilian uses which is acceptable under the treaty iran violated its safeguards obligations under the treaty 92 by performing uranium-enrichment in secret after which the united nations security council ordered iran to suspend all uranium-enrichment until july 2015 93 indiaedit india has also been discussed in the context of nuclear apartheid india has consistently attempted to pass measures that would call for full international disarmament however they have not succeeded due to protests from those states that already have nuclear weapons in light of this india viewed nuclear weapons as a necessary right for all nations as long as certain states were still in possession of nuclear weapons india stated that nuclear issues were directly related to national security years before indias first underground nuclear test in 1998 the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty was passed some have argued that coercive language was used in an attempt to persuade india to sign the treaty which was pushed for heavily by neighboring china 94 india viewed the treaty as a means for countries that already had nuclear weapons primarily the five nations of the united nations security council to keep their weapons while ensuring that no other nations could develop them 95 see
