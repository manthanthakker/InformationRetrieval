demand factor in telecommunication electronics and the electrical power industry the term demand factor is used to refer to the fractional amount of some quantity being used relative to the maximum amount that could be used by the same system the demand factor is always less than or equal to one as the amount of demand is a time dependent quantity so is the demand factor f d e m a n d  t   demand maximum possible demand displaystyle fdemandit tfrac textdemandtextmaximum possible demand the demand factor is often implicitly averaged over time when the time period of demand is understood by the context electrical engineeringedit in electrical engineering the demand factor is taken as a time independent quantity where the numerator is taken as the maximum demand in the specified time period instead of the averaged or instantaneous demand the possible f d e m a n d  maximum load in given time period maximum possible load displaystyle fdemandfrac textmaximum load in given time periodtextmaximum possible load this is the peak in the load profile divided by the full load of the device example if a residence has equipment which would draw 6,000 w when all equipment was drawing a full load draw a maximum of 3,000 w in a specified time then the demand factor  3,000 w  6,000 w  0.5 this quantity is relevant when trying to establish the amount of load a system should be rated for in the above example it would be unlikely that the system would be rated to 6,000 w even though there may be a slight possibility that this amount of power can be drawn this is closely related to the load factor which is the average load divided by the peak load in a specified time period f l o a d  average load maximum load in given time period displaystyle floadfrac textaverage loadtextmaximum load in given time period see alsoedit capacity factor list of energy storage projects load factor electrical diversity factor referencesedit this article incorporatespublic domain material from the general services administration document federal standard 1037c in support of mil-std-188 v t e availability factor base load black start capacity factor demand factor demand management eroei fault grid storage intermittency load factor load following nameplate capacity peak demand power quality power-flow study repowering variability coal fossil-fuel power station natural gas petroleum nuclear oil shale biomass biofuel geothermal hydro marine current osmotic thermal tidal wave solar wind current osmotic thermal tidal wave ac power cogeneration combined cycle cooling tower induction generator micro chp microgeneration rankine cycle three-phase electric power virtual power plant blackout rolling blackout brownout demand response distributed generation dynamic demand electric power distribution electric power system electric power transmission electrical grid high-voltage direct current load management pumped hydro power station power storage smart grid substation super grid transformer transmission system operator tso transmission tower utility pole arc-faultcircuitinterrupter earth leakage circuit breaker residual-current device gfi power-system protection protective relay digital protective relay sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker carbon offset cost of electricity by source ecotax energy subsidies feed-in tariff fossil-fuel phase-out net metering pigovian tax renewable energy certificates renewable energy payments renewable energy policy spark spread
