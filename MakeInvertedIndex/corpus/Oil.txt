oil an oil is any neutral nonpolar chemical substance that is a viscous liquid at ambient temperatures and is both hydrophobic immiscible with water literally water fearing and lipophilic miscible with other oils literally fat loving oils have a high carbon and hydrogen content and are usually flammable and slippery the general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds that may be otherwise unrelated in structure properties and uses oils may be animal vegetable or petrochemical in origin and may be volatile or non-volatile 1 they are used for food fuel lubrication and the manufacture of paints plastics and other materials specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies as purifying agents  contents 1 etymology 2 types 2.1 organic oils 2.2 mineral oils 3

oile from latin oleum 2 which in turn comes from the greek ἔλαιον elaion olive oil oil 3 and that from ἐλαία elaia olive tree olive fruit 4 5 the earliest attested forms of the word are the mycenaean greek  e-ra-wo and  e-rai-wo written in the linear b syllabic script 6 types organic oils organic oils are produced in remarkable diversity by plants animals and other organisms through natural metabolic processes lipid is the scientific term for the fatty acids steroids and similar chemicals often found in the oils produced by living things while oil refers to an overall mixture of chemicals organic oils may also contain chemicals other than lipids including proteins waxes class of compounds with oil-like properties that are solid at common temperatures and alkaloids lipids can be classified by the way that they are made by an organism their chemical structure and their limited solubility in water compared to oils they have a high carbon and hydrogen content and are considerably lacking in oxygen compared to other organic compounds and minerals they tend to be relatively nonpolar molecules but may include both polar and nonpolar regions as in the case of phospholipids and steroids 7 mineral oils crude oil or petroleum and its refined components collectively termed petrochemicals are crucial resources in the modern economy crude oil originates from ancient fossilized organic materials such as zooplankton and algae which geochemical processes convert into oil 8 the name mineral oil is a misnomer in that minerals are not the source of the oilancient plants and animals are mineral oil is organic however it is classified as mineral oil instead of as organic oil because its organic origin is remote and was unknown at the time of its discovery and because it is obtained in the vicinity of rocks underground traps and sands mineral oil also refers to several specific distillates of crude oil applications cooking several edible vegetable and animal oils and also fats are used for various purposes in cooking and food preparation in particular many foods are fried in oil much hotter than boiling water oils are also used for flavoring and for modifying the texture of foods eg stir fry cooking oils are derived either from animal fat as butter lard and other types or plant oils from the olive maize sunflower and many other species cosmetics oils are applied to hair to give it a lustrous look to prevent tangles and roughness and to stabilize the hair to promote growth see hair conditioner religion oil has been used throughout history as a religious medium it is often considered a spiritually purifying agent and is used for anointing purposes as a particular example holy anointing oil has been an important ritual liquid for judaism and christianity painting color pigments are easily suspended in oil making it suitable as a supporting medium for paints the oldest known extant oil paintings date from 650 ad 9 heat transfer oils are used as coolants in oil cooling for instance in electric transformers heat transfer oils are used both as coolants see oil cooling for heating eg in oil heaters and in other applications of heat transfer lubrication given that they are non-polar oils do not easily adhere to other substances this makes them useful as lubricants for various engineering purposes mineral oils are more commonly used as machine lubricants than biological oils are whale oil is preferred for lubricating clocks because it does not evaporate leaving dust although its use was banned in 1980 10 it is a long-running myth that spermaceti from whales has still been used in nasa projects such as the hubble telescope and the voyager probe because of its extremely low freezing temperature spermaceti is not actually an oil but a mixture mostly of wax esters and there is no evidence that nasa has used whale oil 11 fuel some oils burn in liquid or aerosol form generating light and heat which can be used directly or converted into other forms of energy such as electricity or mechanical work to obtain many fuel oils crude oil is pumped from the ground and is shipped via oil tanker or a pipeline to an oil refinery there it is converted from crude oil to diesel fuel petrodiesel ethane and other short-chain alkanes fuel oils heaviest of commercial fuels used in shipsfurnaces gasoline petrol jet fuel kerosene benzene historically and liquefied petroleum gas a 42-gallon barrel us of crude oil produces approximately 10 gallons of diesel 4 gallons of jet fuel 19 gallons of gasoline 7 gallons of other products 3 gallons split between heavy fuel oil and liquified petroleum gases 12 and 2 gallons of heating oil the total production of a barrel of crude into various products results in an increase to 45 gallons 12 not all oils used as fuels are mineral oils see biodiesel and vegetable oil fuel in the 18th and 19th centuries whale oil was commonly used for lamps which was replaced with natural gas and then electricity 13 chemical feedstock crude oil can be refined into a wide variety of component hydrocarbons petrochemicals are the refined components of crude oil and the chemical products made from them they are used as detergents fertilizers medicines paints plastics synthetic fibers and synthetic rubber organic oils are another important chemical feedstock especially in green chemistry see also emulsifier a chemical which allows oil and water to mix references external links media related to oil at wikimedia commons petroleum online e-learning resource from ihrdc gnd
