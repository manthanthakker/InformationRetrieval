radio and its trademarked brand is npr it is known by both names 4 in june 2010 the organization announced that it was making a conscious effort to consistently refer to ourselves as npr on-air and

association of public radio stations 1980sedit npr suffered an almost fatal setback in 1983 when efforts to expand services created a deficit of nearly us$7 million after a congressional investigation and the resignation of nprs president frank mankiewicz the corporation for public broadcasting agreed to lend the network money in order to stave off bankruptcy 7 in exchange npr agreed to a new arrangement whereby the annual cpb stipend that it had previously received directly would be divided among local stations instead in turn those stations would support npr productions on a subscription basis npr also agreed to turn its satellite service into a cooperative venture the public radio satellite system making it possible for non-npr shows to get national distribution it took npr

totaled $180 million with the bulk of revenues coming from programming fees grants from foundations or business entities contributions and sponsorships 20 according to the 2009 financial statement about 50 of npr revenues come from the fees it charges member stations for programming and distribution charges 20 typically npr member stations receive funds through on-air pledge drives corporate underwriting state and local governments educational institutions and the federally funded corporation for public broadcasting cpb in 2009 member stations derived 6 of their revenue from federal state and local government funding 10 of their revenue from cpb grants and 14 of their revenue from universities 20 34 while npr does not receive any direct federal funding it does receive a small number of competitive grants from cpb and federal agencies like the department of education and the department of commerce this funding amounts to approximately 2 of nprs overall revenues 20 during the 1970s and early 1980s the majority of npr funding came from the federal government steps were taken during the 1980s to completely wean npr from government support but the 1983 funding crisis forced the network to make immediate changes according to cpb in 2009 11.3 of the aggregate revenues of all public radio broadcasting stations were funded from federal sources principally through cpb 35 in 2012 10.9 of the revenues for public radio came from federal sources 36 in 2011 npr announced the roll-out of their own online advertising network which allows member stations to run geographically

begin to increase revenue by having brands npr views as more relevant to the audience underwrite npr programs and requesting higher rates from them 39 underwriting spots vs commercialsedit in contrast with commercial broadcasting nprs radio broadcasts do not carry traditional commercials but has advertising in the form of brief statements from major sponsors which may include corporate slogans descriptions of products and services contact information such as website addresses and telephone numbers 40 these statements are called underwriting spots and unlike commercials are governed by specific fcc restrictions in addition to truth in advertising laws they cannot advocate a product or promote the goods and services of for-profit entities 41 these restrictions apply only to radio broadcasts and not nprs other digital platforms when questioned on the subject of how corporate underwriting revenues and foundation grants were holding up during the recession in a speech broadcast on c-span before the national press club on march 2 2009 then president and ceo vivian schiller stated underwriting is down its down for everybody this is the area that is most down for us in sponsorship underwriting advertising call it whatever you want just like it is for all of media 42 hosts of the npr program planet money stated the audience is indeed a product being sold to advertisers in the same way as commercial stations saying they are not advertisers exactly but they have a lot of the same characteristics lets just say that 43 audienceedit a harris telephone survey

ratings and rankings such as radio  records however npr station listenership is measured by arbitron in both diary and ppm people meter markets npr stations are frequently not included in summary level diary data used by most advertising agencies for media planning data on npr listening can be accessed using respondent level diary data additionally all radio stations public and commercial are treated equally within the ppm data sets making npr station listenership data much more widely available to the media planning community according to arbitrons national broadcast audience estimate

programs can occasionally be heard on these stations as well additionally npr member stations distribute a series of podcast-only programs such as planet money on gambling with mike pesca groove salad and youthcast which are designed for younger audiences controversiesedit over the course of nprs history controversies have arisen over several incidents and topics allegations of ideological biasedit npr has been accused of displaying both liberal bias as alleged in work such as a ucla and university of missouri study of morning edition and conservative bias including criticism of alleged reliance on conservative think-tanks 58 npr has also been accused of bias related to specific topics including support of the 2003 invasion of iraq and coverage of israel the npr ombudsman has described how nprs coverage of the israel-palestinian conflict has been simultaneously criticized as biased by both sides 59 university of texas journalism professor and author robert jensen has criticized npr as taking a pro-war stance during coverage of iraq war protests 60 in 2002 and 2003 surveys and follow-up focus groups conducted by the tarrance group and lake snell perry  associates have indicated that the majority of the us adult population does not believe that the news and information programming on public broadcasting is biased the plurality of americans indicate that there is no apparent bias one way or the other while approximately two-in-ten detect a liberal bias and approximately one-in-ten detect a conservative bias 61 euphemismsedit in a controversial act npr banned in 2009 the use of the word torture in the context of the bush administrations use of enhanced interrogation techniques 62 nprs ombudswoman alicia shepards defense of the policy was that calling waterboarding torture is tantamount to taking sides 63 but berkeley professor of linguistics geoffrey nunberg pointed out that virtually all media around the world other than what he called the spineless us media call these techniques torture 64 65 in an article which criticized npr and other us media for their use of euphemisms for torture glenn greenwald discussed what he called the enabling corruption of american journalism this active media complicity in concealing that our government created a systematic torture regime by refusing ever to say so is one of the principal reasons it was allowed to happen for so long the steadfast ongoing refusal of our leading media institutions to refer to what the bush administration did as torture even in the face of more than 100 detainee deaths the use of that term by a leading bush official to describe what was done at guantanamo and the fact that media outlets frequently use the word torture to describe exactly the same methods when used by other countries --reveals much about how the modern journalist thinks 66 live from death row commentariesedit in 1994 npr arranged to air on all things considered a series of three-minute commentaries by mumia abu-jamal a journalist convicted in a controversial trial of murdering a philadelphia police officer they cancelled airing them after the fraternal order of police and members of the us congress objected 67 juan williams commentsedit on october 20 2010 npr terminated senior news analyst juan williamss independent contract 68 over a series of incidents culminating in remarks he made on the fox news channel regarding muslims ronald schiller commentsedit in march 2011 conservative political activist and provocateur james okeefe sent partners simon templar a pen name and shaughn adeleye 69 to secretly record their discussion with ronald schiller nprs outgoing senior vice president for fundraising and an associate in which schiller made remarks viewed as disparaging of the current republican party especially the tea party and controversial comments regarding palestine and funding for npr npr disavowed schillers comments ceo vivian schiller who is not related to ronald later
