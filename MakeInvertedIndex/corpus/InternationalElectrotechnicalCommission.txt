commission 1 iec in french commission électrotechnique internationale cei is a non-profit non-governmental international standards organization that prepares and publishes international standards for all electrical electronic and related technologies  collectively known as electrotechnology iec standards cover a vast range of technologies from power generation transmission and distribution to home appliances and office equipment semiconductors fibre optics batteries solar energy nanotechnology and marine energy as well as many others the iec also manages three global conformity assessment systems that certify whether equipment system or components conform to its international standards the iec charter embraces all electrotechnologies including energy production and distribution electronics magnetics and electromagnetics electroacoustics multimedia telecommunication and medical technology as well as associated general disciplines such as terminology and symbols electromagnetic compatibility by its advisory committee on electromagnetic compatibility acec measurement and performance dependability design and development safety and the environment  contents 1

institution of electrical engineers the american institute of electrical engineers and others which began at the 1900 paris international electrical congress and continued with colonel r e b crompton playing a key role the iec was instrumental in developing and distributing standards for units of measurement particularly gauss hertz and webercitation needed it also first proposed a system of standards the giorgi system which ultimately became the si or système international dunités in english the international system of units in 1938 it published a multilingual international vocabulary to unify terminology relating to electrical electronic and related technologies this effort continues and the international electrotechnical vocabulary the on-line version of which is known as the electropedia remains an important work in the electrical and electronic industries the cispr comité international spécial des perturbations radioélectriques  in english the international special committee on radio interference  is one of the groups founded by the iec currently 82 countries are members while another 82 participate in the affiliate country programme which is not a form of membership but is designed to help industrializing countries get involved with the iec originally located in london the commission moved to its current headquarters in geneva in 1948 it has regional centres in asia-pacific singapore latin america são paulo brazil and north america boston united states today the iec is the worlds leading international organization in its field and its standards are adopted as national standards by its members the work is done by some 10,000 electrical and electronics experts from industry government academia test labs and others with an interest in the subject iec standardsedit iec standards have numbers in the range 60000–79999 and their titles take a form such as iec 60417 graphical symbols for use on equipment the numbers of older iec standards were converted in 1997 by adding 60000 for example iec 27 became iec 60027 the iec cooperates closely with the international organization for standardization iso and the international telecommunication union itu in addition it works with several major standards development organizations including the ieee with which it signed a cooperation agreement in 2002 which was amended in 2008 to include joint development work standards developed jointly with iso such as isoiec 26300 open document format for office applications opendocument v1.0 carry the acronym of both organizations the use of the isoiec prefix covers publications from isoiec joint technical committee 1 - information technology as well as conformity assessment standards developed by iso casco and iec cab conformity assessment board other standards developed in cooperation between iec and iso are assigned numbers in the 80000 series such as iec 82045-1 the 60000 series of standards are also found preceded by en to indicate the iec standards harmonized as european standards for example iec 60034 would be en 60034 iec standards are also being adopted as harmonized standards by other certifying bodies such as bsi united kingdom csa canada ul  ansiincits united states sabs south africa sai australia spcgb china and din germany iec standards harmonized by other certifying bodies generally have some noted differences from the original iec standard 2 membership and participationedit the iec is made up of members called national committees and each nc represents its nations electrotechnical interests in the iec this includes manufacturers providers distributors and vendors consumers and users all levels of governmental agencies professional societies and trade associations as well as standards developers from national standards bodies national committees are constituted in different ways some ncs are public sector only some are a combination of public and private sector and some are private sector only about 90 of those who prepare iec standards work in industry iec member countries include 3 full membersedit algeria argentina  instituto argentino de normalización y

national committee directorate for standards and quality stameq affiliatesedit in 2001 and in response to calls from the wto to open itself to more developing nations the iec launched the affiliate country programme to encourage developing nations to become involved in the commissions work or to use its international standards countries signing a pledge to participate in the work and to encourage the use of iec standards in national standards and regulations are granted access to a limited number of technical committee documents for the purposes of commenting in addition they can select a limited number of iec standards for their national standards library countries as of 2011 participating in the affiliate country programme are 8 afghanistan angola antigua and barbuda armenia
