1973 oil crisis the 1973 oil crisis began in october 1973 when the members of the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries proclaimed an oil embargo by the end of the embargo in march 1974 1 the price of oil had risen from us$3 per barrel to nearly $12 globally us prices were significantly higher the embargo caused an oil crisis or shock with many short- and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy 2 it was later called the first oil shock followed by the 1979 oil crisis termed the second oil shock contents 1 summary 2 background 2.1 us oil production decline 2.2

summaryedit the embargo was a response to american involvement in the 1973 yom kippur war six days after egypt and syria launched a surprise military campaign against israel the us supplied israel with arms in response to this the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries oapec consisting of the arab members of opec plus egypt and syria announced an oil embargo against canada japan the netherlands the united kingdom and the united states 3 the crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within nato some european nations and japan sought to disassociate themselves from united states foreign policy in the middle east to avoid being targeted by the boycott arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents to address this the nixon administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants they arranged for israel to pull back from the sinai peninsula and the golan heights by january 18 1974 us secretary of state henry kissinger had negotiated an israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the sinai peninsula the promise of a negotiated settlement between israel and syria was enough to convince arab oil producers to lift the embargo in march 1974 1 independently oapec members agreed to use their leverage over the world price-setting mechanism for oil to stabilize their incomes by raising world oil prices after the recent failure of negotiations with western oil companies the embargo occurred at a time of rising petroleum consumption by industrialized countries and coincided with a sharp increase in oil imports by the worlds largest oil consumer the united states in the aftermath targeted countries initiated a wide variety of policies to contain their future dependency the 1973 oil price shock with the accompanying 1973–74 stock market crash were regarded as the first discrete event since the great depression to have a persistent effect on the us economy 4 the embargos success demonstrated saudi arabias diplomatic and economic power it was the largest oil exporter and a politically and religiously conservative kingdom backgroundedit us oil production declineedit in 1970 us oil production started to decline exacerbating the embargos impact 5 following this nixon named james e akins as us ambassador to saudi arabia to audit us production capacity the confidential results were alarmingno spare capacity was available and production could only decrease the oil embargo had little effect on overall supply according to akins 6 opecedit the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec which then comprised 12 countries including iran seven arab countries iraq kuwait libya qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates plus venezuela indonesia nigeria and ecuador was formed at a baghdad conference on september 14 1960 opec was organized to resist pressure by the seven sisters seven large western oil companies to reduce oil prices at first opec operated as an informal bargaining unit for resource-rich third-world countries opec confined its activities to gaining a larger share of the profits generated by oil companies and greater control over member production levels in the early 1970s it began to exert economic and political strength the oil companies and importing nations suddenly faced a unified exporter bloc end of the bretton woods currency accordedit on august 15 1971 the united states unilaterally pulled out of the bretton woods accord the us abandoned the gold exchange standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar whose value was left to float rise and fall according to market demand 7 shortly thereafter britain followed floating the pound sterling the other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time the industrialized nations increased their reserves by expanding their money supplies in amounts far greater than before the result was a depreciation of thedollar and other industrialized nations currencies because oil was priced in dollars oil producers real income decreased in september 1971 opec issued a joint communiqué stating that from then on they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold 8 this contributed to the oil shock after 1971 opec was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation from 1947 to 1967 the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year until the oil shock the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities opec ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions so their real incomes lagged the substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to bretton woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold 9 yom kippur waredit on october 6 1973 syria and egypt with support from other arab nations launched a surprise attack on israel on yom kippur 10 this renewal of hostilities in the arabisraeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices at the time iran was the worlds second-largest oil exporter and a close us ally weeks later the shah of iran said in an interview of course the price of oil is going to rise certainly and how youve western nations increased the price of the wheat you sell us by 300 percent and the same for sugar and cement you buy our crude oil and sell it back to us refined as petrochemicals at a hundred times the price youve paid us its only fair that from now on you should pay more for oil lets say ten times more 11 on october 12 1973 us president richard nixon authorized operation nickel grass a strategic airlift to deliver weapons and supplies to israel after the soviet union began sending arms to syria and egypt embargoedit in response to american aid to israel on october 16 1973 opec raised the posted price of oil by 70 to $5.11 a barrel 12 the following day oil ministers agreed to the embargo a cut in production by five percent from septembers output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met 13 on october 19 nixon requested congress to appropriate $2.2billion in emergency aid to israel including $1.5billion in outright grants george lenczowski notes military supplies did not exhaust nixons eagerness to prevent israels collapsethis $2.2billion decision triggered a collective opec response 14 libya immediately announced it would embargo oil shipments to the united states 15 saudi arabia and the other arab oil-producing states joined the embargo on october 20 1973 16 at their kuwait meeting oapec proclaimed the embargo that curbed exports to various countries and blocked all oil deliveries to the us as a principal hostile country 14 price increases were also imposed greatly since short-term oil demand is inelastic immediate demand falls little when the price rises thus market prices rose from $3 per barrel to $12 per barrel to reduce demand to the new lower level of supply 17 the world financial system which was already under pressure from the bretton woods breakdown was set on a path of recessions and inflation that persisted until the early 1980s with oil prices remaining elevated until 1986 over the long term the oil embargo changed the nature of policy in the west towards increased exploration alternative energy research energy conservation and more restrictive monetary policy to better fight inflation 18 chronologyedit january 1973the 1973–74 stock market crash commences as a result of inflation pressure and the collapsing monetary system august 23 1973in preparation for the yom kippur war saudi king faisal and egyptian president anwar sadat meet in riyadh and secretly negotiate an accord whereby the

31diplomacy by kissinger produces a disengagement agreement on the syrian front december 1974the 1973–74 stock market crash ends effectsedit immediate economic effectsedit the effects of the embargo were immediate opec forced oil companies to increase payments drastically the price of oil quadrupled by 1974 to nearly us$12 per barrel  75 usm3 2 this price increase had a dramatic effect on oil exporting nations for the countries of the middle east who had long been dominated by the industrial powers seen to have taken control of a vital commodity the oil-exporting nations began to accumulate vast wealth some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities amid shrinking western demand much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions particularly in the middle east saudi arabia spent over 100 billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of islam known as wahhabism throughout the world via religious charities such al-haramain foundation which often also distributed funds to violent sunni extremist groups such as al-qaeda and the taliban 21 control of oil became known as the oil weapon it came in the form of an embargo and production cutbacks from the arab states the weapon was aimed at the united states great britain canada japan and the netherlands these target governments perceived that the intent was to push them towards a more pro-arab position 22 production was eventually cut by 25 23 however the affected countries did not undertake dramatic policy changes 24 in the united states scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973 the possibility that the middle east could become another superpower confrontation with the ussr was of more concern to the us than oil further interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for kissingers dominance 25 in the us production distribution and price disruptions have been held responsible for recessions periods of excessive inflation reduced productivity and lower economic growth 26 the embargo had a negative influence on the us economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to usenergy security 27 on an international level the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries such as automobiles macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts 28 the embargo left oilcompanies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies even in rugged terrain such as the arctic finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to tenyears before significant production 29 opec-member states raised the prospect of nationalization of oil company holdings most notably saudi arabia nationalized aramco in 1980 under the leadership of saudi oil minister ahmed zaki yamani as other opec nations followed suit the cartels income soared saudi arabia undertook a series of ambitious five-year development plans the biggest began in 1980 funded at $250billion other cartel members also undertook major economic development programs us retail price gas prices rose from a national average of 38.5cents in may 1973 to 55.1cents in june 1974 state governments requested citizens not to put up christmas lights oregon banned christmas and commercial lighting altogether 17 politicians called for a national gas rationing program 30 nixon requested gasoline stations to voluntarily not sell gasoline on saturday nights or sundays 90 of owners complied which produced long queues 17 the embargo was not uniform across europe of the nine members of the european economic community eec the netherlands faced a complete embargo the uk and france received almost uninterrupted supplies having refused to allow america to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the arabs and the israelis while the other six faced partial cutbacks the uk had traditionally been an ally of israel and harold wilsons government supported the israelis during the six-day war his successor ted heath reversed this policy in 1970 calling for israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders the eec was unable to achieve a common policy during the first month of the war it issued a statement on november 6 after the embargo and price rises had begun it was widely viewed as pro-arab supporting the franco-british line on the war opec duly lifted its embargo from all eec members the price rises had a much greater impact in europe than the embargo despite being relatively unaffected by the embargo the uk nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its owna series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of 1973–74 became a major factor in the change of government 31 heath asked the british to heat only one room in their houses over the winter 32 the uk germany italy switzerland and norway banned flying driving and boating on sundays sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil the netherlands imposed prison sentences for those who used more than their ration of electricity 17 a few months later the crisis eased the embargo was lifted in march 1974 after negotiations at the washington oil summit but the effects lingered throughout the 1970s the dollar price of energy increased again the following year amid the weakening competitive position of the dollar in world markets price controls and rationingedit united statesedit price controls exacerbated the crisis in the us the system limited the price of old oil that which had already been discovered while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment predictably old oil was withdrawn from the market creating greater scarcity the rule also discouraged development of alternative energies 30 the rule had been intended to promote oil exploration 33 scarcity was addressed by rationing as in many countries motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973 30 in 1973 nixon named william e simon as the first administrator of the federal energy office a short-term organization created to coordinate the response to the embargo 34 simon allocated states the same amount of domestic oil for 1974 that each had consumed in 1972 which worked for states whose populations were not increasing 35 in other states lines at gasoline stations were common the american automobile association reported that in the last week of february 1974 20 of american gasoline stations had no fuel 35 oddeven rationing allowed vehicles with license plates having an odd number as the last digit or a vanity license plate to buy gas only on odd-numbered days of the month while others could buy only on even-numbered days 36 in some states a three-color flag system was used to denote gasoline availability at service stationsgreen for unrationed availability yellow for restrictedrationed sales and red for out of stock 37 rationing led to violent incidents when truck drivers chose to strike for two days in december 1973 over the limited supplies simon had allocated for their industry in pennsylvania and ohio non-striking truckers were shot at by striking truckers and in arkansas trucks of non-strikers were attacked with bombs 35 america had controlled the price of natural gas since the 1950s with the inflation of the 1970s the price was too low to encourage the search for new reserves 38 americas natural gas reserves dwindled from 237 trillion in 1974 to 203 trillionclarification needed in 1978 the price controls were not changed despite president gerald fords repeated requests to congress 38 conservation and reduction in demandedit united statesedit to help reduce consumption in 1974 a national maximum speed limit of 55mph about 88kmh was imposed through the emergency highway energy conservation act development of the strategic petroleum reserve began in 1975 and in 1977 the cabinet-level department of energy was created followed by the national energy act of 1978citation needed on november 28 1995 bill clinton signed the national highway designation act ending the federal 55 mph  89 kmh speed limit allowing states to restore their prior maximum speed limit year-round daylight saving time was implemented from january 6 1974 to february 23 1975 the move spawned significant criticism because it forced many children to travel to school before sunrise the prior rules were restored in 1976citation needed the crisis prompted a call to conserve energy most notably a campaign by the advertising council using the tagline dont be fuelish 39 many newspapers carried advertisements featuring cut-outs that could be attached to light switches reading last out lights out dont be fuelishcitation needed by 1980 domestic luxury cars with a 130-inch  3.3m wheelbase and gross weights averaging 4,500pounds  2,041kg were no longer made the automakers had begun phasing out the traditional front enginerear wheel drive layout in compact cars in favor of lighter front enginefront wheel drive designs a higher percentage of cars offered more efficient 4-cylinder engines domestic auto makers also began offering more fuel efficient diesel powered passenger cars as well though not regulated by the new legislation auto racing groups voluntarily began conserving in 1974 the 24 hours of daytona was cancelled and nascar reduced all race distances by 10 the 12 hours of sebring race was cancelledcitation needed in 1976 congress created the weatherization assistance program to help low-income homeowners and renters reduce their demand for heating and cooling through better insulationcitation needed alternative energy sourcesedit the energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels 40 there is criticism that american energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient but whose prospects are doubtful 41 the brazilian government implemented its proálcool pro-alcohol project in 1975 that mixed ethanol with gasoline for automotive fuel 42 israel was one of the few countries unaffected by the embargo since it could extract sufficient oil from the sinai but to supplement israels over-taxed power grid harry zvi tabor the father of israels solar industry developed the prototype for a solar water heater now used in over 90 of israeli homes 43 macroeconomyedit the crisis was a major factor in shifting japans economy away from oil-intensive industries investment shifted to industries such as electronics japanese auto makers also benefited from the crisis increased fuel costs allowed their small fuel-efficient models to gain market share from the gas-guzzling american competition this triggered a drop in american auto sales that lasted into the 1980s western central banks decided to sharply cut interest rates to encourage growth deciding that inflation was a secondary concern although this was the orthodox macroeconomic prescription at the time the resulting stagflation surprised economists and central bankers the policy is now considered by some to have deepened and lengthened the adverse effects of the embargo recent research claims that in the period after 1985 the economy became more resilient to energy price increases 44 the price shock created large current account deficits in oil-importing economies a petrodollar recycling mechanism was created through which opec surplus funds were channeled through the capital markets to the west to finance the current account deficits the functioning of this mechanism required the relaxation of capital controls in oil-importing economies it marked the beginning of an exponential growth of western capital markets 45 many in the public remain suspicious of oil companies believing they profiteered or even colluded with opeccitation needed in 1974 seven of the fifteen top fortune 500 companies were oil companies falling to four in 2014 46 international relationsedit united statesedit americas cold war policies suffered a major blow from the embargo they had focused on china and the soviet union but the latent challenge to us hegemony coming from the third world became evident in 2004 declassified documents revealed that the us was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize middle eastern oilfields in late 1973 although no explicit plan was mentioned a conversation between us secretary of defense james schlesinger and british ambassador to the united states lord cromer revealed schlesinger had told him that it was no longer obvious to him that the us could not use force british prime minister edward heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a british intelligence estimate of us intentions which concluded america might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the us and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in saudi arabia and kuwait and possibly abu dhabi in military action was decided upon although the soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force intelligence warned the american occupation would need to last 10 years as the west developed alternative energy sources and would result in the total alienation of the arabs and much of the rest of the third world 47 natoedit western europe began switching from pro-israel to more pro-arab policies 48 49 50 this change strained the western alliance the us which imported only 12 of its oil from the middle east compared with 80 for the europeans and over 90 for japan remained staunchly committed to israel the percentage of usoil which comes from the nations bordering the persian gulf remained steady over the decades with a figure of a little more than 10 in 2008 51 with the embargo in place many developed countries altered their policies regarding the arab-israeli conflict these included the uk which refused to allow the united states to use british bases and cyprus to airlift resupplies to israel along with the rest of the members of the european community 52 canada shifted towards a more pro-arab position after displeasure was expressed towards canadas mostly neutral position on the other hand after the embargo the canadian government moved quickly indeed toward the arab position despite its low dependence on middle eastern oil 53 japanedit although lacking historical connections to the middle east japan was the country most dependent on arab oil 71 of its imported oil came from the middle east in 1970 on november 7 1973 the saudi and kuwaiti governments declared japan a nonfriendly country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy it received a 5 production cut in december causing a panic on november 22 japan issued a statement asserting that israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories advocating palestinian self-determination and threatening to reconsider its policy toward israel if israel refused to accept these preconditions 53 by december 25 japan was considered an arab-friendly state nonaligned nationsedit the oil embargo was announced roughly one month after a right-wing military coup in chile led by general augusto pinochet toppled socialist president salvador allende on september 11 1973 the response of the nixon administration was to propose doubling arms sales as a consequence an opposing latin american bloc was organized and financed in part by venezuelan oil revenues which quadrupled between 1970 and 1975 a year after the start of the embargo the uns nonaligned bloc passed a resolution demanding the creation of a new international economic order under which nations within the global south would receive a greater share of benefits derived from the exploitation of southern resources and greater control over their self-development 54 arab statesedit prior to the embargo the geo-political competition between the soviet union and the united states in combination with low oil prices that hindered the necessity and feasibility of alternative energy sources presented the arab states with financial security moderate economic growth and disproportionate international bargaining power 55 the oil shock disrupted the status quo relationships between arab countries and the us and ussr at the time egypt syria and iraq were allied with the ussr while saudi arabia turkey and iran plus israel aligned with the us vacillations in alignment often resulted in greater support from the respective superpowers when anwar sadat became president of egypt in 1970 he dismissed soviet specialists in egypt and reoriented towards the us concerns over economic domination from increased soviet oil production turned into fears of military aggression after the 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan turning the persian gulf states towards the us for security guarantees against soviet military action the ussrs invasion of afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region also marked by increased american weapons sales technology and outright military presence saudi arabia and iran became increasingly dependent on american security assurances to manage both external and internal threats including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues both states were competing for preeminence in the persian gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries by 1979 saudi arms purchases from the us exceeded five times israels 56 another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the us by saudi arabia was the failure of the shah during january 1979 to maintain control of iran a non-arabic but largely shiite muslim nation which fell to a theocratic islamist government under the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in the wake of the 1979 iranian revolution saudi arabia on the other hand is an arab largely sunni muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy in the wake of the iranian revolution the saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of islamism a reality which would quickly be revealed in the grand mosque seizure in mecca by wahhabi extremists during november 1979 and a shiite revolt in the oil rich al-hasa region of saudi arabia in december of the same year 57 in november 2010 wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the united states and its allies which revealed that the late saudi king abdullah urged the united states to attack iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program describing iran as a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination 58 automobile industryedit the oil crisis sent a signal to the auto industry globally which changed many aspects of production and usage for decades to come western europeedit after world war ii most west european countries taxed motor fuel to limit imports and as a result most cars made in europe were smaller and more economical than their american counterparts by the late 1960s increasing incomes supported rising car sizes the oil crisis pushed west european car buyers away from larger less economical cars 59 the most notable result of this transition was the rise in popularity of compact hatchbacks the only notable small hatchbacks built in western europe before the oil crisis were the peugeot 104 renault 5 and fiat 127 by the end of the decade the market had expanded with the introduction of the ford fiesta opel kadett sold as the vauxhall astra in great britain chrysler sunbeam and citroën visa buyers looking for larger cars were increasingly drawn to medium-sized hatchbacks virtually unknown in europe in 1973 by the end of the decade they were gradually replacing saloons as the mainstay of this sector between 1973 and 1980 medium-sized hatchbacks were launched across europe the chryslersimca horizon fiat ritmo strada in the uk ford escort mk3 renault 14 volvo 340  360 opel kadett and volkswagen golf these cars were considerably more economical than the traditional saloons they were replacing and attracted buyers who traditionally bought larger vehicles some 15years after the oil crisis hatchbacks dominated most european small and medium car markets and had gained a substantial share of the large family car market united statesedit before the energy crisis large heavy and powerful cars were popular by 1971 the standard engine in a chevrolet caprice was a 400-cubic inch  6.5liter v8 the wheelbase of this car was 121.5 inches  3,090mm and motor trends 1972 road test of the similar chevrolet impala achieved no more than 15highway miles per gallon the crisis reduced the demand for large cars 38 japanese imports primarily the toyota corona the toyota corolla the datsun b210 the datsun 510 the honda civic the mitsubishi galant a captive import from chrysler sold as the dodge colt the subaru dl and later the honda accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical american v8 and six cylinder engines japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive which became de facto standards from europe the volkswagen beetle the volkswagen fastback the renault 8 the renault lecar and the fiat brava were successful detroit responded with the ford pinto the ford maverick the chevrolet vega the chevrolet nova the plymouth valiant and the plymouth volaré american motors sold its homegrown gremlin hornet and pacer models some buyers lamented the small size of the first japanese compacts and both toyota and nissan then known as datsun introduced larger cars such as the toyota corona markii the toyota cressida the mazda 616 and datsun 810 which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning power steering am-fm radios and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle a decade after the 1973 oil crisis honda toyota and nissan affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints opened us assembly plants and established their luxury divisions acura lexus and infiniti respectively to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands compact trucks were introduced such as the toyota hilux and the datsun truck followed by the mazda truck sold as the ford courier and the isuzu-built chevrolet luv mitsubishi rebranded its forte as the dodge d-50 a few years after the oil crisis mazda mitsubishi and isuzu had joint partnerships with ford chrysler and gm respectively later the american makers introduced their domestic replacements ford ranger dodge dakota and the chevrolet s10gmc s-15 ending their captive import policy an increase in imported cars into north america forced general motors ford and chrysler to introduce smaller and fuel-efficient models for domestic sales the dodge omni  plymouth horizon from chrysler the ford fiesta and the chevrolet chevette all had four-cylinder engines and room for at least four passengers by the late 1970s by 1985 the average american vehicle moved 17.4miles per gallon compared to 13.5 in 1970 the improvements stayed even though the price of a barrel of oil remained constant at $12 from 1974 to 1979 38 sales of large sedans for most makes except chrysler products recovered within two model years of the 1973 crisis the cadillac deville and fleetwood buick electra oldsmobile 98 lincoln continental mercury marquis and various other luxury oriented sedans became popular again in the mid-1970s the only full-size models that did not recover were lower price models such as the chevrolet bel air and ford galaxie 500 slightly smaller mid-size models such as the oldsmobile cutlass chevrolet monte carlo ford thunderbird and various other models sold well economical imports succeeded alongside heavy expensive vehicles in 1976 toyota sold 346,920 cars average weight around 2,100lbs while cadillac sold 309,139 cars average weight around 5,000lbs federal safety standards such as nhtsa federal motor vehicle safety standard 215 pertaining to safety bumpers and compacts like the 1974 mustang i were a prelude to the dot downsize revision of vehicle categories 60 by 1977 gms full-sized cars reflected the crisis 61 by 1979 virtually all full-size american cars had shrunk featuring smaller engines and smaller outside dimensions chrysler ended production of their full-sized luxury sedans at the end of the 1981 model year moving instead to a full front-wheel drive lineup for 1982 except for the m-body dodge diplomatplymouth gran fury and chrysler new yorker fifth avenue sedans decline of opecedit opec soon lost its
