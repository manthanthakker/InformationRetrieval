location between europe and asia has retained its geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history 10 11 turkey has been inhabited since the paleolithic 12 by various ancient anatolian civilizations as well as assyrians greeks thracians phrygians urartians and armenians 13 14 15 after alexander the greats conquest the area was hellenized a process which continued under the roman empire and its transition into the byzantine empire 14 16 the seljuk turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century starting the process of turkification which was accelerated by the seljuk victory over the byzantines at the battle of manzikert in 1071 17 the seljuk sultanate of rûm ruled anatolia until the mongol invasion in 1243 when it disintegrated into small turkish beyliks 18 in the mid-14th century the ottomans started uniting anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of southeastern europe western asia and north africa becoming a major power in eurasia and africa during the early modern period the empire reached the peak of its power in the 16th century especially during the reign  1520–1566 of suleiman the magnificent the empire remained powerful and influential for two more centuries until important setbacks such as the great turkish war  1683–99 and the russo-turkish war  1768–74 forced it to cede strategic territories in europe signalling the loss of its former military strength and wealth the tanzimat reforms of the 19th century which aimed to modernize the ottoman state proved to be inadequate in most fields and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire 19 suspended by sultan abdülhamid ii in 1878 the ottoman constitution and parliament were restored with the young turk revolution on 24 july 1908 taking advantage of the chaos bulgaria formally declared its independence on 5 october 1908 and austria-hungary formally annexed bosnia-herzegovina on 6 october 1908 the italo-turkish war  1911–1912 encouraged the balkan league to declare the balkan wars  1912–1913 which caused the ottoman empire to lose the majority of its remaining territories in europe and triggered the largest ethnic cleansing of turks in the balkan peninsula since the russo-turkish war  1877–78 resulting in the mass migrations of turks to anatolia the disappointment in these losses led to the 1913 ottoman coup détat which effectively put the country under the control of the three pashas who decided to join the central powers of world war i  1914–1918 which were ultimately defeated by the allied powers during the war the ottoman government committed ethnic cleansing or genocide against its armenian assyrian and pontic greek citizens 20 following the war the conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the ottoman empire was divided into several new states 21 the turkish war of independence  1919–1922 initiated by mustafa kemal atatürk and his colleagues in anatolia against the occupying allies resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the modern republic of turkey in 1923 with atatürk as its first president 22 turkeys official language is turkish a turkic language spoken

the first recorded use of the term türk or türük as an autonym is contained in the old turkic inscriptions of the göktürks celestial turks of central asia c 8th century 30 the english name turkey first appeared in the late 14th century and is derived from medieval latin turchia 31 the greek cognate of this name tourkia greek τουρκία was used by the byzantine emperor and scholar constantine vii porphyrogenitus in his book de administrando imperio 32 33 though in his use turks always referred to magyars 34 similarly the medieval khazar empire a turkic state on the northern shores of the black and caspian seas was referred to as tourkia land of the turks in byzantine sources 35 the ottoman empire was sometimes referred to as turkey or the turkish empire among its contemporaries 36 history prehistory of anatolia and eastern thrace the anatolian peninsula comprising most of modern turkey is one of the oldest permanently settled regions in the world various ancient anatolian populations have lived in anatolia from at least the neolithic period until the hellenistic period 14 many of these peoples spoke the anatolian languages a branch of the larger indo-european language family 39 in fact given the antiquity of the indo-european hittite and luwian languages some scholars have proposed anatolia as the hypothetical center from which the indo-european languages radiated 40 the european part of turkey called eastern thrace has also been inhabited since at least forty thousand years ago and is known to have been in the neolithic era by about 6000 bc 15 göbekli tepe is the site of the oldest known man-made religious structure a temple dating to 10,000 bc 41 while çatalhöyük is a very large neolithic and chalcolithic settlement in southern anatolia which existed from approximately 7500 bc to 5700 bc it is the largest and best-preserved neolithic site found to date and in july 2012 was inscribed as a unesco world heritage site 42 the settlement of troy started in the neolithic age and continued into the iron age 43 the earliest recorded inhabitants of anatolia were the hattians and hurrians non-indo-european peoples who inhabited central and eastern anatolia respectively as early as ca 2300 bc indo-european hittites came to anatolia and gradually absorbed the hattians and hurrians ca 2000–1700 bc the first major empire in the area was founded by the hittites from the 18th through the 13th century bc the assyrians conquered and settled parts of southeastern turkey as early as 1950 bc until the year 612 bc 44 45 urartu re-emerged in assyrian inscriptions in the 9th century bc as a powerful northern rival of assyria 46 following the collapse of the hittite empire c 1180 bc the phrygians an indo-european people achieved ascendancy in anatolia until their kingdom was destroyed by the cimmerians in the 7th century bc 47 starting from 714bc urartu shared the same fate and dissolved in 590 bc 48 when it was conquered by the medes the most powerful of phrygias successor states were lydia caria and lycia antiquity and byzantine period starting around 1200 bc the coast of anatolia was heavily settled by aeolian and ionian greeks numerous important cities were founded by these colonists such as miletus ephesus smyrna now i̇zmir and byzantium now istanbul the latter founded by greek colonists from megara in 657 bc the first state that was called armenia by neighbouring peoples was the state of the armenian orontid dynasty which included parts of eastern turkey beginning in the 6th century bc in northwest turkey the most significant tribal group in thrace was the odyrisians founded by teres i 49 all of modern-day turkey was conquered by the persian achaemenid empire during the 6th century bc 50 the greco-persian wars started when the greek city states on the coast of anatolia rebelled against persian rule in 499 bc the territory of turkey later fell to alexander the great in 334 bc 51 which led to increasing cultural homogeneity and hellenization in the area 14 following alexanders death in 323 bc anatolia was subsequently divided into a number of small hellenistic kingdoms all of which became part of the roman republic by the mid-1st century bc 52 the process of hellenization that began with alexanders conquest accelerated under roman rule and by the early centuries ad the local anatolian languages and cultures had become extinct being largely replaced by ancient greek language and culture 16 53 from the 1st century bc up to the 3rd century ad large parts of modern-day turkey were contested between the romans and neighboring parthians through the frequent roman-parthian wars in 324 constantine i chose byzantium to be the new capital of the roman empire renaming it new rome following the death of theodosius i in 395 and the permanent division of the roman empire between his two sons the city which would popularly come to be known as constantinople became the capital of the eastern roman empire this which would later be branded by historians as the byzantine empire ruled most of the territory of present-day turkey until the late middle ages 54 although the eastern regions remained in firm sasanian hands up to the first half of the 7th century ad the frequent byzantine-sassanid wars as part of the centuries long-lasting roman-persian wars fought between the neighboring rivaling byzantines and sasanians took place in various parts of present-day turkey and decided much of the latters history from the 4th century ad up to the first half of the 7th century ad seljuks and the ottoman empire the house of seljuk was a branch of the kınık oğuz turks who resided on the periphery of the muslim world in the yabgu khaganate of the oğuz confederacy to the north of the caspian and aral seas in the 9th century 56 in the 10th century the seljuks started migrating from their ancestral homeland into persia which became the administrative core of the great seljuk empire 57 in the latter half of the 11th century the seljuk turks began penetrating into medieval armenia and the eastern regions of anatolia in 1071 the seljuks defeated the byzantines at the battle of manzikert starting the turkification process in the area the turkish language and islam were introduced to armenia and anatolia gradually spreading throughout the region the slow transition from a predominantly christian and greek-speaking anatolia to a predominantly muslim and turkish-speaking one was underway 58 alongside the turkification of the territory the culturally persianized seljuks set the basis for a turko-persian principal culture in anatolia 59 which their eventual successors the ottomans would take over 60 61 in 1243 the seljuk armies were defeated by the mongols causing the seljuk empires power to slowly disintegrate in its wake one of the turkish principalities governed by osman i would over the next 200 years evolve into the ottoman empire in 1453 the ottomans completed their conquest of the byzantine empire by capturing its capital constantinople 62 in 1514 sultan selim i  1512–1520 successfully expanded the empires southern and eastern borders by defeating shah ismail i of the safavid dynasty in the battle of chaldiran in 1517 selim i expanded ottoman rule into algeria and egypt and created a naval presence in the red sea subsequently a competition started between the ottoman and portuguese empires to become the dominant sea power in the indian ocean with a number of naval battles in the red sea the arabian sea and the persian gulf the portuguese presence in the indian ocean was perceived as a threat for the ottoman monopoly over the ancient trade routes between east asia and western europe despite the increasingly prominent european presence the ottoman empires trade with the east continued to flourish until the second half of the 18th century 65 the ottoman empires power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries particularly during the reign of suleiman the magnificent who personally instituted major legislative changes relating to society education taxation and criminal law the empire was often at odds with the holy roman empire in its steady advance towards central europe through the balkans and the southern part of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth 66 at sea the ottoman navy contended with several holy leagues such as those in 1538 1571 1684 and 1717 composed primarily of habsburg spain the republic of genoa the republic of venice the knights of st john the papal states the grand duchy of tuscany and the duchy of savoy for the control of the mediterranean sea in the east the ottomans were often at war with safavid persia over conflicts stemming from territorial disputes or religious differences between the 16th and 18th centuries 67 the ottoman wars with persia continued as the zand afsharid and qajar dynasties succeeded the safavids in iran until the first half of the 19th century from the 16th to the early 20th centuries the ottoman empire also fought many wars with the russian tsardom and empire these were initially about the ottoman territorial expansion and consolidation in southeastern and eastern europe but starting from the latter half of the 18th century they became more about the survival of the ottoman state which began to lose its strategic territories on the northern black sea coast to the advancing russians between the 18th and the early 20th centuries the ottoman persian and russian empires were neighbouring rivals of each other from the second half of the 18th century onwards the ottoman empire began to decline the tanzimat reforms of the 19th century aimed to modernize the ottoman state in line with the progress that was made in the west but these efforts proved to be inadequate in most fields and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire 19 as it gradually shrank in size military power and wealth especially after the ottoman economic crisis and default in 1875 68 which led to uprisings in the balkan provinces that culminated into the russo-turkish war of 1877–78 many balkan muslims migrated to the empires heartland in anatolia 69 70 along with the circassians fleeing the russian conquest of the caucasus the decline of the ottoman empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among the various subject peoples leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence such as the hamidian massacres of armenians 71 the young turk revolution in 1908 restored the ottoman constitution and parliament 30 years after their suspension by sultan abdülhamid ii in 1878 but the 1913 ottoman coup détat effectively put the country under the control of the three pashas this made sultans mehmed v and mehmed vi largely symbolic figureheads with no real political power the ottoman empire entered world war i on the side of the central powers and was ultimately defeated during the war the empires armenians were deported to syria as part of the armenian genocide as a result an estimated 800,000 to 1,500,000 armenians were killed 72 73 74 75 the turkish government has refused to acknowledge the events as genocide and claims that armenians were only relocated from the eastern war zone 76 large-scale massacres were also committed against the empires other minority groups such as the assyrians and greeks 77 78 79 following the armistice of mudros on 30 october 1918 the victorious allied powers sought to partition the ottoman state through the 1920 treaty of sèvres 62 republic of turkey the occupation of istanbul and izmir by the allies in the aftermath of world war i prompted the establishment of the turkish national movement 80 under the leadership of mustafa kemal pasha a military commander who had distinguished himself during the battle of gallipoli the turkish war of independence was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the treaty of sèvres 81 by 18 september 1922 the occupying armies were expelled 82 and the ankara-based turkish regime which had declared itself the legitimate government of the country on 23 april 1920 started to formalize the legal transition from the old ottoman into the new republican political system on 1 november 1922 the turkish parliament in ankara formally abolished the sultanate thus ending 623 years of monarchical ottoman rule the treaty of lausanne of 24 july 1923 led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the newly formed republic of turkey as the successor state of the ottoman empire and the republic was officially proclaimed on 29 october 1923 in ankara the countrys new capital 83 the lausanne treaty stipulated a population exchange between greece and turkey whereby 1.1 million greeks left turkey for greece in exchange for 380,000 muslims transferred from greece to turkey 84 mustafa kemal became the republics first president and subsequently introduced many radical reforms with the aim of transforming the old religion-based and multi-communal ottoman state system constitutional monarchy into an essentially turkish nation state parliamentary republic with a secular constitution 85 with the surname law of 1934 the turkish parliament bestowed upon mustafa kemal the honorific surname atatürk father of the turks 81 turkey remained neutral during most of world war ii but entered the closing stages of the war on the side of the allies on 23 february 1945 on 26 june 1945 turkey became a charter member of the united nations 86 difficulties faced by greece after the war in quelling a communist rebellion along with demands by the soviet union for military bases in the turkish straits prompted the united states to declare the truman doctrine in 1947 the doctrine enunciated american intentions to guarantee the security of turkey and greece and resulted in large-scale us military and economic support both countries were included in the marshall plan and oeec for rebuilding european economies in 1948 87 and subsequently became founding members of the oecd in 1961 88 after participating with the united nations forces in the korean war turkey joined nato in 1952 becoming a bulwark against soviet expansion into the mediterranean following a decade of cypriot intercommunal violence and the coup in cyprus on 15 july 1974 staged by the eoka b paramilitary organization which overthrew president makarios and installed the pro-enosis union with greece nikos sampson as dictator turkey invaded cyprus on 20 july 1974 89 nine years later the turkish republic of northern cyprus which is recognized only by turkey was established 90 the single-party period ended in 1945 it was followed by a tumultuous transition to multiparty democracy over the next few decades which was interrupted by military coups détat in 1960 1971 and 1980 as well as a military memorandum in 1997 91 92 in 1984 the pkk a kurdish separatist group began an insurgency campaign against the turkish government the kurdish-turkish conflict to date has claimed over 40,000 lives 93 over 3,000 kurdish villages were burned by turkish security forces and hundreds of thousands of kurds displaced 94 and kurdish political parties were banned 95 peace talks were launched in 2012 96 97 but hostilities restarted in 2015 following the suruc bombing 98 since the liberalization of the turkish economy during the 1980s the country has enjoyed stronger economic growth and greater political stability 99 in 2013 widespread protests erupted in many turkish provinces sparked by a plan to demolish gezi park but growing into general anti-government dissent 100 on 15–16 july 2016 an unsuccessful coup attempt tried to oust the government 101 administrative divisions turkey has a unitary structure in terms of administration and this aspect is one of the most important factors shaping the turkish public administration when three powers executive legislative and judiciary are taken into account as the main functions of the state local administrations have little power turkey is a unitary not a federal system and the provinces are subordinated to the centre local administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is represented by the governors and city governors besides the governors and the city governors other senior public officials are also appointed by the central government rather than appointed by mayors or elected by constituents 102 turkey is subdivided into 81 provinces for administrative purposes each province is divided into districts for a total of 923 districts 103 turkey is also subdivided into 7 regions and 21 subregions for geographic demographic and economic purposes this does not refer to an administrative division 104 politics turkey is a parliamentary representative democracy since its foundation as a republic in 1923 turkey has developed a strong tradition of secularism 105 turkeys constitution governs the legal framework of the country it sets out the main principles of government and establishes turkey as a unitary centralized state the president of the republic is the head of state and has a largely ceremonial role the president is elected for a five-year term by direct elections and tayyip erdoğan is the first president elected by direct voting executive power is exercised by the prime minister and the council of ministers which make up the government while the legislative power is vested in the unicameral parliament the grand national assembly of turkey the judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature and the constitutional court is charged with ruling on the conformity of laws and decrees with the constitution the council of state is the tribunal of last resort for administrative cases and the high court of appeals for all others 106 the prime minister is elected by the parliament through a vote of confidence in the government and is most often the head of the party having the most seats in parliament the prime minister is binali yıldırım who replaced ahmet davutoğlu on 24 may 2016 universal suffrage for both sexes has been applied throughout turkey since 1933 and every turkish citizen who has turned 18 years of age has the right to vote there are 550 members of parliament who are elected for a four-year term by a party-list proportional representation system from 85 electoral districts the constitutional court can strip the public financing of political parties that it deems anti-secular or separatist or ban their existence altogether 107 108 the electoral threshold is 10 percent of the votes 109 supporters of atatürks reforms are called kemalists as distinguished from islamists representing two extremes on a continuum of beliefs about the proper role of religion in public life 110 the kemalist position generally combines a kind of democracy with a laicist constitution and westernised secular lifestyle while supporting state intervention in the economy education and other public services 110 since the 1980s a rise in income inequality and class distinction has given rise to islamic populism a movement that in theory supports obligation to authority communal solidarity and social justice though what that entails in practice is often contested 110 human rights human rights in turkey have been the subject of some controversy and international condemnation between 1998 and 2008 the european court of human rights made more than 1,600 judgements against turkey for human rights violations particularly regarding the right to life and freedom from torture other issues such as kurdish rights womens rights lgbt rights and press freedom have also attracted controversy turkeys human rights record continues to be a significant obstacle to future membership of the eu 111 according to the committee to protect journalists the akp government has waged one of the worlds biggest crackdowns on press freedoms 112 a large number of journalists have been arrested using charges of terrorism and anti-state activities such as the ergenekon and balyoz cases while thousands have been investigated on charges such as denigrating turkishness or insulting islam in an effort to sow self-censorship 112 in 2012 the cpj identified 76 jailed journalists in turkey including 61 directly held for their published work ranking 1st in the world more than in iran eritrea or china 112 while freemuse identified 9 musicians imprisoned for their work ranking 3rd after russia and china 113 a former us state department spokesman philip j crowley said that the united states had broad concerns about trends involving intimidation of journalists in turkey 114 turkey has a not free rating by freedom house 115 in its resolution the functioning of democratic institutions in turkey on 22 june 2016 the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe warned that recent developments in turkey pertaining to freedom of the media and of expression erosion of the rule of law and the human rights violations in relation to anti-terrorism security operations in south-east turkey have  raised serious questions about the functioning of its democratic institutions 116 law turkey has a legal system which has been wholly integrated with the system of continental europe for instance the turkish civil law has been modified by incorporating elements mainly of the swiss civil code the code of obligations and the german commercial code the administrative law bears similarities with its french counterpart and the penal code with its italian counterpart 117 turkey has adopted the principle of the separation of powers in line with this principle judicial power is exercised by independent courts on behalf of the turkish nation the independence and organization of the courts the security of the tenure of judges and public prosecutors the profession of judges and prosecutors the supervision of judges and public prosecutors the military courts and their organization and the powers and duties of the high courts are regulated by the turkish constitution 118 according to article 142 of the turkish constitution the organization duties and jurisdiction of the courts their functions and the trial procedures are regulated by law in line with the aforementioned article of the turkish constitution and related laws the court system in turkey can be classified under three main categories which are the judicial courts administrative courts and military courts each category includes first instance courts and high courts in addition the court of jurisdictional disputes rules on cases that cannot be classified readily as falling within the purview of one court system 118 law enforcement in turkey is carried out by several departments such as the general directorate of security and gendarmerie general command and agencies all acting under the command of the prime minister of turkey or mostly the minister of internal affairs according to figures released by the justice ministry there are 100,000 people in turkish prisons as of november 2008 a doubling since 2000 119 in the years of government by the akp and tayyip erdoğan particularly since 2013 the independence and integrity of the turkish judiciary has increasingly been considered in doubt by institutions parliamentarians and journalists both within and outside of turkey due to political interference in the promotion of judges and prosecutors and in their pursuit of public duty 120 121 122 123 the turkey 2015 report of the european commission stated that the independence of the judiciary and respect of the principle of separation of powers have been undermined and judges and prosecutors have been under strong political pressure 120 foreign relations turkey is a founding member of the united nations  1945 124 the oecd  1961 125 the oic  1969 126 the osce  1973 127 the eco  1985 128 the bsec  1992 129 the d-8  1997 130 and the g-20  1999 131 turkey was a member of the united nations security council in 1951–1952 1954–1955 1961 and 2009–2010 132 in september 2013 turkey became a member of the asia cooperation dialogue acd in line with its traditional western orientation relations with europe have always been a central part of turkish foreign policy turkey became one of the first members of the council of europe in 1949

of the eec in 1987 became an associate member of the western european union in 1992 joined the eu customs union in 1995 and has been in formal accession negotiations with the eu since 2005 25 today eu membership is considered as a state policy and a strategic target by turkey 133 turkeys support for northern cyprus in the cyprus dispute complicates turkeys relations with the eu and remains a major stumbling block to the countrys eu accession bid 134 the other defining aspect of turkeys foreign policy was the countrys long-standing strategic alliance with the united states 135 136 the common threat posed by the soviet union during the cold war led to turkeys membership of nato in 1952 ensuring close bilateral relations with washington subsequently turkey benefited from the united states political economic and diplomatic support including in key issues such as the countrys bid to join the european union 137 in the postcold war environment turkeys geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the middle east the caucasus and the balkans 138 the independence of the turkic states of the soviet union in 1991 with which turkey shares a common cultural and linguistic heritage allowed turkey to extend its economic and political relations deep into central asia 139 thus enabling the completion of a multi-billion-dollar oil and natural gas pipeline from baku in azerbaijan to the port of ceyhan in turkey the bakutbilisiceyhan pipeline forms part of turkeys foreign policy strategy to become an energy conduit to the west however turkeys border with armenia a state in the caucasus was closed by turkey in support of azerbaijan during the nagorno-karabakh war and remains closed 140 under the akp government turkeys influence has grown in the formerly ottoman territories of the middle east and the balkans based on the strategic depth doctrine a terminology that was coined by ahmet davutoğlu for defining turkeys increased engagement in regional foreign policy issues also called neo-ottomanism 141 142 following the arab spring in december 2010 the choices made by the akp government for supporting certain political opposition groups in the affected countries have led to tensions with some arab states such as turkeys neighbour syria since the start of the syrian civil war and egypt after the ousting of president mohamed morsi 143 144 as of 2016update turkey doesnt have an ambassador in syria and egypt 145 146 diplomatic relations with israel were also severed after the gaza flotilla raid in 2010 but were normalized following a deal in june 2016 147 these political rifts have left turkey with few allies in the east mediterranean where rich natural gas fields have recently been discovered 148 149 in sharp contrast with the original goals that were set by the former foreign minister later prime minister ahmet davutoğlu in his zero problems with neighbours 150 151 foreign policy doctrine 152 in 2015 turkey saudi arabia and qatar formed a strategic alliance against syrian president bashar al-assad 153 154 turkey has maintained forces in international missions under the united nations and nato since 1950 including peacekeeping missions in somalia and former yugoslavia and support to coalition forces in the first gulf war turkey maintains 36,000 troops in northern cyprus though their presence is controversial 155 and assists iraqi kurdistan with security 156 turkey has had troops deployed in afghanistan as part of the united states stabilization force and the un-authorized nato-commanded international security assistance

progresses eastward 170 turkeys varied landscapes are the product of complex earth movements that have shaped the region over thousands of years and still manifest themselves in fairly frequent earthquakes and occasional volcanic eruptions the bosphorus and the dardanelles owe their existence to the fault lines running through turkey that led to the creation of the black sea the north anatolian fault line runs across the north of the country from west to east along which major earthquakes took place in history the latest of those big earthquakes was the 1999 i̇zmit earthquake

government such as türkiye i̇ş bankası  1924 sanayi ve maadin bankası  1925 emlak ve eytam bankası  1926 central bank of turkey  1930 sümerbank  1933 i̇ller bankası  1933 etibank  1935 denizbank  1937 halk bankası  1938 etc had to subsidize most of the industrial projects due to the lack of a strong private sector however in the period between the 1920s and 1950s a new generation of turkish entrepreneurs such as nuri demirağ vehbi koç hacı ömer sabancı and nejat eczacıbaşı began to establish privately owned factories some of which evolved into the largest industrial conglomerates that dominate the turkish economy today such as koç holding sabancı holding and eczacıbaşı holding during the first six decades of the republic between 1923 and 1983 turkey generally adhered to a quasi-statist approach with strict government planning of the budget and government-imposed limitations over foreign trade flow of foreign currency foreign direct investment and private sector participation in certain fields such as broadcasting telecommunications energy mining etc however in 1983 prime minister turgut özal initiated a series of reforms designed to shift the economy from a statist insulated system to a more private-sector market-based model 99 the reforms combined with unprecedented amounts of funding from foreign loans spurred rapid economic growth but this growth was punctuated by sharp recessions and financial crises in 1994 1999 following the earthquake of that year 205 and 2001 206 resulting in an average of 4 percent gdp growth per annum between 1981 and 2003 207 lack of additional fiscal reforms combined with large and growing public sector deficits and widespread corruption resulted in high inflation a weak banking sector and increased macroeconomic volatility 208 since the economic crisis of 2001 and the reforms initiated by the finance minister of the time kemal derviş inflation has dropped to single-digit figures for the first time in decades  8 in 2005 investor confidence and foreign investment have soared and unemployment has fallen  10 in 2005 209 turkey has gradually opened up its markets through economic reforms by reducing government

percent annually 212 which made turkey one of the fastest growing economies in the world during that period however growth slowed to 1 percent in 2008 and in 2009 the turkish economy was affected by the global financial crisis with a recession of 5 percent the economy was estimated to have returned to 8 percent growth in 2010 7 according to eurostat data turkish gdp per capita adjusted by purchasing power standard stood at 52 percent of the eu average in 2011 213 in the early years of the 21st century the chronically high inflation was brought under control this led to the launch of a new currency the turkish new lira yeni türk lirası in 2005 to cement the acquisition of the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy 214 in 2009 after only four years in circulation the turkish new lira was renamed back to the turkish lira with the introduction of new banknotes and coins and the withdrawal of the turkish new lira banknotes and coins that were introduced in 2005 but the iso 4217 code of the turkish new lira try remains in use for the current turkish lira in the foreign exchange market tourism tourism in turkey has experienced rapid growth

in turkey fell from 19 percent in 1914 to 2.5 percent in 1927 294 due to events which had a significant impact on the countrys demographic structure such as the armenian genocide the population exchange between greece and turkey 295 and the emigration of non-muslims such as levantines greeks armenians jews etc to foreign countries mostly in europe and the americas that actually began in the

ottoman empire and still continues today this mix originally began as a result of the encounter of turks and their culture with those of the peoples who were in their path during their migration from central asia to the west 325 326 turkish culture is a product of efforts to be a modern western state while maintaining traditional religious and historical values 325 arts turkish painting in the western sense developed actively starting from the mid 19th century the very first painting lessons were scheduled at what is now the istanbul technical university then the imperial military engineering school in 1793 mostly for technical purposes 327 in the late 19th century human figure in the western sense was being established in turkish painting especially with osman hamdi bey impressionism among the contemporary trends appeared later on with halil paşa the young turkish artists sent to europe in 1926 came back inspired by contemporary trends such as fauvism cubism and even expressionism still very influential in europe the later group d of artists led by abidin dino cemal tollu fikret mualla fahrünnisa zeid bedri rahmi eyüboğlu adnan çoker and burhan doğançay introduced some trends that had lasted in the west for more than three decades other important movements in turkish painting were the yeniler grubu the newcomers group of the late 1930s the onlar grubu group of ten of the 1940s the yeni dal grubu new branch group of the 1950s and the siyah kalem grubu black pen group of the 1960s 328 turkish music and literature are examples of a mix of cultural influences interaction between the ottoman empire and the islamic world along with europe contributed to a blend of turkic islamic and european traditions in modern-day turkish music and literary arts 330 turkish literature was heavily influenced by persian and arabic literature during most of the ottoman era the tanzimat reforms introduced previously unknown western genres primarily the novel and the short story many of the writers in the tanzimat period wrote in several genres simultaneously for instance the poet nâmık kemal also wrote the important 1876 novel i̇ntibâh awakening while the journalist şinasi is noted for writing in 1860 the first modern turkish play the one-act comedy şair evlenmesi the poets marriage most of the roots of modern turkish literature were formed between the years 1896 and 1923 broadly there were three primary literary movements during this period the edebiyyât-ı cedîde new literature movement the fecr-i âtî dawn of the future movement and the millî edebiyyât national literature movement the first radical step of innovation in 20th century turkish poetry was taken by nâzım hikmet who introduced the free verse style another revolution in turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the garip movement the mix of cultural influences in turkey is dramatized for example in the form of the new symbols of the clash and interlacing of cultures enacted in the novels of orhan pamuk recipient of the 2006 nobel prize in literature 331 turkey has a diverse folkloric dance culture hora is performed in east thrace zeybek in the aegean region southern marmara

architecture he was the chief architect of at least 374 buildings which were constructed in various provinces of the ottoman empire in the 16th century 334 since the 18th century turkish architecture has been increasingly influenced by european styles and this can be particularly seen in the tanzimat era buildings of istanbul like the dolmabahçe çırağan feriye beylerbeyi küçüksu ihlamur and yıldız palaces which were all designed by members of the balyan family of ottoman court architects 335 the ottoman era waterfront houses yalı on the bosphorus also reflect the fusion between classical
