proto-elamite and elamite kingdoms in 3200–2800 bc the area was first unified by the iranian medes in 625bc who became the dominant cultural and political power in the region 4 iran reached its greatest geographic extent during the achaemenid empire founded by cyrus the great in 550bc which at one time stretched from parts of eastern europe in the west to the indus valley in the east making it the largest empire the world had yet seen 20 the empire collapsed in 330 bc following the conquests of alexander the great but reemerged shortly after as the parthian empire under the sassanid dynasty iran again became one of the leading powers in the world for the next four centuries 21 22 beginning in 633 ad rashidun arabs conquered iran and largely displaced the indigenous faiths of manichaeism and zoroastrianism by sunni islam iran became a major contributor to the islamic golden age that followed producing many influential scientists scholars artists and thinkers the rise of the safavid dynasty in 1501 led to the establishment of twelver shia islam as the official religion of iran marking one of the most important turning points in iranian and muslim history 6 23 during the 18th century iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the sassanid empire and under nader shah briefly possessed what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time 24 through the late 18th and 19th centuries a series of conflicts with russia led to significant territorial losses and the erosion of sovereignty 25 26 popular unrest culminated in the persian constitutional revolution of 1906 which established a constitutional monarchy and the countrys first legislative body the majles following a coup détat instigated by the uk and the us in 1953 iran gradually became closely aligned with the west but grew increasingly autocratic 27 growing dissent against foreign influence and political repression led to the 1979 revolution and the establishment of an islamic republic 16 iran is a major regional and middle power 28 29 and its large reserves of fossil fuels  which include the largest natural gas supply in the world and the fourth-largest proven oil reserves

aryān in reference to iranians 34 the middle iranian ērān and aryān are oblique plural forms of gentilic ēr- middle persian and ary- parthian both deriving from proto-iranian arya- meaning aryan ie of the iranians 34 35 argued to descend from proto-indo-european ar-yo- meaning skillful assembler 36 in the iranian languages the gentilic is attested as a self-identifier included in ancient inscriptions and the literature of avesta 37a and remains also in other iranian ethnic names such as alans ossetic ир  ir and iron ossetic ирон  iron 35 historically iran has been referred to as persia by the west due mainly to the writings of greek historians who called iran persis greek περσίς 38 meaning land of the persians as the most extensive interactions the ancient greeks had with any outsider was with the persians the term persisted even long after the persian rule in greece however persis old persian pārśa modern persian pārse was originally referred to a region settled by persians in the west shore of lake urmia in the 9th century bc the settlement was then shifted to the southern end of the zagros mountains and is today defined as fars province in 1935 reza shah requested the international community to refer to the country by its native name iran as the new york times explained at the time at the suggestion of the persian legation in berlin the tehran government on the persian new year nowruz march 21 1935 substituted iran for persia as the official name of the country opposition to the name change led to the reversal of the decision and professor ehsan yarshater editor of encyclopædia iranica propagated a move to use persia and iran interchangeably 39 today both persia and iran are used in cultural contexts although iran is the name used officially in political contexts 40 historical and cultural usage of the word iran is not restricted to the modern state proper 41 42 43 greater iran irānzamīn or irān e bozorg 44 correspond to territories of the iranian cultural and linguistic zones in addition to modern iran it includes portions of the caucasus mesopotamia anatolia and central asia 45 history prehistory the earliest archaeological artifacts in iran like those excavated at the kashafrud and ganj par sites attest to a human presence in iran since the lower paleolithic era c 800,000–200,000 bc 46 irans neanderthal artifacts from the middle paleolithic period c 200,000–40,000 bc have been found mainly in the zagros region at sites such as warwasi and yafteh cave 47 48pageneeded around 10th to 8th millennium bc early agricultural communities such as chogha golan and chogha bonut began to flourish in iran 49 50 51 52 as well as susa and chogha mish developing in and around the zagros region 53pageneeded 54 55 the emergence of susa as a city as determined by radiocarbon dating dates back to early 4,395bc 56 there are dozens of prehistoric sites across the iranian plateau pointing to the existence of ancient cultures and urban settlements in the 4th millennium bc 55 57 58 during the bronze age iran was home to several civilizations including elam jiroft and zayande river elam the most prominent of these civilizations developed in the southwest of iran alongside those in mesopotamia the emergence of writing in elam was paralleled to sumer and the elamite cuneiform was developed since the 3rd millennium bc 59 the elamite kingdom continued its existence until the emergence of the median and achaemenid empires between 3400 bc until about 2000 bc northwestern iran was part of the kura-araxes culture that stretched into the neighbouring regions of the caucasus and anatolia since the earliest 2nd millennium bc assyrians settled in swaths of western iran and incorporated the region into their territoriescitation needed classical antiquity during the 2nd millennium bc proto-iranian tribes arrived in iran from the eurasian steppes 60 rivaling the native settlers of the country 61 62 as these tribes dispersed into the wider area of greater iran and beyond the boundaries of modern iran were dominated by the persian median and parthian tribes from the late 10th to late 7th centuries bc the iranian peoples together with the pre-iranian kingdoms fell under the domination of the assyrian empire based in northern mesopotamia 63 under king cyaxares the medes and persians entered into an alliance with nabopolassar of babylon as well as the scythians and the cimmerians and together they attacked the assyrian empire the civil war ravaged the assyrian empire between 616bc and 605bc thus freeing their respective peoples from three centuries of assyrian rule 63 the unification of the median tribes under a single ruler in 728bc led to the foundation of the median empire which by 612bc controlled the whole iran and the eastern anatolia 64 this marked the end of the kingdom of urartu as well which was subsequently conquered and dissolved 65 66 in 550bc cyrus the great son of mandane and cambyses i took over the median empire and founded the achaemenid empire by unifying other city states the conquest of media was a result of what is called the persian revolt the brouhaha was initially triggered by the actions of the median ruler astyages and was quickly spread to other provinces as they allied with the persians later conquests under cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include lydia babylon egypt parts of the balkans and eastern europe proper as well as the lands to the west of the indus and oxus rivers 539 bc was the year in which persian forces defeated the babylonian army at opis and marked the end of around four centuries of mesopotamian domination of the region with the transition from the neo-babylonian period to the achaemenid period cyrus entered babylon and presented himself as a traditional mesopotamian monarch subsequent achaemenid art and iconography reflect the influence of the new political reality in mesopotamia at its greatest extent the achaemenid empire included the modern territories of iran azerbaijan armenia georgia turkey much of the black sea coastal regions northeastern greece and southern bulgaria thrace northern greece and macedonia paeonia and ancient macedon iraq syria lebanon jordan israel palestine all significant ancient population centers of ancient egypt as far west as libya kuwait northern saudi arabia parts of the uae and oman pakistan afghanistan and much of central asia making it the first world government and the largest empire the world had yet seen 20 it is estimated that in 480 bc 50 million people lived in the achaemenid empire 67 68 the empire at its peak ruled over 44 of the worlds population the highest such figure for any empire in history 69 in greek history the achaemenid empire is considered as the antagonist of the greek city states for the emancipation of slaves including the jewish exiles in babylon building infrastructures such as road and postal systems and the use of an official language the imperial aramaic throughout its territories 20 the empire had a centralized bureaucratic administration under the emperor a large professional army and civil services inspiring similar developments in later empires 70 71 furthermore one of the seven wonders of the ancient world the mausoleum at halicarnassus was built in the empire between 353 and 350 bc eventual conflict on the western borders began with the ionian revolt which erupted into the greco-persian wars and continued through the first half of the 5th century bc and ended with the persian withdrawal from all of their european territories in the balkans and eastern europe proper 72 in 334bc alexander the great invaded the achaemenid empire defeating the last achaemenid emperor darius iii at the battle of issus following the premature death of alexander iran came under the control of the hellenistic seleucid empire in the middle of the 2nd century bc the parthian empire rose to become the main power in iran and the century-long geopolitical arch-rivalry between romans and parthians began culminating in the romanparthian wars the parthian empire continued as a feudal monarchy for nearly five centuries until 224ce when it was succeeded by the sassanid empire 73 together with their neighboring arch-rival the roman-byzantines they made up the worlds two most dominant powers at the time for over four centuries 21 22 the sassanids established an empire within the frontiers achieved by the achaemenids with their capital at ctesiphon the sassanid empire of the late antiquity is considered as one of the most influential periods of iran as iran influenced the culture of ancient rome and through that as far as western europe 74 75 africa 76 china and india 77 and played a prominent role in the formation of both european and asian medieval art 78 most of the era of both parthian and sassanid empires were overshadowed by the roman-persian wars which raged on their western borders at the anatolia the western caucasus mesopotamia and the levant for over 700 years these wars exhausted both romans and sassanids and led to the defeat of both at the hands of the invading muslim arabs several offshoots of the achaemenids parthians and sassanids established eponymous dynasties and branches in anatolia and the caucasus including the kingdom of pontus the mihranids and the arsacid dynasties of armenia iberia georgia and caucasian albania present-day azerbaijan and southern dagestan medieval period the prolonged byzantine-sassanid wars most importantly the climactic byzantine-sassanid war of 602-628 as well as the social conflict within the sassanid empire opened the way for an arab invasion to iran in the 7th century 79 80 initially defeated by the arab rashidun caliphate iran came under the rule of the arab caliphates of umayyad and abbasid the prolonged and gradual process of the islamization of iran began following the conquest under the new arab elite of the rashidun and later the umayyad caliphates both converted mawali and non-converted dhimmi iranians were discriminated against being excluded from the government and military and having to pay a special tax called jizya 81 82 gunde shapur home of the academy of gunde shapur which was the most important medical center of the world at the time survived after the invasion but became known as an islamic institute thereafter 83 in 750 the abbasids overthrew the umayyads due mainly to the support from the mawali iranians 87 the mawali formed the majority of the rebel army which was led by the iranian general abu muslim 88 89 90 the arrival of the abbasid caliphs saw a revival of iranian culture and influence and a move away from the imposed arabic customs the role of the old arab aristocracy was gradually replaced by an iranian bureaucracy 91 after two centuries of the arab rule semi-independent and independent iranian kingdoms such as the tahirids saffarids samanids and buyids began to appear on the fringes of the declining abbasid caliphate by the samanid era in the 9th and 10th centuries the efforts of iranians to regain their independence had been well solidified 92 the blossoming literature philosophy medicine and art of iran became major elements in the formation of a new age for the iranian civilization during the period known as the islamic golden age 93 94 the islamic golden age reached its peak by the 10th and 11th centuries during which iran was the main theater of the scientific activities 83 after the 10th century the persian language alongside arabic was used for the scientific philosophical historical musical and medical works whereas the important iranian writers such as tusi avicenna qotb od din shirazi and biruni had major contributions in the scientific writing the cultural revival that began in the abbasid period led to a resurfacing of the iranian national identity and so earlier attempts of arabization never succeeded in iran the iranian shuubiyah movement became a catalyst for iranians to regain independence in their relations with the arab invaders 95 the most notable effect of this movement was the continuation of the persian language attested to the epic poet ferdowsi now regarded as the most important figure in iranian literature the 10th century saw a mass migration of turkic tribes from central asia into the iranian plateau 96 turkic tribesmen were first used in the abbasid army as mamluks slave-warriors replacing iranian and arab elements within the army 88 as a result the mamluks gained a significant political power in 999 large portions of iran came briefly under the rule of the ghaznavids whose rulers were of mamluk turk origin and longer subsequently under the turkish seljuk and khwarezmian empires these turks had been persianized and had adopted persian models of administration and rulership 96 the seljuks subsequently gave rise to the sultanate of rum in anatolia while taking their thoroughly persianized identity with them 97 98 the result of the adoption and patronage of persian culture by turkish rulers was the development of a distinct turko-persian tradition in 1219–21 the khwarezmian empire suffered a devastating invasion by the mongol army of genghis khan according to steven r ward mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-fourths of the population of the iranian plateau possibly 10 to 15 million people some historians have estimated that irans population did not again reach its pre-mongol levels until the mid-20th century 99 following the fracture of the mongol empire in 1256 hulagu khan grandson of genghis khan established the ilkhanate in iran in 1370 yet another conqueror timur followed the example of hulagu establishing the timurid empire which lasted for another 156 years in 1387 timur ordered the complete massacre of isfahan reportedly killing 70,000 citizens 100 the ilkhans and the timurids soon came to adopt the ways and customs of the iranians choosing to surround themselves with a culture that was distinctively iranian 101 early modern period by the 1500s ismail i from ardabil established the safavid dynasty with tabriz as the capital 96 beginning with azerbaijan he subsequently extended his authority over all of the iranian territories and established an intermittent iranian hegemony over the vast relative regions reasserting the iranian identity within large parts of the greater iran 102 iran was predominantly sunni 103 but ismail instigated a forced conversion to the shia branch of islam 104 by which the shia islam spread throughout the safavid territories in the caucasus iran anatolia and mesopotamia as a result thereof the modern-day iran is the only official shia nation of the world with it holding an absolute majority in iran and the republic of azerbaijan having there the 1st and 2nd highest number of shia inhabitants by population percentage in the world 105 106 the centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between safavid iran and the neighboring ottoman empire led to numerous ottomanpersian wars 99 the safavid era peaked in the reign of abbas the great 1587–1629 99 107 surpassing their ottoman archrivals in strength and making the empire a leading hub in western eurasia for the sciences and arts the safavid era saw the start of mass integration from caucasian populations into new layers of the society of iran as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of iran playing a pivotal role in the history of iran for centuries onwards following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and early 1700s which was caused by the internal conflicts the continuous wars with the ottomans and the foreign interference most notably the russian interference the safavid rule was ended by the pashtun rebels who besieged isfahan and defeated soltan hosein in 1722 in 1729 nader shah a chieftain and military genius from khorasan successfully drove out and conquered the pashtun invaders he subsequently took back the annexed caucasian territories which were divided among the ottoman and russian authorities by the ongoing chaos in iran during the reign of nader shah iran reached its greatest extent since the sassanid empire reestablishing the iranian hegemony all over the caucasus as well as other major parts of the west and central asia and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time 24 nader shah invaded india and sacked far off delhi by the late 1730s his territorial expansion as well as his military successes went into a decline following the final campaigns in the northern caucasus the assassination of nader shah sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil after which karim khan of the zand dynasty came to power in 1750 bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity 99 the geopolitical reach of the zand dynasty was limited compared to its preceding dynasties many of the iranian territories in the caucasus gained de facto independence and were locally ruled through various caucasian khanates however despite the self-ruling they all remained subjects and vassals to the zand king 108 the khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between central asia and the west 109 another civil war ensued after the death of karim khan in 1779 out of which aqa mohammad khan emerged founding the qajar dynasty in 1794 in 1795 following the disobedience of the georgian subjects and their alliance with the russians the qajars captured tblisi by the battle of krtsanisi and drove the russians out of the entire caucasus reestablishing a short-lived iranian suzerainty over the region the russo-persian wars of 1804–1813 and 1826–1828 resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for iran in the caucasus comprising all of transcaucasia and dagestan which made part of the very concept of iran for centuries 25 and thus substantial gains for the neighboring russian empire as a result of the 19th century russo-persian wars the russians took over the caucasus and iran irrevocably lost control over its integral territories in the region comprising modern-day dagestan georgia armenia and azerbaijan which got confirmed per the treaties of gulistan and turkmenchay 26 110 the area to the north of the river aras among which the contemporary republic of azerbaijan eastern georgia dagestan and armenia were iranian territory until they were occupied by russia in the course of the 19th century 26 111 112 113 114 115 116 as iran shrank many transcaucasian and north caucasian muslims moved towards iran 117 118 especially until the aftermath result of the caucasian war 118 and the decades afterwards while irans armenians were encouraged to settle in the newly incorporated russian territories 119 120 121 causing significant demographic shifts late modern period around 1.5 million people—20 to 25 of the population of irandied as a result of the great famine of 1870–1871 122 between 1872 and 1905 a series of protests took place in response to the sale of concessions to foreigners by nasser od din and mozaffar od din shahs of qajar and led to the iranian constitutional revolution the first iranian constitution and the first national parliament of iran were founded in 1906 through the ongoing revolution the constitution included the official recognition of irans three religious minorities namely christians zoroastrians and jews 123 which has remained a basis in the legislation of iran since then the struggle related to the constitutional movement continued until 1911 when mohammad ali shah was defeated and forced to abdicate on the pretext of restoring order the russians occupied northern iran in 1911 and maintained a military presence in the region for years to come during world war i the british occupied much of western iran and fully withdrew in 1921 the persian campaign commenced furthermore during world war i in northwestern iran after an ottoman invasion as part of the middle eastern theatre of world war i as a result of ottoman hostilities across the border a large amount of the assyrians of iran were massacred by the ottoman armies notably in and around urmia 124 125 apart from the rule of aqa mohammad khan the qajar rule is characterized as a century of misrule 96 in 1921 the qajar dynasty was overthrown by reza khan of the pahlavi dynasty who was the prime minister of iran and the former general of the persian cossack brigade and he became the new shah in 1941 reza shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son mohammad reza pahlavi and established the persian corridor a massive supply route that would last until the end of the ongoing war the presence of so many foreign troops in the nation also culminated in the soviet-backed establishment of two puppet regimes in the nation the azerbaijan peoples government and the republic of mahabad as the soviet union refused to relinquish the occupied iranian territory the iran crisis of 1946 was followed which particularly resulted in the dissolution of both puppet states and the withdrawal of the soviets in 1951 mohammad mosaddegh was elected as the prime minister he became enormously popular in iran after he nationalized irans petroleum industry and oil reserves he was deposed in the 1953 iranian coup détat an anglo-american covert operation that marked the first time the us had overthrown a foreign government during the cold war 126 after the coup the shah became increasingly autocratic and sultanistic and iran entered a phase of decades long controversial close relations with the united states and some other foreign governments 127 while the shah increasingly modernized iran and claimed to retain it as a fully secular state 27 arbitrary arrests and torture by his secret police the savak were used to crush all forms of political opposition ayatollah ruhollah khomeini became an active critic of the shahs white revolution and publicly denounced the government khomeini was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months after his release in 1964 khomeini publicly criticized the united states government the shah sent him into exile he went first to turkey then to iraq and finally to france due to the 1973 spike in oil prices the economy of iran was flooded with foreign currency which caused inflation by 1974 the economy of iran was experiencing double digit inflation and despite many large projects to modernize the country corruption was rampant and caused large amounts of waste by 1975 and 1976 an economic recession led to increased unemployment especially among millions of youth who had migrated to the cities of iran looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s by the late 1970s many of these people opposed the shahs regime and began to organize and join the protests against it 128 after the 1979 revolution the 1979 revolution later known as the islamic revolution 129 130 131 began in january 1978 with the first major demonstrations against the shah 132 after a year of strikes and demonstrations paralyzing the country and its economy mohammad reza pahlavi fled the country and ruhollah khomeini returned from exile to tehran in february 1979 forming a new government 133 after holding a referendum in april 1979 iran officially became an islamic republic 134 a second referendum in december 1979 approved a theocratic constitution 135 the immediate nationwide uprisings against the new government began by the 1979 kurdish rebellion with the khuzestan uprisings along with the uprisings in sistan and baluchestan province and other areas over the next several years these uprisings were subdued in a violent manner by the new islamic government the new government went about purging itself of the non-islamist political opposition as well as of those islamists who were not considered radical enough although both nationalists and marxists had initially joined with islamists to overthrow the shah tens of thousands were executed by the islamic government afterward 136 on november 4 1979 a group of students seized the united states embassy and took the embassy with 52 personnel and citizens hostage 137 after the united states refused to return mohammad reza pahlavi to iran to face trial in the court of the new regime and all but certain execution attempts by the jimmy carter administration to negotiate for the release of the hostages and a failed rescue attempt helped force carter out of office and brought ronald reagan to power on jimmy carters final day in office the last hostages were finally set free as a result of the algiers accords the cultural revolution began in 1980 with an initial closure of universities for three years in order to perform an inspection and cleanup in the cultural policy of the education and training system 138 on september 22 1980 the iraqi army invaded the iranian khuzestan and the iraniraq war began although the forces of saddam hussein made several early advances by mid 1982 the iranian forces successfully managed to drive the iraqi army back into iraq in july 1982 with iraq thrown on the defensive iran took the decision to invade iraq and conducted countless offensives in a bid to conquer iraqi territory and capture cities such as basra the war continued until 1988 when the iraqi army defeated the iranian forces inside iraq and pushed the remaining iranian troops back across the border subsequently khomeini accepted a truce mediated by the un the total iranian casualties in the war were estimated to be 123,220–160,000 kia 60,711 mia and 11,000–16,000 civilians killed 139 140 following the iraniraq war in 1989 akbar hashemi rafsanjani and his administration concentrated on a pragmatic pro-business policy of rebuilding and strengthening the economy without making any dramatic break with the ideology of the revolution in 1997 rafsanjani was succeeded by the moderate reformist mohammad khatami whose government attempted unsuccessfully to make the country more free and democratic 141 the 2005 presidential election brought conservative populist candidate mahmoud ahmadinejad to power 142 during the 2009 iranian presidential election the interior ministry announced incumbent president ahmadinejad had won 62.63 of the vote while mir-hossein mousavi had come in second place with 33.75 143 144 allegations of large irregularities and fraud provoked the 2009 iranian presidential election protests both within iran and in major cites outside the country 145 hassan rouhani was elected as president of iran on june 15 2013 defeating mohammad bagher ghalibaf and four other candidates 146 147 the electoral victory of new iranian president hassan rouhani has improved the relations of iran with other countries 148 geography iran has an area of 1,648,195km2  636,372sqmi 31 iran lies between latitudes 24 and 40 n and longitudes 44 and 64 e its borders are with azerbaijan  611km or 380mi with azerbaijan-naxcivan exclave 179km or 111mi 149 and armenia  35km or 22mi to the north-west the caspian sea to the north turkmenistan  992km or 616mi to the north-east pakistan  909km or 565mi and afghanistan  936km or 582mi to the east turkey  499km or 310mi and iraq  1,458km or 906mi to the west and finally the waters of the persian gulf and the gulf of oman to the south iran consists of the iranian plateau with the exception of the coasts of the caspian sea and khuzestan province it is one of the worlds most mountainous countries its landscape dominated by rugged mountain ranges that separate various basins or plateaux from one another the populous western part is the most mountainous with ranges such as the caucasus zagros and alborz mountains the last contains irans highest point mount damavand at 5,610m  18,406ft which is also the highest mountain on the eurasian landmass west of the hindu kush 150 the northern part of iran is covered by dense rain forests called shomal or the jungles of irancitation needed the eastern part consists mostly of desert basins such as the dasht-e kavir irans largest desert in the north-central portion of the country and the dasht-e lut in the east as well as some salt lakes this is because the

neo-aramaic and circassian 31 ethnic groups as with the spoken languages the ethnic group composition also remains a point of debate mainly regarding the largest and second largest ethnic groups the

ethno-linguistic group that comprise the speakers of the iranian languages 288 with persians incl mazenderanis and gilaks constituting 61 of the population kurds 10 lurs 6 and balochs 2 peoples of the

them the number of ethnic azerbaijanis in iran comprises between 21.6–30 of the total population with the majority holding it on 25c 291d 292 293 294 295 296 in any case the largest population of
