power station a power station also referred to as a generating station power plant powerhouse or generating plant is an industrial facility for the generation of electric power most power stations contain one or more generators a rotating machine that converts mechanical power into electrical power the relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor creates an electrical current the energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely most power stations in the world burn fossil fuels such as coal oil and natural gas to generate electricity others use nuclear power but there is an increasing use of cleaner renewable sources such as solar wind wave and hydroelectric  contents 1 history 2 thermal power stations 2.1 classification 2.1.1 by heat source 2.1.2 by prime

 historyedit in 1868 a hydro electric power station was designed and built by lord armstrong at cragside england it used water from lakes on his estate to power siemens dynamos the electricity supplied power to lights heating produced hot water ran an elevator as well as labor-saving devices and farm buildings 1 in the early 1870s belgian inventor z√©nobe gramme invented a generator powerful enough to produce power on a commercial scale for industry 2 in the autumn of 1882 a central station providing public power was built in godalming england it was proposed after the town failed to reach an agreement on the rate charged by the gas company so the town council decided to use electricity it used hydroelectric power that was used to street and household lighting the system was not a commercial success and the town reverted to gas 3 in 1882 a public power station the edison electric light station was built in london was a project of thomas edison organized by edward johnson a babcock  wilcox boiler powered a 125-horsepower steam engine that drove a 27-ton generator this supplied electricity to premises in the area that could be reached through the culverts of the viaduct without digging up the road which was the monopoly of the gas companies the customers included the city temple and the old bailey another important customer was the telegraph office of the general post office but this could not be reached though the culverts johnson arranged for the supply cable to be run overhead via holborn tavern and newgate 4 in september 1882 in new york the pearl street station was established by edison to provide electric lighting in the lower manhattan island area the station ran until destroyed by fire in 1890 the station used reciprocating steam engines to turn direct-current generators because of the dc distribution the service area was small limited by voltage drop in the feeders the war of currents eventually resolved in favor of ac distribution and utilization although some dc systems persisted to the end of the 20th century dc systems with a service radius of a mile kilometer or so were necessarily smaller less efficient of fuel consumption and more labor-intensive to operate than much larger central ac generating stations ac systems used a wide range of frequencies depending on the type of load lighting load using higher frequencies and traction systems and heavy motor load systems preferring lower frequencies the economics of central station generation improved greatly when unified light and power systems operating at a common frequency were developed the same generating plant that fed large industrial loads during the day could feed commuter railway systems during rush hour and then serve lighting load in the evening thus improving the system load factor and reducing the cost of electrical energy overall many exceptions existed generating stations were dedicated to power or light by the choice of frequency and rotating frequency changers and rotating converters were particularly common to feed electric railway systems from the general lighting and power network throughout the first few decades of the 20th century central stations became larger using higher steam pressures to provide greater efficiency and relying on interconnections of multiple generating stations to improve reliability and cost high-voltage ac transmission allowed hydroelectric power to be conveniently moved from distant waterfalls to city markets the advent of the steam turbine in central station service around 1906 allowed great expansion of generating capacity generators were no longer limited by the power transmission of belts or the relatively slow speed of reciprocating engines and could grow to enormous sizes for example sebastian ziani de ferranti planned what would have been the largest reciprocating steam engine ever built for a proposed new central station but scrapped the plans when turbines became available in the necessary size building power systems out of central stations required combinations of engineering skill and financial acumen in equal measure pioneers of central station generation include george westinghouse and samuel insull in the united states ferranti and charles hesterman merz in uk and many others thermal power stationsedit in thermal power stations mechanical power is produced by a heat engine that transforms thermal energy often from combustion of a fuel into rotational energy most thermal power stations produce steam so they are sometimes called steam power stations not all thermal energy can be transformed into mechanical power according to the second law of thermodynamics therefore there is always heat lost to the environment if this loss is employed as useful heat for industrial processes or district heating the power plant is referred to as a cogeneration power plant or chp combined heat-and-power plant in countries where district heating is common there are dedicated heat plants called heat-only boiler stations an important class of power stations in the middle east uses by-product heat for the desalination of water the efficiency of a thermal power cycle is limited by the maximum working fluid temperature produced the efficiency is not directly a function of the fuel used for the same steam conditions coal- nuclear- and gas power plants all have the same theoretical efficiency overall if a system is on constantly base load it will be more efficient than one that is used intermittently peak load steam turbines generally operate at higher efficiency when operated at full capacity besides use of reject heat for process or district heating one way to improve overall efficiency of a power plant is to combine two different thermodynamic cycles in a combined cycle plant most commonly exhaust gases from a gas turbine are used to generate steam for a boiler and a steam turbine the combination of a top cycle and a bottom cycle produces higher overall efficiency than either cycle can attain alone classificationedit by heat sourceedit fossil-fuel power stations may also use a steam turbine generator or in the case of natural gas-fired plants may use a combustion turbine a coal-fired power station produces heat by burning coal in a steam boiler the steam drives a steam turbine and generator that then produces electricity the waste products of combustion include ash sulphur dioxide nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide some of the gases can be removed from the waste stream to reduce pollution nuclear power plants 5 use a nuclear reactors heat that is transferred to steam which then operates a steam turbine and generator about 20 percent of electric generation in the usa is produced by nuclear power plants geothermal power plants use steam extracted from hot underground rocks these rocks are heated by the decay of radioactive material in the earths crust biomass-fuelled power plants may be fuelled by waste from sugar cane municipal solid waste landfill methane or other forms of biomass in integrated steel mills blast furnace exhaust gas is a low-cost although low-energy-density fuel waste heat from industrial processes is occasionally concentrated enough to use for power generation usually in a steam boiler and turbine solar thermal electric plants use sunlight to boil water and produce steam which turns the generator by prime moveredit steam turbine plants use the dynamic pressure generated by expanding steam to turn the blades of a turbine almost all large non-hydro plants use this system about 90 percent of all electric power produced in the world is through use of steam turbines 6 gas turbine plants use the dynamic pressure from flowing gases air and combustion products to directly operate the turbine natural-gas fuelled and oil fueled combustion turbine plants can start rapidly and so are used to supply peak energy during periods of high demand though at higher cost than base-loaded plants these may be comparatively small units and sometimes completely unmanned being remotely operated this type was pioneered by the uk princetown 7 being the worlds first commissioned in 1959 combined cycle plants have both a gas turbine fired by natural gas and a steam boiler and steam turbine which use the hot exhaust gas from the gas turbine to produce electricity this greatly increases the overall efficiency of the plant and many new baseload power plants are combined cycle plants fired by natural gas internal combustion reciprocating engines are used to provide power for isolated communities and are frequently used for small cogeneration plants hospitals office buildings industrial plants and other critical facilities also use them to provide backup power in case of a power outage these are usually fuelled by diesel oil heavy oil natural gas and landfill gas microturbines stirling engine and internal combustion reciprocating engines are low-cost solutions for using opportunity fuels such as landfill gas digester gas from water treatment plants and waste gas from oil production by dutyedit power plants that can be dispatched scheduled to provide energy to a system include base load power plants run nearly continually to provide that component of system load that doesnt vary during a day or week baseload plants can be highly optimized for low fuel cost but may not start or stop quickly during changes in system load examples of base-load plants would include large modern coal-fired and nuclear generating stations or hydro plants with a predictable supply of water peaking power plants meet the daily peak load which may only be for one or two hours each day while their incremental operating cost is always higher than base load plants they are required to ensure security of the system during load peaks peaking plants include simple cycle gas turbines and sometimes reciprocating internal combustion engines which can be started up rapidly when system peaks are predicted hydroelectric plants may also be designed for peaking use load following power plants can economically follow the variations in the daily and weekly load at lower cost than peaking plants and with more flexibility than baseload plants non-dispatchable plants include such sources as wind and solar energy while their long-term contribution to system energy supply is predictable on a short-term daily or hourly base their energy must be used as available since generation cannot be deferred contractual arrangements take or pay with independent power producers or system interconnections to other networks may be effectively non-dispatchable cooling towersedit all thermal power plants produce waste heat energy as a byproduct of the useful electrical energy produced the amount of waste heat energy equals or exceeds the amount of energy converted into useful electricity gas-fired power plants can achieve as much as 65 percent conversion efficiency while coal and oil plants achieve around 30 to 49 percent the waste heat produces a temperature rise in the atmosphere which is small compared to that produced by greenhouse-gas emissions from the same power plant natural draft wet cooling towers at many nuclear power plants and large fossil fuel-fired power plants use large hyperboloid chimney-like structures as seen in the image at the right that release the waste heat to the ambient atmosphere by the evaporation of water however the mechanical induced-draft or forced-draft wet cooling towers in many large thermal power plants nuclear power plants fossil-fired power plants petroleum refineries petrochemical plants geothermal biomass and waste-to-energy plants use fans to provide air movement upward through downcoming water and are not hyperboloid chimney-like structures the induced or forced-draft cooling towers are typically rectangular box-like structures filled with a material that enhances the mixing of the upflowing air and the downflowing water 8 9 in areas with restricted water use a dry cooling tower or directly air-cooled radiators may be necessary since the cost or environmental consequences of obtaining make-up water for evaporative cooling would be prohibitive these coolers have lower efficiency and higher energy consumption to drive fans compared to a typical wet evaporative cooling tower once-through cooling systemsedit electric companies often prefer to use cooling water from the ocean a lake or a river or a cooling pond instead of a cooling tower this single pass or once-through cooling system can save the cost of a cooling tower and may have lower energy costs for pumping cooling water through the plants heat exchangers however the waste heat can cause thermal pollution as the water is discharged power plants using natural bodies of water for cooling are designed with mechanisms such as fish screens to limit intake of organisms into the cooling machinery these screens are only partially effective and as a result billions of fish and other aquatic organisms are killed by power plants each year 10 11 for example the cooling system at the indian point energy center in new york kills over a billion fish eggs and larvae annually 12 a further environmental impact is that aquatic organisms which adapt to the warmer discharge water may be injured if the plant shuts down in cold weather water consumption by power stations is a developing issue 13 in recent years recycled wastewater or grey water has been used in cooling towers the calpine riverside and the calpine fox power stations in wisconsin as well as the calpine mankato power station in minnesota are among these facilities power from renewable energyedit power stations can also generate electrical energy from renewable energy sources hydroelectric power stationedit in a hydroelectric power station water flows though turbines using hydropower to generate hydroelectricity power is captured from the gravitational force of water falling through penstocks to water turbines connected to generators the amount of power available is a combination of height and flow a wide range of dams may be built to raise the water level and create a lake for storing water hydropower is produced in 150 countries with the asia-pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010 china is the largest hydroelectricity producer with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010 representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use pumped storageedit a pumped-storage is a reversible hydroelectric power plant they are a net consumer of energy but can be used for storage to smooth peaks and troughs in overall electricity demand pumped storage plants typically use spare electricity during off peak periods to pump freshwater or saltwater from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir because the pumping takes place off peak electricity is typically cheaper than at peak times this is because power sources such as coal-fired solar and wind are not switched off and remain in service even when demand is low during hours of peak demand when the electricity price is high the water pumped to the upper reservoir is allowed to flow back to the lower reservoir through a water turbine connected to an electricity generator unlike coal power stations which can take more than 12 hours to start up from cold the hydroelectric plant can be brought into service in a few minutes ideal to meet a peak load demand two substantial pumped storage schemes are in south africa palmiet pumped storage scheme and another in the drakensberg ingula pumped storage scheme solaredit solar energy can be turned into electricity either directly in solar cells or in a concentrating solar power plant by focusing the light to run a heat engine a solar photovoltaic power plant converts sunlight into direct current electricity using the photoelectric effect inverters change the direct current into alternating current for connection to the electrical grid this type of plant does not use rotating machines for energy conversion solar thermal power plants are another type of solar power plant they use either parabolic troughs or heliostats to direct sunlight onto a pipe containing a heat transfer fluid such as oil the heated oil is then used to boil water into steam which turns a turbine that drives an electrical generator the central tower type of solar thermal power plant uses hundreds or thousands of mirrors depending on size to direct sunlight onto a receiver on top of a tower again the heat is used to produce steam to turn turbines that drive electrical generators windedit wind turbines can be used to generate electricity in areas with strong steady winds sometimes offshore many different designs have been used in the past but almost all modern turbines being produced today use a three-bladed upwind design grid-connected wind turbines now being built are much larger than the units installed during the 1970s they thus produce power more cheaply and reliably than earlier models with larger turbines on the order of one megawatt the blades move more slowly than older smaller units which makes them less visually distracting and safer for birds marineedit marine energy or marine power also sometimes referred to as ocean energy or ocean power refers to the energy carried by ocean waves tides salinity and ocean temperature differences the movement of water in the worlds oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy or energy in motion this energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes transport and industries the term marine energy encompasses both wave power  power from surface waves and tidal power  obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy as wind power is derived from the wind even if the wind turbines are placed over water the oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world 14 osmosisedit salinity gradient energy is called pressure-retarded osmosis in this method seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber that is at a pressure lower than the difference between the pressures of saline water and fresh water freshwater is also pumped into the pressure chamber through a membrane which increases both the volume and pressure of the chamber as the pressure differences are compensated a turbine is spun creating energy this method is being specifically studied by the norwegian utility statkraft which has calculated that up to 25 twhyr would be available from this process in norway statkraft has built the worlds first prototype osmotic power plant on the oslo fiord which was opened on november 24 2009 biomassedit biomass energy can be produced from combustion of waste green material to heat water into steam and drive a steam turbine bioenergy can also be processed through a range of temperatures and pressures in gasification pyrolysis or torrefaction reactions depending on the desired end product these reactions create more energy-dense products syngas wood pellets biocoal that can then be fed into an accompanying engine to produce electricity at a much lower emission rate when compared with open burning storage power stationsedit it is possible to store energy and produce the electricity at a later time like in pumped-storage hydroelectricity thermal energy storage flywheel energy storage battery storage power station and so on typical power outputedit the power generated by a power station is measured in multiples of the watt typically megawatts  106 watts or gigawatts  109 watts power stations vary greatly in capacity depending on the type of power plant and on historical geographical and economic factors the following examples offer a sense of the scale many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the usa as of 2011 the roscoe wind farm is the second largest onshore wind farm in the world producing 781.5 mw of power followed by the horse hollow wind energy center  735.5 mw as of july 2013 the london array in united kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 630 mw followed by thanet offshore wind project in united kingdom at 300 mw as of 2015update the largest photovoltaic pv power plants in the world are led by longyangxia dam solar park in china rated at 850 megawatts solar thermal power stations in the us have the following output large coal-fired nuclear and hydroelectric power stations can generate hundreds of megawatts to multiple gigawatts some examples gas turbine power plants can generate tens to hundreds of megawatts some examples the rated capacity of a power station is nearly the maximum electrical power that that power station can produce some power plants are run at almost exactly their rated capacity all the time as a non-load-following base load power plant except at times of scheduled or unscheduled maintenance however many power plants usually produce much less power than their rated capacity in some cases a power plant produces much less power than its rated capacity because it uses an intermittent energy source operators try to pull maximum available power from such power plants because their marginal cost is practically zero but the available power varies widelyin particular it may be zero during heavy storms at night in some cases operators deliberately produce less power for economic reasons the cost of fuel to run a load following power plant may be relatively high and the cost of fuel to run a peaking power plant is even higherthey have relatively high marginal costs operators keep power plants turned off operational reserve or running at minimum fuel consumptioncitation needed spinning reserve most of the time operators feed more fuel into load following power plants only when the demand rises above what lower-cost plants ie intermittent and base load plants can produce and then feed more fuel into peaking power plants only when the demand rises faster than the load following power plants can follow operationsedit the term power station is generally limited to those able to be despatched by a system operator ie the system operator can by one means or another alter the planned output of the generating facility 16 17 18 the power station operator has several duties in the electricity-generating facility operators are responsible for the safety of the work crews that frequently do repairs on the mechanical and electrical equipment they maintain the equipment with periodic inspections and log temperatures pressures and other important information at regular intervals operators are responsible for starting and stopping the generators depending on need they are able to synchronize and adjust the voltage output of the added generation with the running electrical system without upsetting the system they must know the electrical and mechanical systems in order to troubleshoot solvefix problems in the facility and add to the reliability of the facility operators must be able to respond to an emergency and know the procedures in place to deal with it see alsoedit energy portal cogeneration cooling tower cost of
