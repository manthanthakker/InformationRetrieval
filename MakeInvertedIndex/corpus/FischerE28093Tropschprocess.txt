fischertropsch process the fischertropsch process is a collection of chemical reactions that converts a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons it was first developed by franz fischer and hans tropsch at the kaiser-wilhelm-institut für kohlenforschung in mülheim an der ruhr germany in 1925 the process a key component of gas to liquids technology produces a synthetic lubrication oil and synthetic fuel typically from coal natural gas or biomass 1 the fischertropsch process has received intermittent attention as a source of low-sulfur diesel fuel and to address the supply or cost of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons a fischertropsch-type process has also been suggested to have produced a few of the building blocks of dna and rna within asteroids 2  contents 1

variety of hydrocarbons ideally having the formula cnh2n+2 the more useful reactions produce alkanes as follows where n is typically 10–20 the formation of methane n  1 is unwanted most of the alkanes produced tend to be straight-chain suitable as diesel fuel in addition to alkane formation competing reactions give small amounts of alkenes as well as alcohols and other oxygenated hydrocarbons 3 fischertropsch intermediates and elemental reactionsedit converting a mixture of h2 and co into aliphatic products obviously should be a multi-step reaction with several sorts of intermediates the growth of the hydrocarbon chain may be visualized as involving a repeated sequence in which hydrogen atoms are added to carbon and oxygen the co bond is split and a new cc bond is formed for one ch2 group produced by co  2h2  ch2  h2o several reactions are necessary associative adsorption of co splitting of the co bond dissociative adsorption of 2h2 transfer of 2h to the oxygen to yield h2o desorption of h2o transfer of 2h to the carbon to yield ch2 the conversion of co to alkanes involves hydrogenation of co the hydrogenolysis cleavage with h2 of co bonds and the formation of cc bonds such reactions are assumed to proceed via initial formation of surface-bound metal carbonyls the co ligand is speculated to undergo dissociation possibly into oxide and carbide ligands 4 other potential intermediates are various c1 fragments including formyl cho hydroxycarbene hcoh hydroxymethyl ch2oh methyl ch3 methylene ch2 methylidyne ch and hydroxymethylidyne coh furthermore and critical to the production of liquid fuels are reactions that form cc bonds such as migratory insertion many related stoichiometric reactions have been simulated on discrete metal clusters but homogeneous fischertropsch catalysts are poorly developed and of no commercial importance addition of isotopically labelled alcohol to the feed stream results in incorporation of alcohols into product this observation establishes the facility of co bond scission using 14c-labelled ethylene and propene over cobalt catalysts results in incorporation of these olefins into the growing chain chain growth reaction thus appears to involve both olefin insertion as well as co-insertion 5 feedstocks gasificationedit fischertropsch plants associated with coal or related solid feedstocks sources of carbon must first convert the solid fuel into gaseous reactants ie co h2 and alkanes this conversion is called gasification and the product is called synthesis gas syngas synthesis gas obtained from coal gasification tends to have a h2co ratio of ~0.7 compared to the ideal ratio of ~2 this ratio is adjusted via the water-gas shift reaction coal-based fischertropsch plants produce varying amounts of co2 depending upon the energy source of the gasification process however most coal-based plants rely on the feed coal to supply all the energy requirements of the fischertropsch process feedstocks gtledit carbon monoxide for ft catalysis is derived from hydrocarbons in gas to liquids gtl technology the hydrocarbons are low molecular weight materials that often would be discarded or flared stranded gas provides relatively cheap gas gtl is viable provided gas remains relatively cheaper than oil several reactions are required to obtain the gaseous reactants required for fischertropsch catalysis first reactant gases entering a fischertropsch reactor must be desulfurized otherwise sulfur-containing impurities deactivate poison the catalysts required for fischertropsch reactions 3 several reactions are employed to adjust the h2co ratio most important is the water gas shift reaction which provides a source of hydrogen at the expense of carbon monoxide 3 for fischertropsch plants that use methane as the feedstock another important reaction is steam reforming which converts the methane into co and h2 process conditionsedit generally the fischertropsch process is operated in the temperature range of 150–300c  302–572f higher temperatures lead to faster reactions and higher conversion rates but also tend to favor methane production for this reason the temperature is usually maintained at the low to middle part of the range increasing the pressure leads to higher conversion rates and also favors formation of long-chained alkanes both of which are desirable typical pressures range from one to several tens of atmospheres even higher pressures would be favorable but the benefits may not justify the additional costs of high-pressure equipment and higher pressures can lead to catalyst deactivation via coke formation a variety of synthesis-gas compositions can be used for cobalt-based catalysts the optimal h2co ratio is around 1.8–2.1 iron-based catalysts promote the water-gas-shift reaction and thus can tolerate lower ratios this reactivity can be important for synthesis gas derived from coal or biomass which tend to have relatively low h2co ratios  1 design of the fischer-tropsch process reactoredit efficient removal of heat from the reactor is the basic need of fischertropsch reactors since these reactions are characterized by high exothermicity four types of reactors are discussed product distributionedit in general the product distribution of hydrocarbons formed during the fischertropsch process follows an andersonschulzflory distribution 7 which can be expressed as where wn is the weight fraction of hydrocarbons containing n carbon atoms α is the chain growth probability or the probability that a molecule will continue reacting to form a longer chain in general α is largely determined by the catalyst and the specific process conditions examination of the above equation reveals that methane will always be the largest single product so long as α is less than 0.5 however by increasing α close to one the total amount of methane formed can be minimized compared to the sum of all of the various long-chained products increasing α increases the formation of long-chained hydrocarbons the very long-chained hydrocarbons are waxes which are solid at room temperature therefore for production of liquid transportation fuels it may be necessary to crack some of the fischertropsch products in order to avoid this some researchers have proposed using zeolites or other catalyst substrates with fixed sized pores that can restrict the formation of hydrocarbons longer than some characteristic size usually n 10 this way they can drive the reaction so as to minimize methane formation without producing lots of long-chained hydrocarbons such efforts have met with only limited success catalystsedit a variety of catalysts can be used for the fischertropsch process but the most common are the transition metals cobalt iron and ruthenium nickel can also be used but tends to favor methane formation methanation cobaltedit cobalt-based catalysts are highly active although iron may be more suitable for certain applications cobalt catalysts are more active for fischertropsch synthesis when the feedstock is natural gas natural gas has a high hydrogen to carbon ratio so the water-gas-shift is not needed for cobalt catalysts iron catalysts are preferred for lower quality feedstocks such as coal or biomass synthesis gases derived from these hydrogen-poor feedstocks has a low-hydrogen-content and require the watergas shift reaction unlike the other metals used for this process co ni ru which remain in the metallic state during synthesis iron catalysts tend to form a number of phases including various oxides and carbides during the reaction control of these phase transformations can be important in maintaining catalytic activity and preventing breakdown of the catalyst particles in addition to the active metal the catalysts typically contain a number of promoters including potassium and copper group 1 alkali metals including potassium are a poison for cobalt catalysts but are promoters for iron catalysts catalysts are supported on high-surface-area binderssupports such as silica alumina or zeolites 8 promotors also have an important influence on activity alkali metal oxides and copper are common promotors but the formulation depends on the primary metal iron vs cobalt 9 alkali oxides on cobalt catalysts generally cause activity to drop severely even with very low alkali loadings c≥5 and co2 selectivity increase while methane and c2c4 selectivity decrease in addition the alkene to alkane ratio increases fischertropsch catalysts are sensitive to poisoning by sulfur-containing compounds cobalt-based catalysts are more sensitive than for their iron counterparts ironedit fischertropsch iron catalysts need alkali promotion to attain high activity and stability eg 0.5 wt k 2o addition of cu for reduction promotion addition of sio 2 al 2o 3 for structural promotion and maybe some manganese can be applied for selectivity control eg high olefinicity the working catalyst is only obtained whenafter reduction with hydrogenin the initial period of synthesis several iron carbide phases and elemental carbon are formed whereas iron oxides are still present in addition to some metallic iron with iron catalysts two directions of selectivity have been pursued one direction has aimed at a low-molecular-weight olefinic hydrocarbon mixture to be produced in an entrained phase or fluid bed process sasolsynthol process due to the relatively high reaction temperature approx 340c the average molecular weight of the product is so low that no liquid product phase occurs under reaction conditions the catalyst particles moving around in the reactor are small particle diameter 100µm and carbon deposition on the catalyst does not disturb reactor operation thus a low catalyst porosity with small pore diameters as obtained from fused magnetite plus promoters after reduction with hydrogen is appropriate for maximising the overall gasoline yield c3 and c4 alkenes have been oligomerized at sasol however recovering the olefins for use as chemicals in eg polymerization processes is advantageous today the second direction of iron catalyst development has aimed at highest catalyst activity to be used at low reaction temperature where most of the hydrocarbon product is in the liquid phase under reaction conditions typically such catalysts are obtained through precipitation from nitrate solutions a high content of a carrier provides mechanical strength and wide pores for easy mass transfer of the reactants in the liquid product filling the pores the main product fraction then is a paraffin wax which is refined to marketable wax materials at sasol however it also can be very selectively hydrocracked to a high quality diesel fuel thus iron catalysts are very flexible rutheniumedit ruthenium is most active working at the lowest reaction temperature it produces the highest molecular weight hydrocarbons polymethylene synthesis pichler and buffleb performing thus the chain growth reaction in the cleanest mode it acts as a fischer tropsch catalyst as the pure metal without any promotors thus providing the simplest catalytic system of fischer tropsch synthesis where mechanistic conclusions should be the easiesteg much easier than with iron as the catalyst like with nickel the selectivity changes to mainly methane at elevated temperature its high price and limited world resources exclude industrial application systematic fischer tropsch studies with ruthenium catalysts should contribute substantially to the further exploration of the fundamentals of fischer tropsch synthesis there is an interesting question to consider what features have the metals nickel iron cobalt and ruthenium in common to let themand only thembe fischertropsch catalysts converting the coh2 mixture to aliphatic long chain hydrocarbons in a one step reaction the term one step reaction means that reaction intermediates are not desorbed from the catalyst surface in particular it is amazing that the much carbided alkalized iron catalyst gives this reaction similarly as the just metallic ruthenium catalyst it will be seen in the next section that the kinetic principle of selective inhibition might be the common feature which appliesin spite of differences in catalyst composition reaction intermediates steps of reaction and corresponding kinetic schemes  10 htft and ltftedit high-temperature fischertropsch or htft is operated at temperatures of 330–350c and uses an iron-based catalyst this process was used extensively by sasol in their coal-to-liquid plants ctl low-temperature fischertropsch ltft is operated at lower temperatures and uses an iron or cobalt-based catalyst this process is best known for being used in the first integrated gtl-plant operated and built by shell in bintulu malaysia 11 historyedit since the invention of the original process by fischer and tropsch working at the kaiser-wilhelm-institut for chemistry in the 1920s many refinements and adjustments were made fischer and tropsch filed a number of patents eg us patent 1,746,464 applied 1926 published 1930 12 it was commercialized by brabag in germany in 1936 being petroleum-poor but coal-rich germany used the fischertropsch process during world war ii to produce ersatz replacement fuels fischertropsch production accounted for an estimated 9 of german war production of fuels and 25 of the automobile fuel 13 the united states bureau of mines in a program initiated by the synthetic liquid fuels act employed seven operation paperclip synthetic fuel scientists in a fischertropsch plant in louisiana missouri in 1946 13 14 in britain alfred august aicher obtained several patents for improvements to the process in the 1930s and 1940s 15 aichers company was named synthetic oils ltd not related to a company of the same name in canadacitation needed commercializationedit the fischertropsch process has been applied in large-scale gasliquids and coalliquid facilities such as shells pearl gtl facility in ras laffan qatar such large facilities are susceptible to high capital costs high operation and maintenance costs the uncertain and volatile price of crude oil and the involvement of potentially environmentally damaging processes in particular the use of natural gas as a feedstock becomes practical only with use of stranded gas ie sources of natural gas far from major cities which are impractical to exploit with conventional gas pipelines and lng technology otherwise the direct sale of natural gas to consumers would become much more profitable several companies are developing the process to enable practical exploitation of so-called stranded gas reserves conventional ft reactors have been optimized for massive coal-to-liquids and gasliquid facilities such as shells pearl gtl facility these slurry bed and fixed-bed reactors are much larger than the sizes needed for biofuel facilities or for smaller-scale natural-gas fields the use of microchannel reactors such as those developed by velocys intensifies the reaction scales down the size of the reaction hardware and overcomes the heat and mass transport problems associated with conventional ft technology enhanced heat transfer inside the microchannels reactor allows for optimal temperature control which maximizes catalyst activity and life while no smaller scale plant is currently in commercial operation indications show capital costs operating costs and size could all be reduced relative to conventional ft facilities 16 17 in
