distributed generation distributed generation also distributed energy on-site generation osg 1 or districtdecentralized energy is generated or stored by a variety of small grid-connected devices referred to as distributed energy resources der or distributed energy resource systems 2 conventional power stations such as coal-fired gas and nuclear powered plants as well as hydroelectric dams and large-scale solar power stations are centralized and often require electricity to be transmitted over long distances by contrast der systems are decentralized modular and more flexible technologies that are located close to the load they serve albeit having capacities of only 10 megawatts mw or less these systems can comprise multiple generation and storage components in this instance they are referred to as hybrid power systems der systems typically use renewable energy sources including small hydro biomass biogas solar power wind power and geothermal power and increasingly play an important role for the electric power distribution system a grid-connected device for electricity storage can also be classified as a der system and is often called a distributed energy storage system dess by means of an interface der systems can be managed and coordinated within a smart grid distributed generation and storage enables collection of energy from many sources and may lower environmental impacts and improve security of supply microgrids are modern localized small-scale grids contrary to the traditional centralized electricity grid macrogrid microgrids can disconnect from the centralized grid and operate autonomously strengthen grid resilience and help mitigate grid disturbances they are typically low-voltage ac grids often use diesel generators and are installed by the community they serve microgrids increasingly employ a mixture of different distributed energy resources such as solar hybrid power systems which reduce the amount of emitted carbon significantly

flywheels 2.6.1 pv storage 2.6.2 vehicle-to-grid 2.6.3 flywheels overviewedit historically central plants have been an integral part of the electric grid in which large generating facilities are specifically located either close to resources or otherwise located far from populated load centers these in turn supply the traditional transmission and distribution td grid that distributes bulk power to load centers and from there to consumers these were developed when the costs of transporting fuel and integrating generating technologies into populated areas far exceeded the cost of developing td facilities and tariffs central plants are usually designed to take advantage of available economies of scale in a site-specific manner and are built as one-off custom projects these economies of scale began to fail in the late 1960s and by the start of the 21st century central plants could arguably no longer deliver competitively cheap and reliable electricity to more remote customers through the grid because the plants had come to cost less than the grid and had become so reliable that nearly all power failures originated in the gridcitation needed thus the grid had become the main driver of remote customers power costs and power quality problems which became more acute as digital equipment required extremely reliable electricity 3 4 efficiency gains no longer come from increasing generating capacity but from smaller units located closer to sites of demand 5 6 for example coal power plants are built away from cities to prevent their heavy air pollution from affecting the populace in addition such plants are often built near collieries to minimize the cost of transporting coal hydroelectric plants are by their nature limited to operating at sites with sufficient water flow low pollution is a crucial advantage of combined cycle plants that burn natural gas the low pollution permits the plants to be near enough to a city to provide district heating and cooling distributed energy resources are mass-produced small and less site-specific their development arose out of capital markets have come to realize that right-sized resources for individual customers distribution substations or microgrids are able to offer important but little-known economic advantages over central plants smaller units offered greater economies from mass-production than big ones could gain through unit size these increased valuedue to improvements in financial risk engineering flexibility security and environmental qualityof these resources can often more than offset their apparent cost disadvantages 7 dg vis-à-vis central plants must be justified on a life-cycle basis 8 unfortunately many of the direct and virtually all of the indirect benefits of dg are not captured within traditional utility cash-flow accounting 3 while the levelized cost of distributed generation dg is typically more expensive than conventional centralized sources on a kilowatt-hour basis this does not consider negative aspects of conventional fuels the additional premium for dg is rapidly declining as demand increases and technology progressescitation needed and sufficient and reliable demand may bring economies of scale innovation competition and more flexible financing that could make dg clean energy part of a more diversified futurecitation needed distributed generation reduces the amount of energy lost in transmitting electricity because the electricity is generated very near where it is used perhaps even in the same building this also reduces the size and number of power lines that must be constructed typical der systems in a feed-in tariff fit scheme have low maintenance low pollution and high efficiencies in the past these traits required dedicated operating engineers and large complex plants to reduce pollution however modern embedded systems can provide these traits with automated operation and renewables such as sunlight wind and geothermal this reduces the size of power plant that can show a profit grid parityedit grid parity occurs when an alternative energy source can generate electricity at a levelized cost lcoe that is less than or equal to the end consumers retail price reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without subsidies or government support since the 2010s grid parity for solar and wind has become a reality in a growing number of markets including australia several european countries and some states in the us 9 technologiesedit distributed energy resource der systems are small-scale power generation or storage technologies typically in the range of 1kw to 10,000kw 10 used to provide an alternative to or an enhancement of the traditional electric power system der systems typically are characterized by high initial capital costs per kilowatt 11 der systems also serve as storage device and are often called distributed energy storage systems dess 12 der systems may include the following devicestechnologies combined heat power chp also known as cogeneration or trigeneration fuel cells hybrid power systems solar hybrid and wind hybrid systems micro combined heat and power microchp microturbines photovoltaic systems typically rooftop solar pv reciprocating engines small wind power systems stirling engines or a combination of the above for example hybrid photovoltaic chp and battery systems can provide full electric power for single family residences without extreme storage expenses 13 cogenerationedit distributed cogeneration sources use steam turbines natural gas-fired fuel cells microturbines or reciprocating engines 14 to turn generators the hot exhaust is then used for space or water heating or to drive an absorptive chiller  15 16 for cooling such as air-conditioning in addition to natural gas-based schemes distributed energy projects can also include other renewable or low carbon fuels including biofuels biogas landfill gas sewage gas coal bed methane syngas and associated petroleum gas 17 delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64 of global sales the fuel cell micro combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012 18 20.000 units were sold in japan in 2012 overall within the ene farm project with a lifetime of around 60,000 hours for pem fuel cell units which shut down at night this equates to an estimated lifetime of between ten and fifteen years 19 for a price of $22,600 before installation 20 for 2013 a state subsidy for 50,000 units is in place 19 in addition molten carbonate fuel cell and solid oxide fuel cells using natural gas such as the ones from fuelcell energy and the bloom energy server or waste-to-energy processes such as the gate 5 energy system are used as a distributed energy resource solar poweredit photovoltaics by far the most important solar technology for distributed generation of solar power uses solar cells assembled into solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity it is a fast-growing technology doubling its worldwide installed capacity every couple of years pv systems range from distributed residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations to large centralized utility-scale photovoltaic power stations the predominant pv technology is crystalline silicon while thin-film solar cell technology accounts for about 10 percent of global photovoltaic deployment 21:18,19 in recent years pv technology has improved its sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency reduced the installation cost per watt as well as its energy payback time epbt and levelised cost of electricity lcoe and has reached grid parity in at least 19 different markets in 2014 22 as most renewable energy sources and unlike coal and nuclear solar pv is variable and non-dispatchable but has no fuel costs operating pollutionas well as greatly reduced mining-safety and operating-safety issues it produces peak power around local noon each day and its capacity factor is around 20 percent 23 wind poweredit wind turbines can be distributed energy resources or they can be built at utility scale these have low maintenance and low pollution but distributed wind unlike utility-scale wind has much higher costs than other sources of energy 24 as with solar wind energy is variable and non-dispatchable wind towers and generators have substantial insurable liabilities caused by high winds but good operating safety distributed generation from wind hybrid power systems combines wind power with other der systems one such example is the integration of wind turbines into solar hybrid power systems as wind tends to complement solar because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year hydro poweredit hydroelectricity is the most widely used form of renewable energy and its potential has already been explored to a large extent or is compromised due to issues such as environmental impacts on fisheries and increased demand for recreational access however using modern 21st century technology such as wave power can make large amounts of new hydropower capacity available with minor environmental impact modular and scalable next generation kinetic energy turbines can be deployed in arrays to serve the needs on a residential commercial industrial municipal or even regional scale microhydro kinetic generators neither require dams nor impoundments as they utilize the kinetic energy of water motion either waves or flow no construction is needed on the shoreline or sea bed which minimizes environmental impacts to habitats and simplifies the permitting process such power generation also has minimal environmental impact and non-traditional microhydro applications can be tethered to existing construction such as docks piers bridge abutments or similar structures 25 waste-to-energyedit municipal solid waste msw and natural waste such as sewage sludge food waste and animal manure will decompose and discharge methane-containing gas that can be collected and used as fuel in gas turbines or micro turbines to produce electricity as a distributed energy resource additionally a california-based company gate 5 energy partners inc has developed a process that transforms natural waste materials such as sewage sludge into biofuel that can be combusted to power a steam turbine that produces power this power can be used in lieu of grid-power at the waste source such as a treatment plant farm or dairy energy storageedit a distributed energy resource is not limited to the generation of electricity but may also include a device to store distributed energy de 12 distributed energy storage systems dess applications include several types of battery pumped hydro compressed air and thermal energy storage 26:42 access to energy storage for commercial applications is easily accessible through programs such as energy storage as a service esaas pv storageedit vehicle-to-gridedit flywheelsedit integration with the gridedit for reasons of reliability distributed generation resources would be interconnected to the same transmission grid as central stations various technical and economic issues occur in the integration of these resources into a grid technical problems arise in the areas of power quality voltage stability harmonics reliability protection and control 31 behavior of protective devices on the grid must be examined for all combinations of distributed and central station generation 32 a large scale deployment of distributed generation may affect grid-wide functions such as frequency control and allocation of reserves 33 as a result smart grid functions virtual power plants  34 35 36 and grid energy storage such as power to gas stations are added to the grid each distributed generation resource has its own integration issues solar pv and wind power both have intermittent and unpredictable generation so they create many stability issues for voltage and frequency these voltage issues affect mechanical grid equipment such as load tap changers which respond too often and wear out much more quickly than utilities anticipated 37 also without any form of energy storage during times of high solar generation companies must rapidly increase generation around the time of sunset to compensate for the loss of solar generation this high ramp rate produces what the industry terms the duck curve example that is a major concern for grid operators in the future 38 storage can fix these issues if it can be implemented flywheels have shown to provide excellent frequency regulation 39 short term use batteries at a large enough scale of use can help to flatten the duck curve and prevent generator use fluctuation and can help to maintain voltage profile 40 however cost is a major limiting factor for energy storage as each technique is prohibitively expensive to produce at scale and comparatively not energy dense compared to liquid fossil fuels finally another necessary method of aiding in integration of photovoltaics for proper distributed generation is in the use of intelligent hybrid inverters another approach does not demand grid integration stand alone hybrid systems stand alone hybrid systemsedit it is now possible to combine technologies such as photovoltaics batteries and cogen to make stand alone distributed generation systems 41 recent work has shown that such systems have a low levelized cost of electricity 42 many authors now think that these technologies may enable a mass-scale grid defection because consumers can produce electricity using off grid systems primarily made up of solar photovoltaic technology 43 44 45 for example the rocky mountain institute has proposed that there may wide scale grid defection 46 this is backed up by studies in the midwest 47 cost factorsedit cogenerators are also more expensive per watt than central generatorscitation needed they find favor because most buildings already burn fuels and the cogeneration can extract more value from the fuel  local production has no electricity transmission losses on long distance power lines or energy losses from the joule effect in transformers where in general 8-15 of the energy is lost 48 see also cost of electricity by source some larger installations utilize combined cycle generation usually this consists of a gas turbine whose exhaust boils water for a steam turbine in a rankine cycle the condenser of the steam cycle provides the heat for space heating or an absorptive chiller combined cycle plants with cogeneration have the highest known thermal efficiencies often exceeding 85 in countries with high pressure gas distribution small turbines can be used to bring the gas pressure to domestic levels whilst extracting useful energy if the uk were to implement this countrywide an additional 2-4gwe would become available note that the energy is already being generated elsewhere to provide the high initial gas pressure - this method simply distributes the energy via a different route microgridedit a microgrid is a localized grouping of electricity generation energy storage and loads that normally operates connected to a traditional centralized grid macrogrid this single point of common coupling with the macrogrid can be disconnected the microgrid can then function autonomously 49 generation and loads in a microgrid are usually interconnected at low voltage and it can operate in dc ac or the combination of both according to the recent developments in renewable energy systems storage systems and the nature of newly emerging loads there have been some researches for comparing the efficiency and performance of ac and dc microgrids 50 from the point of view of the grid operator a connected microgrid can be controlled as if it were one entity microgrid generation resources can include stationary batteries fuel cells solar wind or other energy sources the multiple dispersed generation sources and ability to isolate the microgrid from a larger network would provide highly reliable electric power produced heat from generation sources such as microturbines could be used for local process heating or space heating allowing flexible trade off between the needs for heat and electric power micro-grids were proposed in the wake of the july 2012 india blackout 51 small micro-grids covering 30–50km radius 51 small power stations of 5–10mw to serve the micro-grids generate power locally to reduce dependence on long distance transmission lines and cut transmission losses gtm research forecasts microgrid capacity in the united states will exceed 1.8 gigawatts by 2018 52 communication in der systemsedit iec
