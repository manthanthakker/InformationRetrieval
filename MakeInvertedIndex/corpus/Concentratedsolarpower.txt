concentrated solar power concentrated solar power also called concentrating solar power concentrated solar thermal and csp systems generate solar power by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight or solar thermal energy onto a small area electricity is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat which drives a heat engine usually a steam turbine connected to an electrical power generator  1 2 3 or powers a thermochemical reaction experimental as of 2013update 4 5 6 csp is being widely commercialized and the csp market saw about 740 megawatt mw of generating capacity added between 2007 and the end of 2010 more than half of this about 478mw was installed during 2010 bringing the global total to 1095mw spain added 400mw in 2010 taking the global lead with a total of 632mw while the us ended the year with 509mw after adding 78mw including two fossilcsp hybrid plants 7 the middle east is also ramping up their plans to install csp based projects and as a part of that plan shams-i which was the largest csp project in the world has been installed in abu dhabi by masdar 8 the largest csp project in the world until january 2016 is noor in morocco 9 and global operational power stands at 4,705mw there is considerable academic and commercial interest internationally in a new form of csp called stem for off-grid applications to produce 24-hour industrial scale power for mining sites and remote communities in italy other parts of europe australia asia north africa and latin america stem uses fluidized silica sand as a thermal storage and heat transfer medium for csp systems it has been developed by salerno-based magaldi industries the first commercial application of stem was scheduled to take place in sicily from 2015 10 csp growth is expected to continue at a fast pace as of january 2014 spain had a total capacity of 2,300mw making this country the world leader in csp united states follows with 1,740mw interest is also notable in north africa and the middle east as well as india and china in italy a handful of companies are trying to get authorization for 14 plants totalling 392mw despite a strong local and political opposition 11 the global market has been dominated by parabolic-trough plants which account for 90 of csp plants 7 csp is not to be confused with concentrator photovoltaics cpv in cpv the concentrated sunlight is converted directly to electricity via the photovoltaic effect ivanpah in california is running 69 percent below advertised power output and one spanish company abengoa that commercialized csp both in the us and abroad is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy csp technologies currently cannot compete on price with photovoltaics solar panels which have experienced huge growth in recent years due to falling prices of the panels 12 another drawback of ivanpah is that it lacks thermal energy storage one of the big advantages that csp has over pv and most other renewables which require either large scale energy storage systems like pumped hydro or fast acting natural gas power plants to be there as backup for those times when they are not producing much energy  contents 1 history 2

legend has it that archimedes used a burning glass to concentrate sunlight on the invading roman fleet and repel them from syracuse in 1973 a greek scientist dr ioannis sakkas curious about whether archimedes could really have destroyed the roman fleet in 212 bc lined up nearly 60 greek sailors each holding an oblong mirror tipped to catch the suns rays and direct them at a tar-covered plywood silhouette 160 feet away the ship caught fire after a few minutes however historians continue to doubt the archimedes story 13 in 1866 auguste mouchout used a parabolic trough to producе steam for the first solar steam engine the first patent for a solar collector was obtained by the italian alessandro battaglia in genoa italy in 1886 over the following years invеntors such as john ericsson and frank shuman developed concentrating solar-powered dеvices for irrigation refrigеration and locomоtion in 1913 shuman finished a 55hp parabolic solar thermal energy station in maadi egypt for irrigation 14 15 16 17 the first solar-power system using a mirror dish was built by dr rh goddard who was already well known for his research on liquid-fueled rockets and wrote an article in 1929 in which he asserted that all the previous obstacles had been addressed 18 professor giovanni francia  1911–1980 designed and built the first concentrated-solar plant which entered into operation in santilario near genoa italy in 1968 this plant had the architecture of todays concentrated-solar plants with a solar receiver in the center of a field of solar collectors the plant was able to produce 1mw with superheated steam at 100 bar and 500c 19 the 10mw solar one power tower was developed in southern california in 1981 but the parabolic-trough technology of the nearby solar energy generating systems segs begun in 1984 was more workable the 354mw segs is still the largest solar power plant in the world and will remain so until the 390mw ivanpah power tower project reaches full power current technologyedit csp is used to produce electricity sometimes called solar thermoelectricity usually generated through steam concentrated-solar technology systems use mirrors or lenses with tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight onto a small area the concentrated light is then used as heat or as a heat source for a conventional power plant solar thermoelectricity the solar concentrators used in csp systems can often also be used to provide industrial process heating or cooling such as in solar air-conditioning concentrating technologies exist in five common forms namely parabolic trough enclosed trough dish stirlings concentrating linear fresnel reflector and solar power tower 20 although simple these solar concentrators are quite far from the theoretical maximum concentration 21 22 for example the parabolic-trough concentration gives about  of the theoretical maximum for the design acceptance angle that is for the same overall tolerances for the system approaching the theoretical maximum may be achieved by using more elaborate concentrators based on nonimaging optics 21 22 23 different types of concentrators produce different peak temperatures and correspondingly varying thermodynamic efficiencies due to differences in the way that they track the sun and focus light new innovations in csp technology are leading systems to become more and more cost-effective 24 parabolic troughedit a parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflectors focal line the receiver is a tube positioned directly above the middle of the parabolic mirror and filled with a working fluid the reflector follows the sun during the daylight hours by tracking along a single axis a working fluid eg molten salt 25 is heated to 150–350c  300–660f as it flows through the receiver and is then used as a heat source for a power generation system 26 trough systems are the most developed csp technology the solar energy generating systems segs plants in california the worlds first commercial parabolic trough plants accionas nevada solar one near boulder city nevada and andasol europes first commercial parabolic trough plant are representative along with plataforma solar de almerías ssps-dcs test facilities in spain 27 enclosed troughedit enclosed trough systems are used to absorb heat rather than process heat the design encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouse-like glasshouse the glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system 28 lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended from the ceiling of the glasshouse by wires a single-axis tracking system positions the mirrors to retrieve the optimal amount of sunlight the mirrors concentrate the sunlight and focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes also suspended from the glasshouse structure 29 water is carried throughout the length of the pipe which is boiled to generate steam when intense solar radiation is applied sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on the mirrors 28 glasspoint solar the company that created the enclosed trough design states its technology can produce heat for enhanced oil recovery eor for about $5 per million british thermal units in sunny regions compared to between $10 and $12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies 30 solar power toweredit a solar power tower consists of an array of dual-axis tracking reflectors heliostats that concentrate sunlight on a central receiver atop a tower the receiver contains a fluid deposit which can consist of sea water the working fluid in the receiver is heated to 500–1000c  773–1,273k  932–1,832f and then used as a heat source for a power generation or energy storage system 26 an advantage of the solar tower is the reflectors can be adjusted instead of the whole tower power-tower development is less advanced than trough systems but they offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability the solar two in daggett california and the cesa-1 in plataforma solar de almeria almeria spain are the most representative demonstration plants the planta solar 10 ps10 in sanlucar la mayor spain is the first commercial utility-scale solar power tower in the world the 377mw ivanpah solar power facility located in the mojave desert is the largest csp facility in the world and uses three power towers 31 the national solar thermal test facility nsttf located in albuquerque nm is an experimental solar thermal test facility with a heliostat field capable of producing 6mw fresnel reflectorsedit fresnel reflectors are made of many thin flat mirror strips to concentrate sunlight onto tubes through which working fluid is pumped flat mirrors allow more reflective surface in the same amount of space as a parabolic reflector thus capturing more of the available sunlight and they are much cheaper than parabolic reflectors fresnel reflectors can be used in various size csps 32 33 dish stirlingedit a dish stirling or dish engine system consists of a stand-alone parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned at the reflectors focal point the reflector tracks the sun along two axes the working fluid in the receiver is heated to 250–700c  480–1,300f and then used by a stirling engine to generate power 26 parabolic-dish systems provide high solar-to-electric efficiency between 31 and 32 and their modular nature provides scalability the stirling energy systems ses united sun systems uss and science applications international corporation saic dishes at unlv and australian national universitys big dish in canberra australia are representative of this technology a world record for solar to electric efficiency was set at 31.25 by ses dishes at the national solar thermal test facility nsttf in new mexico on january 31 2008 a cold bright day 34 according to its developer ripasso energy a swedish firm in 2015 its dish sterling system being tested in the kalahari desert in south africa showed 34 efficiency 35 the ses installation in maricopa phoenix was the largest stirling dish power installation in the world until it was sold to united sun systems subsequently larger parts of the installation have been moved to china as part of the huge energy demand large air mass solar poweredit a concentrated solar power process developed in 2015 whereby a the temperature of a large contained mass of air is varied by a relatively small amounts this method has the potential to be an extremely efficient way to both harness and store solar power since the expansive and contractive forces generated by the large air mass can be directly used to fill reservoirs this process could make practical the construction of coastal reservoirs powered by seawater solar thermal enhanced oil recoveryedit heat from the sun can be used to provide steam used to make heavy oil less viscous and easier to pump solar power tower and parabolic troughs can be used to provide the steam which is used directly so no generators are required and no electricity is produced solar thermal enhanced oil recovery can extend the life of oilfields with very thick oil which would not otherwise be economical to pump deployment around the worldedit the commercial deployment of csp plants started by 1984 in the us with the segs plants the last segs plant was completed in 1990 from 1991 to 2005 no csp plants were built anywhere in the world global installed csp-capacity has increased nearly tenfold since 2004 and grew at an average of 50 percent per year during the last five years 37:51 in 2013 worldwide installed capacity increased by 36 percent or nearly 0.9 gigawatt gw to more than 3.4gw spain and the united states remained the global leaders while the number of countries with installed csp were growing there is a notable trend towards developing countries and regions with high solar radiation csp is also increasingly competing with the cheaper photovoltaic solar power and with concentrator photovoltaics cpv a fast-growing technology that just like csp is suited best for regions of high solar insolation 38 39 in addition a novel solar cpvcsp hybrid system has been proposed recently 40 efficiencyedit the conversion efficiency η displaystyle eta  of the incident solar radiation into mechanical work  without considering the ultimate conversion step into electricity by a power generator  depends on the thermal radiation properties of the solar receiver and on the heat engine eg steam turbine solar irradiation is first converted into heat by the solar receiver with the efficiency η r e c e i v e r displaystyle eta receiver and subsequently the heat is converted into work by the heat engine with the efficiency η c a r n o t displaystyle eta carnot  using carnots principle 43 44 for a solar receiver providing a heat source at temperature th and a heat sink at room temperature t the overall conversion efficiency can be calculated as follows for a solar flux i eg i  1000 wm2 concentrated c times with an efficiency η o p t i c s displaystyle eta optics on the system solar receiver with a collecting area a and an absorptivity α displaystyle alpha   for simplicitys sake one can assume that the losses are only radiative ones a fair assumption for high temperatures thus for a reradiating area a and an emissivity ϵ displaystyle epsilon  applying the stefan-boltzmann law yields simplifying these equations by considering perfect optics  η o p t i c s displaystyle eta mathrm optics   1 collecting and reradiating areas equal and maximum absorptivity and emissivity  α displaystyle alpha   1 ϵ displaystyle epsilon   1 then substituting in the first equation gives  the graph shows that the overall efficiency does not increase steadily with the receivers temperature although the heat engines efficiency carnot increases with higher temperature the receivers efficiency does not on the contrary the receivers efficiency is decreasing as the amount of energy it cannot absorb qlost grows by the fourth power as a function of temperature hence there is a maximum reachable temperature when the receiver efficiency is null blue curve on the figure below tmax is t m a x   i c σ  0.25 displaystyle tmathrm max leftfrac icsigma right{0.25 there is a temperature topt for which the efficiency is maximum ie when the efficiency derivative relative to the receiver temperature is null consequently this leads us to the following equation solving this equation numerically allows us to obtain the optimum process temperature according to the solar concentration ratio c red curve on the figure below  theoretical efficiencies aside real-world experience of csp reveals a 25-60 percent shortfall in projected production a pilot 5 megawatt csp power tower solar one was converted to a 10 megawatt csp power tower solar two decommissioned in 1999 due to the success of solar two a commercial power plant called solar tres power tower was built in spain renamed gemasolar thermosolar plant gemasolar brilliant results have paved the way for the crescent dunes project ivanpah difficulties arise also from not having considered the lessons about the benefits of thermal storage solana in arizona is 25 percent below projected numbers ivanpah in california is 40 percent below projected numbers a slightly bigger photovoltaic power station like the 290mw agua caliente solar project peaked at most to 741gwh in 2014 comparing with the 280mw solana growing 719gwh lower insolation related to a solar minimum is part of the problem but there is clearly a technical issue with rating these systems or simply a commercial overstatement indeed an other operator that of the 280mw genesis solar projected only 580gwh production and instead made 621gwh in 2015 csp once thought to be economically superior to photovoltaics in 2015 it has proven not to be the case recent pv commercial power is selling for  recent csp contracts 45 46 costsedit as of 9 september 2009update the cost of building a csp station was typically about us$2.50 to $4 per watt 47 while the fuel the suns radiation is free thus a 250mw csp station would have cost $600–1000 million to build that works out to $0.12 to 0.18 usdkwh 47 new csp stations may be economically competitive with fossil fuels nathaniel bullard a solar analyst at bloomberg new energy finance has calculated that the cost of electricity at the ivanpah solar power facility a project under construction in southern california will be lower than that from photovoltaic power and about the same as that from natural gas 48 however in november 2011 google announced that they would not invest further in csp projects due to the rapid price decline of photovoltaics google invested us$168 million on brightsource 49 50 irena has published on june 2012 a series of studies titled renewable energy cost analysis the csp study shows the cost of both building and operation of csp plants costs are expected to decrease but there are insufficient installations to clearly establish the learning curve as of march 2012 there were 1.9gw of csp installed with 1.8gw of that being parabolic trough 51 incentivesedit spainedit solar-thermal electricity generation is eligible for feed-in tariff payments art 2 rd 661/2007 if the system capacity does not

projects for the feed-in-tariff 53 54 projects currently accepted are not affected except that a 6 tax on feed-in-tariffs has been adopted effectively reducing the feed-in-tariff 55 australiaedit at the federal level under the large-scale renewable energy target lret in operation under the renewable energy electricity act 2000 large scale solar thermal electricity generation from accredited ret power stations may be entitled to create large-scale generation certificates lgcs these certificates can then be sold and transferred to liable entities usually electricity retailers to meet their obligations under this tradeable certificates scheme however as this legislation is technology neutral in its operation it tends to favour more established re technologies with a lower levelised cost of generation such as large scale onshore wind rather than solar thermal and csp 56 at state level renewable energy feed-in laws typically are capped by maximum generation capacity in kwp and are open only to micro or medium scale generation and in a number of instances are only open to solar pv photovoltaic generation this means that larger scale csp projects would not be eligible for payment for feed-in incentives in many of the state and territory jurisdictions futureedit a study done by greenpeace international the european solar thermal electricity association and the international energy agencys solarpaces group investigated the potential and future of concentrated solar power the study found that concentrated solar power could account for up to 25 of the worlds energy needs by 2050 the increase in investment would be from 2 billion euros worldwide to 92.5 billion euros in that time period 57 spain is the leader in concentrated solar power technology with more than 50 government-approved projects in the works also it exports its technology further increasing the technologys stake in energy worldwide because the technology works best with areas of high insolation solar radiation experts predict the biggest growth in places like africa mexico and the southwest united states it indicates that the thermal storage systems based in nitrates calcium potassium sodium will make the csp plants more and more profitable the study examined three different outcomes for this technology no increases in csp technology investment continuing as it has been in spain and the us and finally the true potential of csp without any barriers on its growth the findings of the third part are shown in the table below finally the study acknowledged how technology for csp was improving and how this would result in a drastic price decrease by 2050 it predicted a drop from the current range of €0.23–0.15kwh to €0.14–0.10kwh 57 recently the eu has begun to look into developing a €400 billion $774 billion network of solar power plants based in the sahara region using csp technology known as desertec to create a new carbon-free network linking europe the middle east and north africa the plan is backed mainly by german industrialists and predicts production of 15 of europes power by 2050 morocco is a major partner in desertec and as it has barely 1 of the electricity consumption of the eu it will produce more than enough energy for the entire country with a large energy surplus to deliver to europe 58 algeria has the biggest area of desert and private algerian firm cevital has signed up for desertec 58 with its wide desert the highest csp potential in the mediterranean and middle east regions  about 170 twhyear and its strategic geographical location near europe algeria is one of the key countries to ensure the success of desertec project moreover with the abundant natural-gas reserve in the algerian desert this will strengthen the technical potential of algeria in acquiring solar-gas hybrid power plants for 24-hour electricity generation other organizations expect csp to cost $0.06uskwh by 2015 due to efficiency improvements and mass production of equipment 59 that would make csp as cheap as conventional power investors such as venture capitalist vinod khosla expect csp to continuously reduce costs and actually be cheaper than coal power after 2015 on 9september 2009 7 years ago 2009-09-09 bill weihl googleorgs green-energy spokesperson said that the firm was conducting research on the heliostat mirrors and gas turbine technology which he expects will drop the cost of solar thermal electric power to less than $0.05kwh in 2 or 3 years 47 in 2009 scientists at the national renewable energy laboratory nrel and skyfuel teamed to develop large curved sheets of metal that have the potential to be 30 less expensive than todays best collectors of concentrated solar power by replacing glass-based models with a silver polymer sheet that has the same performance as the heavy glass mirrors but at much lower cost and weight it also is much easier to deploy and install the glossy film uses several layers of polymers with an inner layer of pure silver telescope designer roger angel univ of arizona has turned his attention to cpv and is a partner in a company called rehnu angel utilizes a spherical concentrating lens with large-telescope technologies but much cheaper materials and mechanisms to create efficient systems 60 recent experience with csp technology in 2014 - 2015 at solana in arizona and ivanpah in nevada indicate large production shortfalls in electricity generation between 25 and 40 percent producers blame clouds and stormy weather but critics seem to think there are technological issues these problems are causing utilities to pay inflated prices for wholesale electricity and threaten the long-term viability of the technology as photovoltaic costs continue to plummet many think csp has a limited future in utility-scale electricity production 61 on the other side part of photovoltaic costs drop is the result of the fossil fuel cost reductions which still powers most of pv production instead csp would be unaffected when fossil prices return to higher quotes very large scale solar power plantsedit there are several proposals for gigawatt size very large scale solar power plants they include the euro-mediterranean desertec proposal project helios in greece  10 gigawatt and ordos  2 gigawatt in china a 2003 study concluded that the world could generate 2,357,840 twh each year from very large scale solar power plants using 1 of each of the worlds deserts total consumption worldwide was 15,223 twhyear 62 in 2003 the gigawatt size projects are arrays of single plants the largest single plant in operation is the 370mw ivanpah solar in 2012 the blm made available 97,921,069 acres  39,627,251 hectares of land in the southwestern united states for solar projects enough for between 10,000 and 20,000 gigawatts gw 63 effect on wildlifeedit it has been noted that insects can be attracted to the bright light caused by concentrated solar technology and as a result birds that hunt them can be killed burned if the birds fly near the point where light is being focused onto this can also affect raptors who hunt the birds 64 65 66 67 federal wildlife officials have begun calling these power towers mega traps for wildlife 68 69 70 however the story about the ivanpah solar power facility was exaggerated numbering the deaths in many tens of thousands spreading alarm about concentrated solar power csp plants which was not grounded in facts but on one opponents speculation according to rigorous reporting in over six months actually only 133 singed birds were counted 71 by focusing no more than 4 mirrors on any one place in the air during standby at crescent dunes solar energy project in 3 months the death rate dropped to zero fatalities 72 see alsoedit
