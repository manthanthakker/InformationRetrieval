sabatier reaction the sabatier reaction or sabatier process was discovered by the french chemist paul sabatier in the 1910s it involves the reaction of hydrogen with carbon dioxide at elevated temperatures optimally 300â€“400c and pressures in the presence of a nickel catalyst to produce methane and water optionally ruthenium on alumina aluminium oxide makes a more efficient catalyst it is described by the following exothermic reaction  contents 1 energy storage 2 international space station life support 3 manufacturing propellant on mars 3.1 detailed chemical reactions 4 see also 5 references 6 external links 3.1 detailed chemical reactions  energy storageedit it has been proposed in a renewable-energy-dominated energy system to use the excess electricity generated by wind solar photovoltaic hydro marine current etc to make methane natural gas via water electrolysis and the subsequent application of the sabatier reaction 1 2 in contrast to a direct usage of hydrogen for transport or energy storage applications 3 the methane can be injected into the existing gas network which in many countries has one or two years of gas storage capacity the methane can then be used on demand to generate electricity and heatcombined heat and power overcoming low points of renewable energy production the process is electrolysis of water by electricity to create hydrogen which can partly be used directly in fuel cells and the addition of carbon dioxide co2 sabatier process to create methane the co2 can be extracted from the air or fossil fuel waste gases by the amine process amongst many others it is a low-co2 system and has similar efficiencies of todays energy system a 6 mw power-to-gas plant went into production in germany in 2013 and power a fleet of 1500 audi a3s 4 international space station life supportedit oxygen generators on board the international space station produce oxygen from water using electrolysis the hydrogen produced was previously discarded into space as astronauts consume oxygen carbon dioxide is produced which must then be removed from the air and discarded as well this approach required copious amounts of water to be regularly transported to the space station for oxygen generation in addition to that used for human consumption hygiene and other usesa luxury that will not be available to future long-duration missions beyond low earth orbit nasa is using the sabatier reaction to recover water from exhaled carbon dioxide and the hydrogen previously discarded from electrolysis on the international space station and possibly for future missions 5 the other resulting chemical methane is released into space as half of the input hydrogen becomes wasted as methane additional hydrogen is supplied from earth to make up the difference however this creates a nearly-closed cycle between water oxygen and carbon dioxide which only requires a relatively modest amount of imported hydrogen to maintain ignoring other results of respiration this cycle looks likecitation needed the loop could be further closed if the waste methane was separated into its component parts by pyrolysis the released hydrogen would then be recycled back into the sabatier reactor leaving an easily removed deposit of pyrolytic graphite the reactor would be little more than a steel pipe and could be periodically serviced by an astronaut where the deposit is chiselled outcitation needed alternatively the loop could be partially closed  75 of h2 from ch4 recovered by incomplete pyrolysis of the waste methane while keeping the carbon locked up in gaseous form 6 the bosch reaction is also being investigated by nasa for this purpose and is 7 the bosch reaction would present a completely closed hydrogen and oxygen cycle which only produces atomic carbon as waste however difficulties maintaining its temperature of up to 600c and properly handling carbon deposits mean significantly more research will be required before a bosch reactor could become a reality one problem is that the production of elemental carbon tends to foul the catalysts surface which is detrimental to the reactions efficiency manufacturing propellant on marsedit the sabatier reaction has been proposed as a key step in reducing the cost of manned exploration of mars mars direct interplanetary transport system through in-situ resource utilization hydrogen is combined with co2 from the atmosphere with methane then stored as fuel and the water side product electrolyzed yielding oxygen to be liquefied and stored as oxidizer and hydrogen to be recycled back into the reactor the original hydrogen could be transported from earth or separated from martian sources of water 8 a variation of the basic sabatier methanation reaction may be used via a mixed catalyst bed and a reverse water gas shift in a single reactor to produce methane from the raw materials available on mars utilizing water from the martian subsoil and carbon dioxide in the martian atmosphere a 2011 prototype test operation that harvested co2 from a simulated martian atmosphere and reacted it with h2 produced methane rocket propellant at a rate of 1kgday operating autonomously for 5 consecutive days maintaining a nearly 100 conversion rate an optimized system of this design massing 50kg is projected to produce 1 kgday of o2ch4 propellant  with a methane purity of 98 while consuming 700 watts of electrical power overall unit conversion rate expected from the optimized system is one tonne of propellant per 17 mwh energy input 9 detailed chemical reactionsedit the stoichiometric ratio of oxidizer and fuel is 2:1 for an oxygenmethane engine ch4  2 o2  co2  2 h2o however one pass through the sabatier reactor produces a ratio of only 1:1 more oxygen may be produced by running the water gas shift reaction in reverse effectively extracting oxygen from the atmosphere by reducing carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide another option is to make more methane than needed and pyrolyze the excess of it into carbon and hydrogen see above section where the hydrogen is recycled back into the reactor to produce further methane and water in an automated system the carbon deposit may be removed by blasting with hot martian co2 oxidizing the carbon into carbon monoxide which is ventedoriginal research a fourth solution to the stoichiometry problem would be to combine the sabatier reaction with the reverse water gas-shift reaction in a single reactor as followscitation needed 3 co2  6 h2  ch4  2 co  4 h2o this reaction is slightly exothermic and when the water is electrolyzed an oxygen to methane ratio of 2:1 is obtained regardless of which method of oxygen fixation is utilized the overall process can be summarized by the following equationcitation needed 2 h2  3 co2  ch4  2 o2  2 co looking at molecular masses we have produced sixteen grams of methane and 64 grams of oxygen using four grams of hydrogen which would have to be imported from earth unless martian water was electrolysed for a mass gain of 20:1 and the methane and oxygen are in the right stochiometric ratio to be burned in a rocket engine this kind of in-situ resource utilization would result in massive weight and cost savings to any proposed manned mars or sample return missions see alsoedit in-situ resource utilization timeline of hydrogen technologies steam reforming
