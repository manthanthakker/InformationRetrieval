transmission systems consumers interests are their interests taken as a whole including their interests in the reduction of greenhouse gases and in the security of the supply of gas and electricity to them 6 since 2010 the authority has imposed nearly £100million in fines and redress levies against energy suppliers including a £12million redress levy on eon in may 2014 7 and a £1 million redress

development of competition in the uk marketedit the liberalisation and privatisation of the energy markets in the united kingdom began with the margaret thatcher government in the 1980s often called the thatcher-lawson agenda due to the key role of nigel lawson in the thatcher government cabinet aspects of the ofgem model have been adopted by eu legislation 10 starting in the 1990s the supply of electricity and gas to end consumers in the uk has been unbundled from the rest of the industry at the time of privatisation british gas and one regional public electricity supplier pes held a monopoly on supplying all domestic gas and electricity consumers respectively in great britain between 1996 and 1999 domestic energy consumers gradually got the freedom to choose their supplier and finally in may 1998 the domestic gas market was fully opened to competition closely followed by the domestic electricity market in may 1999 11 before there was competition on domestic markets ofgem set price controls fixing maximum price that the monopoly suppliers could charge domestic customers these price controls remained in place when markets started to get liberalised and were then gradually removed between 2000 and 2002 ofgems decision to remove price controls was based on the assessment that competition was developing well at that time and that the competition act 1998 being effective since march 2000 would deter companies from the abuse of market power and provide ofgem with sufficient power to tackle any abuse moreover consumer surveys showed good awareness of the ability to switch high and rising switching rates away from the former monopoly supplies and substantial and continuing falls in their market shares 12 in 2000 the social action strategy review group was established and the competition act came into force in 2003 the wholesale gas probe was published two years after the removal of the last price controls in april 2004 ofgem published a major review of the state of competition in the domestic energy supply markets concluding that supply competition had delivered substantial benefits for all consumers and that the markets were competitive though not yet mature in 2005 there was the eu energy sector enquiry as well as the supply licence review the energy supply ombudsman was then established in 2006 and in 2008 the energy supply probe was published 13 against the background of unprecedented increases in world fuel prices leading to record increases in wholesale and retail gas and electricity prices so that a typical households energy bills more than doubled since early 2004 ofgem undertook the energy supply probe the numbers of consumers in debt to their energy suppliers average debt levels and disconnection rates were all rising these energy price rises came at a time when household budgets were under pressure from the rising cost of food petrol mortgages and other essentials vulnerable consumers and those in fuel poverty were particularly affected the energy supply probe published the findings on the operation of the uk retail energy markets and set out a package of measures to tackle the issues raised 14 cma investigationedit in june 2014 ofgem announced a competition and markets authority cma investigation into the trading practices and competitiveness of the countrys major energy companies centrica sse plc rwe npower eon scottish power and edf energy the investigation which took two years followed a referral by ofgem to the competition regulator there is near-unanimous support for a referral and the cma investigation offers an important opportunity to clear the air this will help rebuild consumer trust and confidence in the energy market as well as provide the certainty investors have called for ofgem ceo dermot nolan in announcing the investigation 15 in august 2016 ofgem said that it would implement the cmas recommendation that suppliers should be required to provide the details of customers who have been on expensive tariffs for three years or more to rival suppliers ofgem also said that it would impose an interim price cap on customers using pre-payment meters 16 see alsoedit
