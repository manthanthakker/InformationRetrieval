energy development world total primary energy production  note the different y-axis for total left and regional curves right us energy useflow in 2011  energy development 4 5 6 is a field of endeavor focused on making available sufficient primary energy sources 7 and secondary energy forms to meet the needs of society 8 9 10 11 12 these endeavors encompass those which provide for the production of conventional alternative and renewable sources of energy and for the recovery and reuse of energy that would otherwise be wasted energy conservationnote 2 and efficiency measuresnote 3 reduce the effect of energy development and can have benefits to society with changes in economic cost and with changes in the environmental effects contemporary industrial societies use primary and secondary energy sources for transportation and the production of many manufactured goods also large industrial populations have various generation and delivery services for energy distribution and end-user utilizationnote 4 this energy is used by people who can afford the cost to live under various climatic conditions through the use of heating ventilation andor air conditioning level of use of external energy sources differs across societies along with the convenience levels of traffic congestion pollution sources 13 and availability of domestic energy sources thousands of people in society are employed in the energy industry the conventional industry comprises the petroleum industrynote 5 the gas industrynote 6 the electrical power industrynote 7 the coal industry and the nuclear power industry new energy industries include the renewable energy industry comprising alternative and sustainable manufacture distribution and sale of alternative fuels while there is the development of new hydrocarbon sources 14 including deepwaterhorizontal drilling and fracking are continuously underway commitments to mitigate climate change are driving efforts to develop sources of alternative and

sustainability 8.2 resilience 8.3 present and future  types of energyedit colloquially and in non-scientific literature the terms powernote 8 fuels and energy can be used as synonyms but in the field of energy technology they possess different distinct meanings that are associated with them an energy source is usually in the form of a closed system the element that provides the energy by conversion from another energy form however the energy can be quantitative the balance sheet is capable of containing open system energy transfersnote 9 illustrative of this can be the emanations from the sun which with its nuclear fusion is the most important energy source for the earthnote 10 and which provides its energy in the form of radiation the natural elementsnote 11 of the material world exist in forms that can be converted into usable energy and are resources from which society can obtain energy to produce heat light and motion among the many uses according to their nature the power plants can be classified into primary they are found in nature wind water solarnote 12 wood coal oil nuclear secondary are those obtained from primary energy sources electricity gas classified according to the energy reserves of the energy source used and the regeneration capacity with renewable when the energy source used is freely regenerated in a short period and there are practically limitless reserves an example is the solar energy that is the source of energy from the sun or the windnote 13 used as an energy resource renewable energies are original solar natural wind atmospheric flows natural geothermal oceanic tidal natural waterfall hydraulic flows natural plant paper wood natural animal wax greasenote 14 pack animals and sources of mechanical energynote 15 nonrenewable they are coming from energy limited sources on earth in quantity and therefore are exhaustible the non-renewable energy sources include non-exclusively fossil source petroleum natural gas coal original mineralchemical uranium shale gasnote 16 original solar natural wind atmospheric flows natural geothermal oceanic tidal natural waterfall hydraulic flows natural plant paper wood natural animal wax greasenote 14 pack animals and sources of mechanical energynote 15 fossil source petroleum natural gas coal original mineralchemical uranium shale gasnote 16 so for example shale gas is secondary non-renewable wind is a primary renewable the principle stated by antoine lavoisier on the conservation of matter applies to energy developmentnote 17 nothing is created thus any energy production is actually a recovery transformation of the forms of energy whose origin is that of the universe for example a bicycle dynamo turns in part from the kinetic energy speed energy of the movement of the cyclist and converting it into electrical energy will transfer in particular to its lights producing light that is to say light energy via the heating of the filament of the bulb and therefore heat thermal energy but the kinetic energy of the rider is itself biochemical energy the atp muscle cells derived from the chemical energy of sugars synthesized by plants who use light energy from the sun which runs from the nuclear energy produced by fusion of atoms of hydrogen this material itself constitutes a form of energy called mass energy fossil fuelsedit fossil fuel primary non-renewable fossil sources burn coal or hydrocarbon fuels which are the remains of the decomposition of plants and animals there are three main types of fossil fuels coal petroleum and natural gas another fossil fuel liquefied petroleum gas lpg is principally derived from the production of natural gas heat from burning fossil fuel is used either directly for space heating and process heating or converted to mechanical energy for vehicles industrial processes or electrical power generation fossil energy is from recovered fossils like brown coal hard coal peat natural gas and crude oil and are originated in degradated products of dead plants and animals these fossil fuels are based on the carbon cycle and thus allow stored historic solar energy to be recycled today in 2005 81 were of the worlds energy needs met from fossil sources 15 biomass is also derived from wood and other organic wastes and modern remains the technical development of fossil fuels in the 18th and 19th century set the stage for the industrial revolution fossil fuels make up the bulk of the worlds current primary energy sources the technology and infrastructure already exist for the use of fossil fuels petroleum energy density in terms of volume cubic space and mass weight ranks currently above that of alternative energy sources or energy storage devices like a battery fossil fuels are currently economical and suitable for decentralised energy use dependence on fossil fuels from regions or countries creates energy security risks for dependent countries 16 17 18 19 20 oil dependence in particular has led to war 21 funding of radicals 22 monopolization 23 and socio-political instability 24 fossil fuels are non-renewable un-sustainable resources which will eventually decline in production 25 and become exhausted with consequences to societies that remain dependent on them fossil fuels are actually slowly forming continuously but are being consumed quicker than are formednote 18 extracting fuels becomes increasingly extreme as society consumes the most accessible fuel deposits extraction in fuel mines get intensive and oil rigs drill deeper going further out to sea 26 extraction of fossil fuels results in environmental degradation such as the strip mining and mountaintop removal of coal fuel efficiency is a form of thermal efficiency meaning the efficiency of a process that converts chemical potential energy contained in a carrier fuel into kinetic energy or work the fuel economy is the energy efficiency of a particular vehicle is given as a ratio of distance travelled per unit of fuel consumed weight-specific efficiency efficiency per unit weight may be stated for freight and passenger-specific efficiency vehicle efficiency per passenger the inefficient atmospheric combustion burning of fossil fuels in vehicles buildings and power plants contributes to urban heat islands 27 conventional production of oil has peaked conservatively between 2007 and 2010note 19 in 2010 it was estimated that an investment in non-renewable resources of $8 trillion would be required to maintain current levels of production for 25 years 28 in 2010 governments subsidized fossil fuels by an estimated $500 billion a year 29 fossil fuels are also a source of greenhouse gas emissions leading to concerns about global warming if consumption is not reduced the combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of pollution into the atmosphere the fossil fuels are mainly based on organic carbon compounds they are according to the ipcc the causes of the global warming 30 during the combustion with oxygen in the form of heat energy carbon dioxide released depending on the composition and purity of the fossil fuel also results in other chemical compounds such as nitrogen oxides nox and soot and other fine particulates alternativey greenhouse gas emissions result from fossil fuel-based electricity generation a typical coal plant generates billions of kilowatt hours per year 31note 20 emissions from such fossil fuel power station include carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide small particulates nitrogen oxides smog with high levels of ozone carbon monoxide co hydrocarbons volatile organic compounds voc mercury arsenic lead cadmium other heavy metals and traces of uranium 32 33 nuclearedit fissionedit nuclear power or nuclear energy is the use of exothermic nuclear processes 34 to generate useful heat and electricity the term includes nuclear fission nuclear decay and nuclear fusion presently the nuclear fission of elements in the actinide series of the periodic table produce the vast majority of nuclear energy in the direct service of humankind with nuclear decay processes primarily in the form of geothermal energy and radioisotope thermoelectric generators in niche uses making up the rest nuclear fission power stations excluding the contribution from naval nuclear fission reactors provided about 5.7 of the worlds energy and 13 of the worlds electricity in 2012 35 in 2013 the iaea report that there are 437operational nuclear power reactors 36 in 31countries 37 although not every reactor is producing electricity 38 in addition there are approximately 140 naval vessels using nuclear propulsion in operation powered by some 180 reactors 39 40 41 as of 2013 attaining a net energy gain from sustained nuclear fusion reactions excluding natural fusion power sources such as the sun remains an ongoing area of international physics and engineering research more than 60 years after the first attempts commercial fusion power production remains unlikely before 2050 42 there is an ongoing debate about nuclear power 43 44 45 proponents such as the world nuclear association the iaea and environmentalists for nuclear energy contend that nuclear power is a safe sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions 46 opponents such as greenpeace international and nirs contend that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment 47 48 49 nuclear power plant accidents include the chernobyl disaster  1986 fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster  2011 and the three mile island accident  1979 50 there have also been some nuclear submarine accidents 50 51 52 in terms of lives lost per unit of energy generated analysis has determined that nuclear power has caused less fatalities per unit of energy generated than the other major sources of energy generation energy production from coal petroleum natural gas and hydropower has caused a greater number of fatalities per unit of energy generated due to air pollution and energy accident effects 53 54 55 56 57 however the economic costs of nuclear power accidents is high and meltdowns can take decades to clean up the human costs of evacuations of affected populations and lost livelihoods is also significant 58 59 in 2016 strengthening the case of nuclear fission being regarded as a renewable energy the global effort focused on techniques to economically extract the naturally replenishing uranium found in seawater took a step forward and will prevent peak uranium as the quantity of uranium now becoming economically recoverable with the field tested absorbent polymer ropes is practically inexhaustible 60 61 along with other sustainable energy sources nuclear power is a low carbon power generation method of producing electricity with an analysis of the literature on its total life cycle emission intensity finding that it is similar to other renewable sources in a comparison of greenhouse gasghg emissions per unit of energy generated 62 with this translating into from the beginning of nuclear power station commercialization in the 1970s having prevented the emission of approximately 64 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalentgtco2-eq greenhouse gases gases that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of oil coal or natural gas in fossil-fuel power stations 63 as of 2012 according to the iaea worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries 36 approximately 28 of which in the peoples republic of china prc with the most recent nuclear power reactor as of may 2013 to be connected to the electrical grid occurring on february 17 2013 in hongyanhe nuclear power plant in the prc 64 in the united states two new generation iii reactors are under construction at vogtle us nuclear industry officials expect five new reactors to enter service by 2020 all at existing plants 65 in 2013 four aging uncompetitive reactors were permanently closed 66 67 japans 2011 fukushima daiichi nuclear accident which occurred in a reactor design from the 1960s prompted a rethink of nuclear safety and nuclear energy policy in many countries 68 germany decided to close all its reactors by 2022 and italy has banned nuclear power 68 following fukushima in 2011 the international energy agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035 69 70 fission economicsedit the economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject since there are diverging views on this topic and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant but low direct fuel costs in recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult which affects large projects such as nuclear reactors with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks 73 in eastern europe a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance notably belene in bulgaria and the additional reactors at cernavoda in romania and some potential backers have pulled out 73 where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects 73 analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties to date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by state-owned or regulated utility monopolies 75 76 where many of the risks associated with construction costs operating performance fuel price and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers many countries have now liberalized the electricity market where these risks and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants 77 two of the four eprs under construction in finland and france are significantly behind schedule and substantially over cost 78 following the 2011 fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats 79 while first of their kind designs such as the eprs under construction are behind schedule and over-budget of the seven south korean apr-1400s presently under construction worldwide two are in skorea at the hanul nuclear power plant and four are at the largest nuclear station construction project in the world as of 2016 in the united arab emirates at the planned barakah nuclear power plant the first reactor barakah-1 is 85 completed and on schedule for grid-connection during 2017 80 81 renewable sourcesedit renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale such as sunlight wind rain tides waves and geothermal heat 82 renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four distinct areas electricity generation hot waterspace heating motor fuels and rural off-grid energy services 83 about 16 of global final energy consumption presently comes from renewable resources with 10  84 of all energy from traditional biomass mainly used for heating and 3.4 from hydroelectricity new renewables small hydro modern biomass wind solar geothermal and biofuels account for another 3 and are growing rapidly 85 at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 of energy supply national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond 86 wind power for example is growing at the rate of 30 annually with a worldwide installed capacity of 282,482 megawatts mw at the end of 2012 renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security climate change mitigation and economic benefits 87 in international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power 88 while many renewable energy projects are large-scale renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries where energy is often crucial in human development 89 united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity 90 hydroelectricityedit hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by hydropower the production of electrical power through the use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water in 2015 hydropower generated 16.6 of the worlds total electricity and 70 of all renewable electricity 91 and is expected to increase about 3.1 each year for the next 25 years hydropower is produced in 150 countries with the asia-pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010 china is the largest hydroelectricity producer with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010 representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use there are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 gw the three gorges dam in china itaipu dam across the brazilparaguay border and guri dam in venezuela 92 the cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low making it a competitive source of renewable electricity the average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 us cents per kilowatt-hour 92 hydro is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands however damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife 92 once a hydroelectric complex is constructed the project produces no direct waste and has a considerably lower output level of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide co2 than fossil fuel powered energy plants 93 windedit wind primary renewable natural power harnesses the power of the wind to propel the blades of wind turbines these turbines cause the rotation of magnets which creates electricity wind towers are usually built together on wind farms there are offshore and onshore wind farms global wind power capacity has expanded rapidly to 336 gw in june 2014 and wind energy production was around 4 of total worldwide electricity usage and growing rapidly 94 wind power is widely used in europe asia and the united states 95 several countries have achieved relatively high levels of wind power penetration such as 21 of stationary electricity production in denmark 96 18 in portugal 96 16 in spain 96 14 in ireland 97 and 9 in germany in 2010 96 98 by 2011 at times over 50 of electricity in germany and spain came from wind and solar power 99 100 as of 2011 83 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis 98 many of the worlds largest onshore wind farms are located in the united states china and india most of the worlds largest offshore wind farms are located in denmark germany and the united kingdom the two largest offshore wind farm are currently the 630 mw london array and gwynt y môr solaredit solar energy radiant light and heat from the sun is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating solar photovoltaics solar thermal electricity solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis 108 109 solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture convert and distribute solar energy active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the sun selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties and designing spaces that naturally circulate air in 2011 the international energy agency said that the development of affordable inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits it will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource enhance sustainability reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating climate change and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise these advantages are global hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared 108 photovoltaics pv is a method of generating electrical power by converting solar radiation into direct current electricity using semiconductors that exhibit the photovoltaic effect photovoltaic power generation employs solar panels composed of a number of solar cells containing a photovoltaic material materials presently used for photovoltaics include monocrystalline silicon polycrystalline silicon amorphous silicon cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium selenidesulfide due to the increased demand for renewable energy sources the manufacturing of solar cells and photovoltaic arrays has advanced considerably in recent years solar photovoltaics is a sustainable energy source 110 by the end of 2011 a total of 71.1 gw 111 had been installed sufficient to generate 85 twhyear 112 and by end of 2012 the 100 gw installed capacity milestone was achieved 113 solar photovoltaics is now after hydro and wind power the third most important renewable energy source in terms of globally installed capacity more than 100 countries use solar pv installations may be ground-mounted and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing or built into the roof or walls of a building either building-integrated photovoltaics or simply rooftop driven by advances in technology and increases in manufacturing scale and sophistication the cost of photovoltaics has declined steadily since the first solar cells were manufactured 114 and the levelised cost of electricity lcoe from pv is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions net metering and financial incentives such as preferential feed-in tariffs for solar-generated electricity have supported solar pv installations in many countries 115 the energy payback time epbt also known as energy amortization depends on the locations annual solar insolation and temperature profile as well as on the used type of pv-technology for conventional crystalline silicon photovoltaics the epbt is higher than for thin-film technologies such as cdte-pv or cpv-systems moreover the payback time decreased in the recent years due to a number of improvements such as solar cell efficiency and more economic manufacturing processes as of 2014 photovoltaics recoup on average the energy needed to manufacture them in 0.7 to 2 years this results in about 95 of net-clean energy produced by a solar rooftop pv system over a 30-year life-time 116:30 biofuelsedit a biofuel is a fuel that contains energy from geologically recent carbon fixation these fuels are produced from living organisms examples of this carbon fixation occur in plants and microalgae these fuels are made by a biomass conversion biomass refers to recently living organisms most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials this biomass can be converted to convenient energy containing substances in three different ways thermal conversion chemical conversion and biochemical conversion this biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid liquid or gas form this new biomass can be used for biofuels biofuels have increased in popularity because of rising oil prices and the need for energy security bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn or sugarcane cellulosic biomass derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions bioethanol is widely used in the usa and in brazil current plant design does not provide for converting the lignin portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation biodiesel is made from vegetable oils and animal fats biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in europe however research is underway on producing renewable fuels from decarboxylation 117 in 2010 worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters  28 billion gallons us up 17 from 2009 118 and biofuels provided 2.7 of the worlds fuels for road transport a contribution largely made up of ethanol and biodieselcitation needed global ethanol fuel production reached 86 billion liters  23 billion gallons us in 2010 with the united states and brazil as the worlds top producers accounting together for 90 of global production the worlds largest biodiesel producer is the european union accounting for 53 of all biodiesel production in 2010 118 as of 2011 mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states or provinces 98 the international energy agency has a goal for biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050 to reduce dependence on petroleum and coal 119 geothermaledit geothermal energy is thermal energy generated and stored in the earth thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter the geothermal energy of the earths crust originates from the original formation of the planet  20 and from radioactive decay of minerals  80 120 the geothermal gradient which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface the adjective geothermal originates from the greek roots γη ge meaning earth and θερμος thermos meaning hot earths internal heat is thermal energy generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from earths formation temperatures at the core-mantle boundary may reach over 4000c  7,200f 121 the high temperature and pressure in earths interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically resulting in portions of mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock rock and water is heated in the crust sometimes up to 370c  700f 122 from hot springs geothermal energy has been used for bathing since paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient roman times but it is now better known for electricity generation worldwide 11,400 megawatts mw of geothermal power is online in 24 countries in 2012 123 an additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district heating space heating spas industrial processes desalination and agricultural applications in 2010 124 geothermal power is cost effective reliable sustainable and environmentally friendly 125 but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources especially for applications such as home heating opening a potential for widespread exploitation geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels as a result geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels the earths geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanitys energy needs but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology energy prices subsidies and interest rates pilot programs like ewebs customer opt in green power program  126 show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal but as a result of government assisted research and industry experience the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25 over the past two decades 127 in 2001 geothermal energy cost between two and ten us cents per kwh 128 oceanicedit marine energy or marine power also sometimes referred to as ocean energy ocean power or marine and hydrokinetic energy refers to the energy carried by ocean waves tides salinity and ocean temperature differences the movement of water in the worlds oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy or energy in motion this energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes transport and industries the term marine energy encompasses both wave power ie power from surface waves and tidal power ie obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy as wind power is derived from the wind even if the wind turbines are placed over water the oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world 100 renewable energyedit the incentive to use 100 renewable energy for electricity transport or even total primary energy supply globally has been motivated by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns renewable energy use has grown much faster than anyone anticipated 129 the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand 130 at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 of energy supply also professors s pacala and robert h socolow have developed a series of stabilization wedges that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change and renewable energy sources in aggregate constitute the largest number of their wedges  131 mark z jacobson says producing all new energy with wind power solar power and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050 barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be primarily social and political not technological or economic jacobson says that energy costs with a wind solar water system should be similar to todays energy costs 132 similarly in the united states the independent national research council has noted that sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change energy security and the escalation of energy costs  renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the united states taken collectively can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand  133 critics of the "100 renewable energy approach include vaclav smil and james e hansen smil and hansen are concerned about the variable output of solar and wind power but amory lovins argues that the electricity grid can cope 134 increased energy efficiencyedit although increasing the efficiency of energy use is not energy development per se it may be considered under the topic of energy development since it makes existing energy sources available to do work 136:22 efficient energy use simply called energy efficiency is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services for example insulating a home allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature installing fluorescent lamps or natural skylights reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional incandescent light bulbs compact fluorescent lights use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights improvements in energy efficiency are most often achieved by adopting an efficient technology or production process 137 there are various motivations to improve energy efficiency reducing energy use reduces energy costs and may result in a financial cost saving to consumers if the energy savings offset any additional costs of implementing an energy efficient technology reducing energy use is also seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing emissions according to the international energy agency improved energy efficiency in buildings industrial processes and transportation could reduce the worlds energy needs in 2050 by one third and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases 138 energy efficiency and renewable energy are said to be the twin pillars of sustainable energy policy 139 in many countries energy efficiency is also seen to have a national security benefit because it can be used to reduce the level of energy imports from foreign countries and may slow down the rate at which domestic energy resources are depleted transmissionedit while new sources of energy are only rarely discovered or made possible by new technology distribution technology continually evolves 140 the use of fuel cells in cars for example is an anticipated delivery technology 141 this section presents the various delivery technologies that have been important to historic energy development they all rely in way on the energy sources listed in the previous section shipping and pipelinesedit shipping is a flexible delivery technology that is used in the whole range of energy development regimes from primitive to highly advanced currently coal petroleum and their derivatives are delivered by shipping via boat rail or road petroleum and natural gas may also be delivered via pipeline and coal via a slurry pipeline refined hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline and lpg may also be delivered via aircraft natural gas pipelines must maintain a certain minimum pressure to function correctly ethanols corrosive properties make it harder to build ethanol pipelines the higher costs of ethanol transportation and storage are often prohibitive 142 geomagnetically induced currents seen as interfering with the normal operation of long buried pipeline systems are a manifestation 143 144 at ground level of space weather that occur due to time-varying ionospheric source fields and the conductivity of the earth wired energy transferedit electricity grids are the networks used to transmit and distribute power from production source to end user when the two may be hundreds of kilometres away sources include electrical generation plants such as a nuclear reactor coal burning power plant etc a combination of sub-stations transformers towers cables and piping are used to maintain a constant flow of electricity grids may suffer from transient blackouts and brownouts often due to weather damage during certain extreme space weather events solar wind can interfere with transmissions grids also have a predefined carrying capacity or load that cannot safely be exceeded when power requirements exceed whats available failures are inevitable to prevent problems power is then rationed industrialised countries such as canada the us and australia are among the highest per capita consumers of electricity in the world which is possible thanks to a widespread electrical distribution network the us grid is one of the most advanced although infrastructure maintenance is becoming a problem currentenergy provides a realtime overview of the electricity supply and demand for california texas and the northeast of the us african countries with small scale electrical grids have a correspondingly low annual per capita usage of electricity one of the most powerful power grids in the world supplies power to the state of queensland australia wireless energy transferedit wireless energy transfer is a process whereby electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to an electrical load that does not have a built-in power source without the use of interconnecting wires storageedit energy storage is accomplished by devices or physical media that store energy to perform useful operation at a later time a device that stores energy is sometimes called an accumulator all forms of energy are either potential energy eg chemical gravitational electrical energy temperature differential latent heat etc or kinetic energy eg momentum some technologies provide only short-term energy storage and others can be very long-term such as power to gas using hydrogen or methane and the storage of heat or cold between opposing seasons in deep aquifers or bedrock a wind-up clock stores potential energy in this case mechanical in the spring tension a battery stores readily convertible chemical energy to operate a mobile phone and a hydroelectric dam stores energy in a reservoir as gravitational potential energy ice storage tanks store ice thermal energy in the form of latent heat at night to meet peak demand for cooling fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels even food which is made by the same process as fossil fuels is a form of energy stored in chemical form history of energy developmentedit since prehistory when humanity discovered fire to warm up and roast food through the middle ages in which populations built windmills to grind the wheat until the modern era in which nations can get electricity splitting the atom man has sought endlessly for energy sourcesnote 21 from which to draw profit which have been the fossil fuels on one hand the coal to fuel the steam engines run industrial rails as well as maintain households and secondly the oil and its derivatives in the industry and transportation primarily automotive although have lived with smaller-scale exploitation of wind power hydro and biomass this model of development however is based on the depletion of fossil resources from periods of millions years without possibility for replacement as would be required to maintain the search for energy sources that are inexhaustible and utilization by industrialized countries to strengthen their national economies by reducing its dependence on fossil fuelsnote 22 has led to the adoption of nuclear energy and those with sufficient water resources the intensive hydraulic use of their waterways since the beginning of the industrial revolution the question of the future of energy supplies has been of interest in 1865 william stanley jevons published the coal question in which he saw that the reserves of coal were being depleted and that oil was an ineffective replacement in 1914 us bureau of mines stated that the total production was 5.7 billion barrels  910,000,000m3 in 1956 geophysicist m king hubbert deduces that us oil production will peak between 1965 and 1970 peaked in 1971 and that oil production will peak within half a century on the basis of 1956 datanote 23 in 1989 predicted peak by colin campbell 145 in 2004 opec estimated with substantial investments it would nearly double oil output by 2025 146 sustainabilityedit the environmental movement has emphasized sustainability of energy use and development 147 renewable energy is sustainable in its production the available supply will not be diminished for the foreseeable future - millions or billions of years sustainability also refers to the ability of the environment to cope with waste products especially air pollution sources which have no direct waste products such as wind solar and hydropower are brought up on this point with global demand for energy growing the need to adopt various energy sources is growing energy conservation is an alternative or complementary process to energy development it reduces the demand for energy by using it efficiently resilienceedit some observers contend that idea of energy independence is an unrealisticnote 24 and opaque concept 148 the alternative offer of energy resilience is a goal aligned with economic security and energy realities the notion of resilience in energy was detailed in the 1982 book brittle power energy strategy for national security 149 the authors argued that simply switching to domestic energy would not be secure inherently because the true weakness is the interdependent and vulnerable energy infrastructure of the united states key aspects such as gas lines and the electrical power grid are centralized and easily susceptible to disruption they conclude that a resilient energy supply is necessary for both national security and the environment they recommend a focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy that is decentralized 150 in 2008 former intel corporation chairman and ceo andrew grove looked to energy resilience arguing that complete independence is unfeasible given the global market for energy 151 he describes energy resilience as the ability to adjust to interruptions in the supply of energy to that end he suggests the us make greater use of electricity 152 electricity can be produced from a variety of sources a diverse energy supply will be less affected by the disruption in supply of any one source he reasons that another feature of electrification is that electricity is sticky  meaning the electricity produced in the us is to stay there because it cannot be transported overseas according to grove a key aspect of advancing electrification and energy resilience will be converting the us automotive fleet from gasoline-powered to electric-powered this in turn will require the modernization and expansion of the electrical power grid as organizations such as the reform institute have pointed out advancements associated with the developing smart grid would facilitate the ability of the grid to absorb vehicles en masse connecting to it to charge their batteries 153 present and futureedit extrapolations from current knowledge to the future offer a choice of energy futures 156 predictions parallel the malthusian catastrophe hypothesis numerous are complex models based scenarios as pioneered by limits to growth modeling approaches offer ways to analyze diverse strategies and hopefully find a road to rapid and sustainable development of humanity short term energy crises are also a concern of energy development extrapolations lack plausibility particularly when they predict a continual increase in oil consumptioncitation needed energy production usually requires an energy investment drilling for oil or building a wind power plant requires energy the fossil fuel resources see above that are left are often increasingly difficult to extract and convert they may thus require increasingly higher energy investments if investment is greater than the energy produced by the resource it is no longer an effective energy source 157note 25 this means that resources the wasteful ones are not used effectively for energy productionnote 26 such resources can be exploited economically in order to produce raw materialsnote 27 they then become ordinary mining reserves economically recoverable are not a positive energy sources new technology may ameliorate this problem if it can lower the energy investment required to extract and convert the resources although ultimately basic physics sets limits that cannot be exceeded between 1950 and 1984 as the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe world grain production increased by 250 the energy for the green revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers natural gas pesticides oil and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation 158 the peaking of world hydrocarbon production peak oil may lead to significant changes and require sustainable methods of production 159 one vision of a sustainable energy future involves all human structures on the earths surface ie buildings vehicles and roads doing artificial photosynthesis using sunlight to split water as a source of hydrogen and absorbing carbon dioxide to make fertilizer efficiently than plants 160 with contemporary space industrys economic activity 161 162 and the related private spaceflight with the manufacturing industries that go into earths orbit or beyond delivering them to those regions will require further energy development 163 164 165 166 commercialization of space includes satellite navigation systems satellite television and satellite radio investments estimated to be $50.8 billion 167 researchers have contemplated space-based solar power for collecting solar power in space for use on earthnote 28note 29 space-based solar power only differ from solar and other similar radiant energy collection methods in that the means used to collect energy would reside on an orbiting satellite instead of on earths surface some projected benefits of such a system are a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing and refracting atmosphere and nighttime in spacenote 30 see alsoedit energy portal renewable energy portal nuclear technology portal
