geothermal power in indonesia geothermal power in indonesia is an increasingly significant source of renewable energy as a result of its volcanic geology it is often reported that indonesia has 40 of the worlds potential geothermal resources estimated at 28,000 megawatts mw 1 currently indonesia is the worlds third largest geothermal electricity producer after the united states and the philippines installed production capacity  2011 is almost 1,200mw from six geothermal fields in java north sumatra and north sulawesi 2 in 2007 geothermal energy represented 1.9 of the countrys total energy supply and 3.7 of its electric power 3 at the 2010 world geothermal congress in bali president susilo bambang yudhoyono announced a plan to build 44 new geothermal plants by 2014 more than tripling capacity to 4,000mw by 2025 indonesia aims to produce more than 9,000mw of geothermal power becoming the worlds leading geothermal energy producer 1 this would account for 5 of indonesias total energy needs 3 a detailed report on the geothermal sector in indonesia issued in 2015 by the asian development bank and world bank unlocking indonesias geothermal potential indicated that reforms in key areas of policy were likely to be needed to stimulate sustained expansion in the sector  contents 1 history 2 exploration and development 3 installed capacity 4 recent developments 5 policy issues 6

in javas kawah kamojang field the third being the first that was successful 4 in the early 1980s it was still discharging superheated steam from a depth of 66 metres at a temperature of 140c and a pressure of 3.5 to 4 bars a prefeasibility study for electricity generation was initiated in 1972 by geothermal energy new zealand 5 the first generator was inaugurated in 1983 by president suharto and subsequently expanded in 1987 current capacity is 140mw 6 since the mid-1980s chevron the worlds largest geothermal power producer has operated two geothermal fields in west java at salak and darajat 2 with a combined capacity of around 365mw 7 between 1989 and 1997 explorations were conducted at the sibayak geothermal field in northern sumatra 8 and subsequently a 12mw plant has been placed in operation 9 in 1991 the indonesia geothermal association asosiasi panasbumi indonesia - api a non-governmental organisation was established to promote geothermal energy it has approximately 500 members including geothermal experts companies and stakeholders 3 the wayang windu geothermal power station in west java owned by british star energy has been in operation since 2000 it currently comprises two units with a total capacity of 227mw there are plans for a third unit of 127mw which is expected to be on-stream by mid-2013 10 exploration and developmentedit exploration of the bedugul geothermal field in bali started in 1974 11 and though production capacity was estimated at 175mw in 2008 the project is on hold after being opposed by local residents 12 at the 2010 world geothermal congress in bali several companies were awarded the rights to develop geothermal fields and power plants golden spike indonesia won the tender to develop a power plant at mount ungaran in central java sokoria geothermal indonesia gained rights to develop a plant at ende on flores island while supreme energy was chosen to develop plants at mount rajabasa in lampung and solok in west sumatra these projects were estimated to require a total investment of us$1.68 billion 13 as of 2010 a total of 265 potential sites for plants have been identified across the country 1 development of the industry however involves a range of complex policy issues some of which are proving to be a continuing source of controversy 14 in mid-2011 for example the indonesian government issued an expected regulation providing certain guarantees for investors with the aim of encouraging increased investment in the geothermal sector however investor response was guarded suggesting that key aspects had not been addressed in the regulation 15 in late 2013 pt pertamina geothermal energy pge -- a geothermal business branch of state oil and gas company pt pertaminasaid that it planned to develop eight new geothermal plants with a total capacity of 655mw expected to require $2.0 bn of new investments these included 110 mw at ulubelu in lampung province 110 mw at lumut balai in south sumatra 40 mw at lahendong 30 mw at karaha 35 mw at kamojang 110 mw at hululais 110 mw at sungai penuh of these several were to be financed with loans from world bank and japan international cooperation agency 16 in addition work is starting on the sarulla geothermal plant in north sumatra with a total planned capacity of 320 mw the plant has been on the books since the early 1990s but development was stalled over various issues the plant expected to cost around $1.65 billion will be built with financial support from the asian development bank along with the japan bank for international cooperation and other lenders 17 installed capacityedit according to the renewable energy policy networks renewables 2013 global status report indonesia has the third largest installed generating capacity in the world in the geothermal sector with 1.3 gw installed capacity indonesia trails only the united states  3.4 gw and the philippines  1.9 gw however it leads mexico  1.0 gw italy  0.9 gw new zealand  0.8 gw iceland  0.7 gw and japan  0.5 gw 18 recent developmentsedit in recent years the indonesian government has announced plans for two fast-track increases in the total capacity of indonesias electricity generation network of 10,000mw each under the second 10,000mw fast-track plan it was forecast that a relatively large share of 3,970mw would be installed in geothermal plants but under the first 10,000mw fast-track plan investment in the geothermal sector appears to be lagging september 2011 the indonesian state-owned electricity utility perusahaan listrik negara pln announced that the outlook was that by 2014 only 1,200mw of power was likely to be produced from geothermal plants the then-president director of the pln dahlan iskan said that plans to develop a number of geothermal plants were behind schedule because private sector investors were reluctant to invest as a result of the perceived risks in the sector 19 july 2012 a senior official from the pln reported that there were 13 geothermal power plants that were still stuck in the exploration stages and were likely to miss development deadlines problems mentioned included disappointing results at drilling sites lack of adequate supporting infrastructure mainly roads and difficulties that firms faced in obtaining required permits for their activities from the forestry department and local governments 20 june 2013 the first international geothermal conference and exhibition was held in indonesia the relatively slow development of the sector attracted comment the minister for energy and mineral resources announced that the prices to be paid for energy supplied by geothermal suppliers would be increased to encourage activity in the sector speaking at the conference the indonesian vice president boediono called for changes in policy to speed up development 21 june 2013 work on a significant geothermal project in lampung in south sumatra planned size 220mw was suspended following local protests local villagers in the mount rajabasa area claimed that development of the project would damage the social structure of the community the forestry minister zulkifli hasan sided with the local community saying that the company developing the site pt supreme energy would need to convince the local villagers of the safety of the project in response the chair of the indonesian geothermal association said that the government should shut all geothermal projects if top officials were half-hearted in their commitment to investors 22 august 2014 the indonesian parliament approved a new geothermal law aimed at facilitating development in the sector key points of the new law included the following a geothermal activities would no longer be considered mining activities development of geothermal resources can be carried out in forest conservation areas under the existing forestry law mining operations are prohibited in protected forests b tenders for geothermal projects will be called by the central government instead of by local administrations c new geothermal projects will be developed under new more favorable pricing arrangements d local administrations will receive a portion of the revenues derived from geothermal resources e quite detailed provisions were set out regarding such things as surveys of geothermal sites exploration tendering procedures the size of working areas arrangements for determining prices and administrative sanctions obligations of the holders of geothermal licenses and so on 23 policy issuesedit expansion in the sector appears to be being held back by a range of factors including an uncertain regulatory environment including especially uncertainty over land laws and the perceived risks of development 24 the indonesian governments plans for development of the geothermal sector rely largely on private sector investment 25 but numerous reports indicate that private sector investors are concerned about a range of risks including technical geological risks regulatory risks stemming from uncertain government policy and financial risks arising from the pricing policies determined by the indonesian government 26 there is disagreement within the indonesian government as to who should bear these risks policy makers in the power sector with an eye to meeting the governments official investment targets are often inclined to the view that at least some of the risks should be borne by the indonesian government through the national budget managed by the ministry of finance 27 official policy from the ministry of finance has traditionally been cautious resisting the suggestion that unspecified risks should be borne by the indonesian budget in response to reports about certain of the risks that private sector investors were concerned about in mid-2011 the government issued a regulation intended to provide guarantees that the state electricity utility pln would meet financial obligations to independent power producers ipps who invested in the geothermal sector but the regulation was quickly criticised by representatives of private investors as being too limited and for failing to clarify important concerns 28 pricing policy prices have been another important policy issue in the sector in an effort to encourage private sector investment the indonesian government has been establishing a feed-in tariff scheme by instructing state electricity utility pln to purchase power from geothermal projects at various rates ranging from around 6.5 us cents to over 12 us cents per kwh 29 the government is also preparing a regulation that is expected to specify the price that the pln must purchase power from geothermal plans in the second 10,000mw fast-track electricity sector program which the government has announced this regulation is expected to be finalised by early 2012 30 environmental issuesedit according to the ministry of forestry around 80 of geothermal reserves are located in designated conserved forest areas the 2009 mineral and coal mining law lists geothermal exploration as a mining activity so a presidential decree would be required to allow geothermal activities conserved forest areas according to the ministry geothermal mining is unlikely to cause environmental harm 31 in may 2011 the indonesian government imposed a two-year moratorium on logging however this excepts the energy sector including geothermal activities 32 see alsoedit renewable energy portal indonesia portal list of power stations in indonesia list of geothermal power stations list of
