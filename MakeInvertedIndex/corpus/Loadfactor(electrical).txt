load factor electrical in electrical engineering the load factor is defined as the average load divided by the peak load in a specified time period 1 f l o a d  average load maximum load in given time period displaystyle floadfrac textaverage loadtextmaximum load in given time period typical example of a large commercial electrical bill kw demand  436 kw kwh use  57,200 kwh number of days in billing cycle  30d load factor    57,200 kwh   30 days x 24 hours per day x 436 kw x 100  18.22 it can be derived from the load profile of the specific device or system of devices its value is always less than one because maximum demand is always higher than average demand since facilities likely never operate at full capacity for the duration of an entire 24-hour day a high load factor means power usage is relatively constant low load factor shows that occasionally a high demand is set to service that peak capacity is sitting idle for long periods thereby imposing higher costs on the system electrical rates are designed so that customers with high load factor are charged less overall per kwh this process along with others is called load balancing or peak shaving the load factor is closely related to and often confused with the demand factor f d e m a n d  maximum load in given time period maximum possible load displaystyle fdemandfrac textmaximum load in given time periodtextmaximum possible load the major difference to note is that the denominator in the demand factor is fixed depending on the system because of this the demand factor cannot be derived from the load profile but needs the addition of the full load of the system in question see alsoedit energy portal availability factor capacity factor demand factor diversity factor utilization factor referencesedit v t e availability factor base load black start capacity factor demand factor demand management eroei fault grid storage intermittency load factor load following nameplate capacity peak demand power quality power-flow study repowering variability coal fossil-fuel power station natural gas petroleum nuclear oil shale biomass biofuel geothermal hydro marine current osmotic thermal tidal wave solar wind current osmotic thermal tidal wave ac power cogeneration combined cycle cooling tower induction generator micro chp microgeneration rankine cycle three-phase electric power virtual power plant blackout rolling blackout brownout demand response distributed generation dynamic demand electric power distribution electric power system electric power transmission electrical grid high-voltage direct current load management pumped hydro power station power storage smart grid substation super grid transformer transmission system operator tso transmission tower utility pole arc-faultcircuitinterrupter earth leakage circuit breaker residual-current device gfi power-system protection protective relay digital protective relay sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker carbon offset cost of electricity by source ecotax energy subsidies feed-in tariff fossil-fuel phase-out net metering pigovian tax renewable energy certificates renewable energy payments renewable energy policy spark spread
