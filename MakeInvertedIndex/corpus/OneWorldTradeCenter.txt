one world trade center 1 wtc freedom tower pre-2009 1 office observation communication david childsb daniel libeskind  2002 8 one world trade center also known as the freedom tower 12 1 world trade center one wtc and 1 wtc is the main building of the rebuilt world trade center complex in lower manhattan new york city it is the tallest building in the western hemisphere and the sixth-tallest in the world the supertall structure has the same name as the north tower of the original world trade center which was completely destroyed in the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the new skyscraper stands on the northwest corner of the 16-acre  6.5ha world trade center site on the site of the original 6 world trade center the building is bounded by west street to the west vesey street to the north fulton street to the south and washington street to the east the buildings architect was david childs whose firm skidmore owings  merrill som also designed the burj khalifa and the willis tower the construction of below-ground utility relocations footings and foundations for the new building began on april 27 2006 one world trade center became the tallest structure in new york city on april 30 2012 when it surpassed the height of the empire state building the towers steel structure was topped out on august 30 2012 on may 10 2013 the final component of the skyscrapers spire was installed making the building including its spire reach a total height of 1,776 feet  541m its height in feet is a deliberate reference to the year when the united states declaration of independence was signed the building opened on november 3 2014 on march 30 2009 the port authority of new york and new jersey panynj confirmed that the building would be officially known by its legal name of one world trade center rather than its colloquial name of freedom tower the building is 104 standard floors high but the tower has only 94 actual stories the new world trade center complex will eventually include five high-rise office buildings built along greenwich street as well as the national september 11 memorial  museum located just south of one world trade center where the original twin towers stood the construction of the new building is part of an effort to memorialize and rebuild following the destruction of the original world trade center complex contents 1 original building  1970–2001

authority construction workers original building  1970–2001 construction the construction of the world trade center of which the twin towers one and two world trade center were the centerpieces was conceived as an urban renewal project and spearheaded by david rockefeller the project was intended to help revitalize lower manhattan 13 the project was planned by the port authority of new york and new jersey which hired architect minoru yamasaki yamasaki came up with the idea of building twin towers after extensive negotiations the new jersey and new york state governments which supervise the port authority consented to the construction of the world trade center at the radio row site located in the lower-west area of manhattan 14 to satisfy the new jersey government the port authority agreed to buy the bankrupt hudson  manhattan railroad renamed to port authority trans-hudson which transported commuters from new jersey to lower manhattan 15 the towers were designed as framed tube structures giving tenants open floor plans unobstructed by columns or walls 16 17 this design was accomplished by using many closely spaced perimeter columns providing much of the structures strength with the gravity load shared with the core columns the elevator system which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators allowed substantial floor space to be used for office purposes by making the structural core smaller the design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation 18 19 construction of the north tower one world trade center began in august 1966 extensive use of prefabricated components sped up the construction process the first tenants moved into the north tower in december 1970 20 21 in the 1970s four other low-level buildings were built as part of the world trade center complex 22 23 a seventh building was built in the mid-1980s 24 25 specifications and operations after seven world trade center was built in the 1980s the world trade center complex had a total of seven buildings however the most notable ones were the main twin towers built in the 1970sone world trade center was the north tower and two world trade center was the south tower 26 each tower was over 1,350 feet  410m high and occupied about 1 acre  0.40ha of the total 16 acres  6.5ha of the sites land during a press conference in 1973 yamasaki was asked why two 110-story buildings why not one 220-story building his response was i didnt want to lose the human scale 27 when completed in 1972 one world trade center became the tallest building in the world for two years surpassing the empire state building which had held the record for 40 years the north tower was 1,368 feet  417m tall and in 1978 a telecommunications antenna was added to the top of the roof by itself the antenna was 360 feet  110m tall with the 360-foot  110m-tall antenna the highest point of the north tower reached 1,728ft  527m 28 the tower held its record for a brief period of time chicagos sears tower finished in may 1973 was 1,450 feet  440m at the rooftop 29 at 110 floors the world trade center towers had more floors than any other building at that time 28 this number was not surpassed until the construction of the burj khalifa  163 floors which opened in 2010 30 31 of the 110 stories eight were set aside as mechanical floors floors 7/8 41/42 75/76 and 108/109 which were four two-floor areas that were spaced up the building in even intervals all the remaining floors were open for tenants each floor of the tower had 40,000 square feet  3,700m2 of available space 32 the north and south tower had 3,800,000 square feet  350,000m2 of total office space 32 the entire complex of seven buildings had a combined total of 13,400,000 square feet  1,240,000m2 of office space 22 23 33 the complex initially failed to attract the expected clientele during the early years various governmental organizations became key tenants of the world trade center such as the state of new york in the 1980s the citys perilous financial condition eased after which an increasing number of private companiesmostly financial firms related to wall streetbecame tenants during the 1990s approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex including financial companies such as morgan stanley aon corporation and salomon brothers the basement concourse of the world trade center included the mall at the world trade center 34 and a path station 35 the north tower became the main corporate headquarters of cantor fitzgerald 36 and it also became the headquarters of the port authority of new york and new jersey 37 the towers electrical service was supplied by consolidated edison coned at 13,800volts the electricity passed through the world trade center primary distribution center pdc and was then sent up the buildings core to electrical substations located on the mechanical floors the substations lowered the 13,800 primary voltage to 480/277volts and the voltage was then further lowered to 208/120volts for general power and lighting services the complex was also served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and on the roof of five world trade center 38 39 the 110th floor of one world trade center the north tower housed radio and television transmission equipment the roof of the north tower contained a vast array of transmission antennas including the 360 feet  110m center antenna mast rebuilt by dielectric inc to support dtv in 1999 40 the center mast contained the television signals for almost all nyc television broadcasters wcbs-tv 2 wnbc-tv 4 wnyw 5 wabc-tv 7 wwor-tv 9 secaucus wpix 11 wnet 13 newark wpxn-tv 31 and wnju 47 linden 40 it also had four nyc fm broadcasters wpat-fm 93.1 wnyc 93.9 wkcr 89.9 and wktu 103.5 40 access to the roof was controlled by the wtc operations control center occ located in the b1 level of the south tower 40 after the september 11 attacks of 2001 the broadcasting equipment for the radio and television stations was moved to the empire state building 41 on a typical weekday a combined total of 50,000 people worked in the north and south towers 42 with another 200,000 passing through as visitors 43 the complex was so large that it had its own zip code 10048 44 the windows on the world restaurant located on top of the north tower reported revenues of $37 million in 2000 making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the united states 45 the twin towers became known worldwide appearing in movies television shows postcards and other merchandise the towers came to be seen as a new york city icon much like the empire state building the chrysler building and the statue of liberty 46 incidents on february 13 1975 a three-alarm fire broke out on the 11th floor of the north tower fire spread through the core of the building to the 9th and 14th floors as the insulation for telephone cables located in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors had been ignited areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately and the original fire was put out in a few hours 47 most of the damage was on the 11th floor where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper alcohol-based fluid for office machines and other office equipment fireproofing protected the steel 48 and there was no structural damage to the tower 47 in addition to the fire damage on the 9th and 14th floors water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few floors below at the time the world trade center complex had no fire sprinkler systems 47 the first terrorist attack on the world trade center occurred on february 26 1993 at 12:17pm when a ryder truck filled with 1,500 pounds  680kg of explosives planted by ramzi yousef detonated in the underground garage of the north tower 49 the blast resulted in a 100 feet  30m hole through five sublevels the greatest damage was on levels b1 and b2 with significant structural damage on level b3 50 six people were killed and more than a thousand were injured as 50,000 workers and visitors were inside the tower at the time many people inside the north tower were forced to walk down darkened stairwells that had no emergency lighting and some took two hours or more to reach safety 51 52 september 11 attacks at 8:46am edt on september 11 2001 five hijackers affiliated with al-qaeda crashed american airlines flight 11 into the northern facade of the north tower 53 54 seventeen minutes later at 9:03am edt a second group of terrorists crashed the hijacked united airlines flight 175 into the southern facade of the south tower striking between the 77th and 85th floors 55 by 9:59am edt the south tower collapsed after burning for approximately 56 minutes after burning for 102minutes the north tower collapsed due to structural failure at 10:28am edt 56 when the north tower collapsed debris fell on the nearby 7 world trade center damaging it and starting fires the fires burned for hours compromising the buildings structural integrity seven world trade center collapsed at 5:21pm edt 57 58 together with a simultaneous attack on the pentagon in arlington virginia and a failed plane hijacking that resulted in a plane crash in shanksville pennsylvania the attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people  2,507 civilians 343 firefighters 72 law enforcement officers 55 military personnel and the 19 hijackers 59 60 61 more than 90 of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact 62 in the north tower 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped and died of smoke inhalation fell jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames or were killed when the building eventually collapsed one stairwell in the south tower stairwell a somehow avoided complete destruction unlike the rest of the building 63 when flight 11 hit all three staircases in the north tower above the impact zone were destroyed thus making it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape 107 people below the point of impact also died 62 current building construction in popular culture 2 3 4 5 7 v t e planning and early development following the destruction of the original world trade center there was debate regarding the future of the world trade center site there were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately and by 2002 the lower manhattan development corporation had organized a competition to determine how to use the site 64 the proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the september 11 attacks and rebuild the complex 65 66 when the public rejected the first round of designs a second more open competition took place in december 2002 in which a design by daniel libeskind was selected as the winner this design went through many revisions mainly because of disagreements with developer larry silverstein who held the lease to the world trade center site at that time 67 there was criticism concerning the limited number of floors that were designated for office space and other amenities in an early plan only 82 floors would have been habitable and the total office space of the rebuilt world trade center complex would have been reduced by more than 3,000,000 square feet  280,000m2 in comparison with the original complex 5 the floor limit was imposed by silverstein who expressed concern that higher floors would be a liability in the event of a future terrorist attack or other incident much of the buildings height would have consisted of a large open-air steel lattice structure on the roof of the tower containing wind turbines and sky gardens 5 in a subsequent design the highest occupiable floor became comparable to the original world trade center and the open-air lattice was removed from the plans 5 in 2002 former new york governor george pataki faced accusations of cronyism for supposedly using his influence to get the winning architects design picked as a personal favor for his friend and campaign contributor ron lauder 68 a final design for the freedom tower was formally unveiled on june 28 2005 to address security issues raised by the new york city police department a 187-foot  57m concrete base was added to the design in april of that year the design originally included plans to clad the base in glass prisms in order to address criticism that the building might have looked uninviting and resembled a concrete bunker however the prisms were later found to be unworkable as preliminary testing revealed that the prismatic glass easily shattered into large and dangerous shards as a result it was replaced by a simpler facade consisting of stainless steel panels and blast-resistant glass 69 contrasting with libeskinds original plan the towers final design tapers octagonally as it rises its designers stated that the tower would be a monolithic glass structure reflecting the sky and topped by a sculpted antenna in 2006 larry silverstein commented on a planned completion date by 2012 we should have a completely rebuilt world trade center more magnificent more spectacular than it ever was 70 on april 26 2006 the port authority of new york and new jersey approved a conceptual framework that allowed foundation construction to begin a formal agreement was drafted the following day the 75th anniversary of the 1931 opening of the empire state building construction began in may a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place when the first construction team arrived 71 construction and later development the symbolic cornerstone of one world trade center was laid in a ceremony on july 4 2004 72 the stone had an inscription supposedly written by arthur j finkelstein 73 however construction was delayed until 2006 due to disputes over money security and design 72 the last major issues were resolved on april 26 2006 when a deal was made between developer larry silverstein and the port authority of new york and new jersey so the cornerstone was temporarily removed from the site on june 23 2006 74 soon after explosives were detonated at the construction site for two months to clear bedrock for the buildings foundation onto which 400 cubic yards  310 cubic meters of concrete was poured by november 2007 75 in a december 18 2006 ceremony held in nearby battery park city members of the public were invited to sign the first 30-foot  9.1m steel beam installed onto the buildings base 76 77 it was welded onto the buildings base on december 19 2006 78 foundation and steel installation began shortly afterward so the towers footings and foundation were nearly complete within a year 79 in january 2008 two cranes were moved onto the site construction of the towers concrete core which began after the cranes arrived 79 reached street level by may 17 however construction of the base was not finished until two years later after which construction of the office floors began and the first glass windows were subsequently installed during 2010 floors were constructed at a rate of about one per week 80 an advanced cocoon scaffolding system was installed to protect workers from falling and was the first such safety system installed on a steel structure in the city 81 the tower reached 52 floors and was over 600 feet  180m tall by december 2010 the towers steel frame was halfway complete by then 82 but grew to 82 floors by the tenth anniversary of the september 11 attacks at which time its concrete flooring had reached 72 floors and the glass cladding had reached 56 floors 83 in 2009 the port authority changed the official name of the building from freedom tower to one world trade center stating that this name was the easiest for people to identify with 1 84 the change came after board members of the port authority voted to sign a 21-year lease deal with vantone industrial co a chinese real estate company which will become the buildings first commercial tenant vantone plans to create the china center a trade and cultural facility covering 191,000 square feet on floors 64 through 69 85 detailed floor plans of the tower were posted on the new york citys department of finance website in may 2011 resulting in an uproar from the media and citizens of the surrounding area who warned that the plans could potentially be used for a future terrorist attack 86 while under construction the tower was specially illuminated on several occasions 87 on the weekend of july 4 2011 it was lit up with the colors of the american flag to commemorate independence day and it was lit up with the same colors on september 11 to mark the 10th anniversary of the september 11 terrorist attacks 88 on october 27 of that same year it was illuminated with pink in honor of breast cancer awareness month 87 on december 11 the port authority illuminated the tower with multicolored lights to celebrate the holiday season 87 on february 24 2012 the building was lit up with red in honor of archbishop of new york timothy dolan who became a cardinal on february 18 87 on june 14 2012 it was illuminated with red white and blue to honor flag day 87 in august it was illuminated with red in honor of the armed forces 87 on september 8 2012 it was once again illuminated with red white and blue to honor the 11th anniversary of the september 11 attacks 89 on june 24 2013 the building was again illuminated with red white and blue to celebrate the fourth of july 87 on november 12 2013 three hundred red white and blue lights were lit up 90 the towers loading dock however was not due to be finished in time to move equipment into the completed building so five temporary loading bays were added at a cost of millions of dollars the temporary path station was not to be removed until its official replacement the world trade center transportation hub was completed blocking access to the planned loading area 91 by march 2012 one world trade centers steel structure had reached 93 floors 92 growing to 94 floors and 1,240 feet  380m by the end of the month 93 however because the floor numberings were based on standard measurements the 94th floor was numbered floor 100 because the extra space was occupied by the high-ceilinged 91st floor which was used for mechanical purposes 93 the still-incomplete tower became new york citys tallest building by roof height in april 2012 passing the 1,250-foot  380m roof height of the empire state building 94 95 president barack obama visited the construction site two months later and wrote on a steel beam that would be hoisted to the top of the tower the sentence we remember we rebuild we come back stronger 96 that same month with the towers structure nearing completion the owners of the building began a public marketing campaign for the building seeking to attract visitors and tenants 97 one world trade centers steel structure topped out at the nominal 104th floor with a total height of 1,368 feet  417m in august 2012 69 98 the towers antenna was shipped to new york in november 2012 99 the first section of the antenna was hoisted to the top of the tower on december 12 2012 100 and was installed on january 15 2013 101 by march 2013 two sections of the antenna had been installed the spires completion was scheduled for april 29 2013 but bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces 102 on may 10 2013 the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of one world trade center bringing the tower to its full height of 1,776 feet  541m and making it the fourth-tallest building in the world as well as the tallest in the city surpassing the 1,454-foot  443m empire state building 69 103 in subsequent months the exterior elevator shaft was removed the podium glass interior decorations and other finishings were being installed and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed 92 a report in september 2013 revealed that at the time of the report the world trade center association wtca was negotiating with regard to the world trade center name as the wtca had purchased the rights to the name in 1986 the wtca sought $500,000 worth of free office space in the tower in exchange for the use of world trade center in the towers name and associated souvenirs 104 on november 12 2013 the height committee of the chicago-based council on tall buildings and urban habitat ctbuh made the controversial 105 announcement that one world trade center was the tallest building in the united states at 1,776 feet declaring that the mast on top of the building is a spire since it is a permanent part of the buildings architecture 106 107 by the same reasoning the building was also the tallest in the western hemisphere 108 the original twin towers c 2000 one world trade center under construction behind the world financial center in june 2011 one world trade center under construction to the left as seen from a helicopter on april 30 2012 the original twin towers c 2000 one world trade center under construction behind the world financial center in june 2011 one world trade center under construction to the left as seen from a helicopter on april 30 2012 opening and post-opening on november 1 2014 moving trucks started moving items for the towers first tenant magazine publisher condé nast from its old headquarters in times square to one world trade center the new york times noted that the area around the world trade center had transitioned from a financial area to one with technology firms residences and luxury shops coincident with the building of the new tower 109 the building opened on november 3 2014 and condé nast employees moved into spaces spread among 24 floors 110 111 112 113 condé nast occupies floors 20 to 44 having completed its move in early 2015 109 it is expected that the company will attract new tenants to occupy the remaining 40 of unleased space in the tower 109 as condé nast had revitalized times square after moving there in 1999 114 only about 170 of 3,400 total employees moved into the new tower on the first day future tenants will include kids creative legends hospitality the bmb group servcorp 115 and gq 114 on november 12 2014 the supporting wire rope cables of a suspended working platform slacked the cables were manufactured by tractel and they were used to hold workers who performed maintenance on the buildings exterior at the time the platform was holding a two-man seiu-affiliated window washing team the slack caused the platform to hang almost vertically near the 68th floor of the tower the workers were rescued by over 100 fdny firefighters who used a diamond saw to cut through the glass after the incident the workers suffered from a slight case of hypothermia and were taken to the hospital 116 117 118 estimated cost and funding an estimate in february 2007 placed the initial construction cost of one world trade center at about $3 billion or $1,150 per square foot $12,380 per square meter 119 however the towers total estimated construction cost had risen to $3.9 billion by april 2012 making it the most expensive building in the world at the time 2 3 the towers construction was partly funded by approximately $1billion of insurance money that silverstein received for his losses in the september 11 attacks 119 the state of new york provided an additional $250million and the port authority agreed to give $1billion which would be obtained through the sale of bonds 120 the port authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds with a 56percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015 however the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the towers construction 3 121 architecture and design many of daniel libeskinds original concepts from the 2002 competition were discarded from the towers final design one world trade centers final design consisted of simple symmetries and a more traditional profile intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary new york skyline the towers central spire draws from previous buildings such as the empire state building and the chrysler building it also visually resembles the original twin towers rather than being an off-center spire similar to the statue of liberty 122 123 124 125 126 the building occupies a 200-foot  61m square with an area of 40,000 square feet  3,700m2 nearly identical to the footprints of the original twin towers the tower is built upon a 185-foot  56m tall windowless concrete base designed to protect it from truck bombs and other ground-level attacks 127 originally the base was to be covered in decorative prismatic glass but a simpler glass-and-steel façade was adopted when the prisms proved unworkable 69 the current base cladding consists of angled glass fins protruding from stainless steel panels similar to those on 7 world trade center led lights behind the panels illuminate the base at night 128 cable-net glass façades on all four sides of the building for the higher floors designed by schlaich bergermann will be consistent with the other buildings in the complex the façades are 60 feet  18m high and range in width from 30 feet  9.1m on the east and west sides 50 feet  15m on the north side and 70 feet  21m on the south side 10 the curtain wall was manufactured and assembled by benson industries in portland oregon using glass made in minnesota by viracon 129 from the 20th floor upwards the square edges of the towers cubic base are chamfered back shaping the building into eight tall isosceles triangles or an elongated square antiprism 130 near its middle the tower forms a perfect octagon and then culminates in a glass parapet whose shape is a square oriented 45 degrees from the base a 408-foot  124 m sculpted mast containing the broadcasting antenna designed in a collaboration between skidmore owings and merrill som artist kenneth snelson who invented the tensegrity structure lighting designers and engineers is secured by a system of cables and rises from a circular support ring which contains additional broadcasting and maintenance equipment at night an intense beam of light is projected horizontally from the spire 8 and shines over 1,000 feet  300m above the tower 131 david childs of som the architect of one world trade center said the following regarding the towers design 132 we really wanted our design to be grounded in something that was very real not just in sculptural sketches we explored the infrastructural challenges because the proper solution would have to be compelling not just beautiful the design does have great sculptural implications and we fully understand the iconic importance of the tower but it also has to be a highly efficient building the discourse about freedom tower has often been limited to the symbolic formal and aesthetic aspects but we recognize that if this building doesnt function well if people dont want to work and visit there then we will have failed as architects 132 layout just south of the new one world trade center is the national september 11 memorial  museum which is located where the original twin towers stood immediately to the east is world trade center transportation hub and the new two world trade center site to the north is seven world trade center and to the west is brookfield place 133 134 135 one world trade centers top floor is officially designated as floor 104 4 despite the fact that the tower only contains 94 actual stories 136 the building has 86 usable above-ground floors of which 78 are intended for office purposes approximately 2,600,000 square feet  240,000m2 8 137 138 the base consists of floors 1–19 including a 65-foot-high  20 m public lobby the office floors begin at floor 20 and go up to floor 63 there is a sky lobby on floor 64 office floors resume on floor 65 and stop at floor 90 floors 91–99 and 103–104 are mechanical floors 10 the tower has a three-story observation deck located on floors 100–102 in addition to existing broadcast and antenna facilities 10 similar to in the empire state building visitors will be separated from the tenants having their own separate entrance next to the museum descending down to a below-ground security screening area 139 on the observation deck the actual viewing space is on the 100th floor but there will be a food court on the 101st floor and a space for events for the 102nd floor 140 to show visitors the city and give them information and stories about new york an interactive tool called city pulse is used by tour ambassadors the admission fee will be $32 per person 141 142 but admission discounts are available for children and seniors and the deck will be free for 9/11 responders and families of 9/11 victims 140 when it opens the deck is expected to have about 3.5 million visitors per year 143 tickets went on sale starting on april 8 144 however the manhattan district attorney probed the port authority about the firm to which it awarded a contract to operate the deck 145 it officially opened on may 28 2015 146 147 one day ahead of schedule 148 there are three eating venues at the top of the building a café called one café a bar and small plates grill one mix and a fine dining restaurant one dining some have criticized the food prices the need of a full observatory ticket purchase to enter and their reputations compared to windows on the world the top-floor restaurant in the original one world trade center 149 150 the tenants have access to below-ground parking storage and shopping access to path new york city subway trains and the world financial center is also provided at the world trade center transportation hub fulton streetfulton center chambers street and cortlandt street stations 151 the building allows direct access to west street vesey street and fulton street at ground level 151 the building has an approximate underground footprint of 42,000 square feet  3,900m2 151 of which 55,000 square feet  5,100m2 is retail space a plan to build a restaurant near the top of the tower similar to the original one world trade centers windows on the world was abandoned as logistically impractical the towers window-washing tracks are located on a 16-square-foot area which will be designated as floor 110 as a symbolic reference to the 110 floors of the original tower 152 view of manhattan from the observatory brooklyn bridge as viewed from the observatory west street viewed from the observatory statue of liberty as viewed from the observatory view of manhattan from the observatory brooklyn bridge as viewed from the observatory west street viewed from the observatory statue of liberty as viewed from the observatory design evolution the original design went through significant changes after the durst organization joined the port authority of new york and new jersey as the co-developer of the project in 2010 122 the 185-foot  56m tall base corners were originally designed to gently slope upward and have prismatic glass 122 125 the corners were later squared in addition the bases walls are now covered in hundreds of pairs of 13-foot vertical glass fins set against horizontal bands of eight-inch-wide stainless-steel slats 122 125 the spire was originally to be enclosed with a protective radome described as a sculptural sheath of interlocking fiberglass panels 122 123 124 however the radome-enclosed spire was changed to a plain antenna 122 douglas durst the chairman of the durst organization stated that the design change would save $20 million 124 153 however the towers architect skidmore owings  merrill strongly criticized the change david childs the lead designer said eliminating this integral part of the buildings design and leaving an exposed antenna and equipment is unfortunatewe stand ready to work with the port on an alternate design 124 after joining the project in 2010 the durst organization had suggested eliminating the radome to reduce costs but the proposal was rejected by the port authoritys then-executive director christopher o ward 124 ward was replaced by patrick foye in september 2011 123 foye changed the port authoritys position and the radome was removed from the plans in 2012 douglas durst gave a statement regarding the final decision the antenna is going to be mounted on the building over the summer theres no way to do anything at this point 124 the large triangular plaza on the west side of one world trade center facing the hudson river was originally planned to have stainless steel steps descending to the street however the steps were changed to a terrace in the final design the terrace can be accessed through a staircase on vesey street the terrace is paved in granite and has 12 sweetgum trees in addition to a block-long planterbench 122 durst also removed a skylight from the plazas plans the skylight was designed to allow natural light to enter the below-ground observation deck lobby 122 the plaza is 5ft 8in  1.73m higher than the adjacent sidewalk 122 the port authority formally approved all these revisions and the revisions were first reported by the new york post 154 patrick foye the executive director of the port authority said that he thought that the changes were few and minor in a telephone interview 122 a contract negotiated between the port authority and the durst organization states that the durst organization will receive a $15 million fee and a percentage of base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project the specifics of the signed contract give durst 75 percent of the savings up to $24 million with further returns going down to 50 percent 25 percent and 15 percent as the savings increase 122 height the top floor of one world trade center is 1,368 feet  417m above ground level along with a 33ft 4in  10.16m parapet this is identical to the roof height of the original one world trade center 155 the towers antennaspire brings it to a pinnacle height of 1,776 feet  541m 4 156 a figure intended to symbolize the year 1776 when the united states declaration of independence was signed 8 157 158 159 if the antenna is included in the buildings height as stated by the council on tall buildings and urban habitat ctbuh one world trade center surpasses the height of taipei 101  1,671-foot  509m is the worlds tallest all-office building and the fourth-tallest skyscraper in the world behind the burj khalifa 30 abraj al bait 160 and shanghai tower 161 one world trade center is the second-tallest freestanding structure in the western hemisphere as the cn tower in toronto exceeds one world trade centers pinnacle height by approximately 12m  39.4ft 162 the chicago spire with a planned height of 2,000 feet  610m was expected to exceed the height of one world trade center but its construction was canceled due to financial difficulties in 2009 163 after design changes for one world trade centers spire were revealed in may 2012 there were questions as to whether the 408-foot  124m-tall structure would still qualify as a spire and thus be included in the buildings height 164 165 since the towers spire is not enclosed in a radome as originally planned it could be classified as a simple antenna which is not included in a buildings height according to the ctbuh 165 without the antenna one world trade center would be 1,368 feet  417m tall making it the fourth-tallest building in the united states behind the willis tower and trump international hotel  tower both located in chicago and 432 park avenue in new york 166 167 the building is currently the tallest in new york city with the antenna however without the antenna it was surpassed in 2015 by 432 park avenue which topped out at 1,396 feet  426m high 168 169 170 one world trade centers developers have disputed the claim that the spire should be reclassified as an antenna following the redesign 171 with port authority spokesman steve coleman reiterating that one world trade center will be the tallest building in the western hemisphere 164 in 2012 the ctbuh announced that it would wait to make its final decision as to whether or not the redesigned spire would count towards the buildings height 164 on november 12 2013 the ctbuh announced that one world trade centers spire would count as part of the buildings recognized height giving it a final height of 1,776feet and making it the tallest building in the western hemisphere 106 sustainability like other buildings in the new world trade center complex one world trade center includes sustainable architecture features much of the buildings structure and interior is built from recycled materials including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles around 80percent of the towers waste products are recycled 172 although the roof area of any tower is limited the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems the buildings purecell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts mw of power and its waste steam generates electricity 173 the new york power authority selected utc power to provide the towers fuel cell system which was one of the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed 174 the tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power 175 the windows are made of an ultra-clear glass which allows maximum sunlight to pass through the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days reducing energy costs 131 like all of the new facilities at the world trade center site one world trade center is heated by steam with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site 176 one world trade center is expected to receive a leadership in energy and environmental design leed gold certification making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world 177 safety and security security features along with the protection provided by the reinforced concrete base a number of other safety features were included in the buildings design so that it would be prepared for a major accident or terrorist attack like 7 world trade center the building has 3-foot  91cm thick reinforced concrete walls in all stairwells elevator shafts risers and sprinkler systems there are also extra-wide pressurized stairwells along with a dedicated set of stairwells exclusively for the use of firefighters and biological and chemical filters throughout the ventilation system 131 177 in comparison the original twin towers used a purely steel central core to house utility functions protected only by lightweight drywall panels 178 the building is no longer 25 feet  8m away from west street as the twin towers were at its closest point west street is 65 feet  20m away the windows facing west street are equipped with specially tempered blast-resistant plastic which looks almost like the glass used in the other sides of the building 131 the port authority has stated its structure is designed around a strong redundant steel moment frame consisting of beams and columns connected by a combination of welding and bolting paired with a concrete-core shear wall the moment frame lends substantial rigidity and redundancy to the overall building structure while providing column-free interior spans for maximum flexibility 177 in addition to safety design new security measures will be implemented all vehicles will be screened for radioactive materials and other potentially dangerous objects before they enter the site through the underground road four hundred closed-circuit surveillance cameras will be placed in and around the site with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the nypd a computer system will use video-analytic computer software designed to detect potential threats such as unattended bags and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects new york city and port authority police will patrol the site 179 once the world trade center site is fully completed the plaza will be completely opened to the public as the original world trade center plaza was 180 the initial stage of the opening process began on thursday may 15 2014 when the interim operating period of the national september 11 memorial ended during this period all visitors were required to undergo airport style security screening 181 as part of the interim operating period which was expected to end on december 31 2013 182 however screening did not fully end until the official dedication and opening of the museum 183 184 on may 21 2014 after which visitors were allowed to use the plaza without needing passes 180 incidents in march 2014 the tower was scaled by 16-year-old new jersey resident justin casquejo who entered the site through a hole in a fence he was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges 185 he allegedly dressed like a construction worker sneaked in and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the towers 88th floor according to news sources he then used stairways to get to the 104th floor walked past a sleeping security guard and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna where he took pictures for two hours 186 the elevator operator was reassigned and the guard was fired 187 188 it was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower which facilitated casquejos entry to the site 189 190 less than a week after the trespassing incident four peoplethree male parachutists one of whom was a construction worker at the site and their lookoutwere arrested for a base jump they conducted on september 30 2013 191 192 they had posted a video of the jump online 193 as a result of these incidents the durst organizations head of security at one world trade center david velazquez resigned on march 28 2014 194 controversies the social center of the previous one world trade center included a restaurant on the 107th floor called windows on the world and the greatest bar on earth these were tourist attractions in their own right and a gathering spot for people who worked in the towers 195 196 this restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the united states called windows on the world wine school run by wine personality kevin zraly 197 despite numerous assurances that these attractions would be rebuilt 198 the port authority scrapped plans to rebuild them which has outraged some observers 199 the fortified base of the tower has also been a source of controversy some critics including deroy murdock of the national review 200 have said that it is alienating and dull and reflects a sense of fear rather than freedom leading them to dub the building the fear tower 201 nicolai ouroussoff the architecture critic for the new york times calls the tower base a grotesque attempt to disguise its underlying paranoia 202 statue in front of the building the americas response monument a life-and-a-half scale bronze statue commemorating the actions of us special operations forces in the first few weeks of the war in afghanistan was unveiled to the public during the veterans day parade in new york city on november 11 2011 the statue was displayed on a float which traveled along fifth avenue north from 23rd street to 56th street 203 it was dedicated that same day in a ceremony led by vice president joe biden and lieutenant-general john mulholland commander of us army special operations command and formerly commander of task force dagger during the initial days of the war in afghanistan 204 205 it was temporarily located in the west street lobby inside one world financial center in new york city opposite ground zero 204 205 it is the first public monument to honor united states special forces 206 207 there is also a monument commemorating the green berets on meadows memorial field in fort bragg north carolina 208 on october 19 2012 the monument was rededicated in front of the tower 207 the inscription at base of the sculpture bears its name americas response monument and the latin subtitle de oppresso liber the subtitle traditionally translated as to free the oppressed is the motto of the green berets who inspired the monument 209 a piece of steel from the original world trade center is embedded in the base 210 the statue was dedicated by lieutenant general john mulholland deputy commanding general of us army special forces command soldiers representing the united states army special operations command attended the dedication ceremony 211 the land on which the monument stands was donated by a private wall street firm 212 the statue cost over $750,000 to make but all the needed money was donated by hundreds of private citizens including some survivors of the september 11 attacks 213 214 owners and tenants one world trade center is principally owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey around 5percent equity of the building was sold to the durst organization a private real estate company in exchange for an investment of at least $100million the durst organization assisted in supervising the buildings construction and manages the building for the port authority having responsibility for leasing property management and tenant installations 215 216 by september 2012 around 55percent of the buildings floor space had been leased 217 but no new leases were signed for three years until may 2014 218 the amount of space leased had gone up to 62.8percent by november 2014 219 in 2006 the state of new york agreed to a 15-year 415,000 square feet  38,600m2 lease with an option to extend the leases term and occupy up to 1,000,000 square feet  90,000m2 220 the general services administration gsa initially agreed to a lease of around 645,000 square feet  59,900m2 176 220 and new york states office of general services ogs planned to occupy around 412,000 square feet  38,300m2 however the gsa ceded most of its floor space to the port authority in july 2011 and the ogs withdrew from the lease contract 221 in april 2008 the port authority announced that it was seeking a bidder to operate the 18,000sqft  1,700m2 observation deck on the towers 102nd floor 222 in 2013 legends hospitality management agreed to operate the observatory in a 15-year $875 million contract 223 the buildings first lease a joint project between the port authority and beijing-based vantone industrial was announced on march 28 2009 a 190,810sqft  17,727m2 china center combining business and

square feet  10,000m2 of space occupying floors 42 through 44 228 conde nast moved in on november 3 2014 110 111 however some leases had failed in january 2012 chadbourne  parke a midtown manhattan-based law firm was to sign a 300,000 square feet  30,000m2 lease contract 229 but after negotiations broke down the deal was abruptly canceled in march 230 key figures developer larry silverstein of silverstein properties the leaseholder and developer of the complex retains control of the surrounding buildings while the port authority has full control of the tower itself silverstein signed a 99-year lease for the world trade center site in july 2001 and remains actively involved in most aspects of the sites redevelopment process 231 before construction of the new tower began silverstein was involved in an insurance dispute regarding the tower the terms of the lease agreement signed in 2001 for which silverstein paid $14 million 232 gave silverstein as leaseholder the right and obligation to rebuild the structures if they were destroyed 233 after the september 11 attacks there were a series of disputes between silverstein and insurance companies concerning the insurance policies that covered the original towers this resulted in the construction of one world trade center being delayed after a trial resulted a verdict was given on april 29 2004 the verdict was that ten of the insurers involved in the dispute were subject to the one occurrence interpretation so their liability was limited to the face value of those policies three insurers were added to the second trial group 234 235 at that time the jury was unable to reach a verdict on one insurer swiss reinsurance but it did so several days later on may 3 2004 finding that this company was also subject to the one occurrence interpretation 236 silverstein appealed the swiss reinsurance decision but the appeal failed on october 19 2006 237 the second trial resulted in a verdict on december 6 2004 the jury determined that nine insurers were subject to the two occurrences interpretation referring to the fact that two different planes had destroyed the towers during the september 11 attacks they were therefore liable for a maximum of double the face value of those particular policies $2.2 billion 238 the highest potential payout was $4.577 billion for buildings 1 2 4 and 5 239 in march 2007 silverstein appeared at a rally of construction workers and public officials outside an insurance industry conference he highlighted what he describes as the failures of insurers allianz and royal  sun alliance to pay $800 million in claims related to the attacks insurers state that an agreement to split payments between silverstein and the port authority is a cause for concern 240 key project coordinators david childs one of silversteins favorite architects joined the project after silverstein urged him to do so he developed a design proposal for one world trade center initially collaborating with daniel libeskind in may 2005 childs revised the design to address security concerns he is the architect of the tower and is responsible for overseeing its day-to-day design and development 241 architect daniel libeskind won the invitational competition to develop a plan for the new tower in 2002 he gave an initial proposal which he called memory foundations for the design of one world trade center his design included aerial gardens windmills and off-center spire 126 libeskind later denied a request to place the tower in a more rentable location next to the path station he instead placed it another block west as it would then line up with and resemble the statue of liberty 242 most of libeskinds original designs were later scrapped and other architects were chosen to design the other wtc buildings 243 however one element of libeskinds initial plan was included in the final design the towers symbolic height of 1,776 feet  541m 244 daniel r tishman along with his father john tishman builder of the original world trade center led the construction team from tishman realty  construction the selected builder for one world trade center 245 246 douglas and jody durst the co-presidents of the durst organization a real estate development company won the right to invest at least $100million in the project on july 7 2010 247 in august 2010 condé nast a long-time durst tenant confirmed a tentative deal to move into 1 world trade center 248 249 250 and finalized the deal on may 26 2011 251 the contract negotiated between the port authority and the durst organization specifies that the durst organization will receive a $15 million fee and a percentage of base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project the specifics of the signed contract give durst 75 percent of savings up to $24 million stepping down to 50 25 and 15 percent as savings increase 122 since durst joined the project significant changes have been made to the building including the 185 foot base of the tower the spire and the plaza to the west of the building facing the hudson river the port authority has approved all the revisions 122 port authority construction workers a woodsearch films short-subject documentary entitled how does it feel to work on one world trade center was uploaded to youtube on august 31 2010 it depicted construction workers who were satisfied with the working conditions at the construction site 252 however further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of one world trade center including 34 not reported to the us occupational safety and health administration 253 workers also left post-9/11-related graffiti at the site which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience 254 see also architecture portal new york city portal one world trade center in popular culture architecture of new york
