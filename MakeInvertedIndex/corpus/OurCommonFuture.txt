our common future our common future also known as the brundtland report from the united nations world commission on environment and development wced was published in 1987 its targets were multilateralism and interdependence of nations in the search for a sustainable development path the report sought to recapture the spirit of the stockholm conference - which had introduced environmental concerns to the formal political development sphere our common future placed environmental issues firmly on the political agenda it aimed to discuss the environment and development as one single issue the document was the culmination of a “900-day international-exercise which catalogued analysed and synthesised written submissions and expert testimony from senior government representatives scientists and experts research institutes industrialists representatives of non-governmental organizations and the general public held at public hearings throughout the world the brundtland commissions mandate was to 1 the brundtland commission report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction gender equity and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed as such the report offered the analysis the broad remedies and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development within such societies  1987 16 however the report was unable to identify the modes of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth the report postulated that such growth could be reformed and expanded this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development 2 the publication of our common future and the work of the world commission on environment and development laid the groundwork for the convening of the 1992 earth summit and the adoption of agenda 21 the rio declaration and to the establishment of the commission on sustainable development an oft-quoted definition of sustainable development is defined in the report as in addition key contributions of our common future to the concept of sustainable development include the recognition that the many crises facing the planet are interlocking crises that are elements of a single crisis of the whole  3 and of the vital need for the active participation of all sectors of society in
