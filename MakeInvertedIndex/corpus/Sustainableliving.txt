sustainable living sustainable living is a lifestyle that attempts to reduce an individuals or societys use of the earths natural resources and personal resources 1 practitioners of sustainable living often attempt to reduce their carbon footprint by altering methods of transportation energy consumption and diet 2 proponents of sustainable living aim to conduct their lives in ways that are consistent with sustainability in natural balance and respectful of humanitys symbiotic relationship with the earths natural ecology and cycles 3 the practice and general philosophy of ecological living is highly interrelated with the overall principles of sustainable development 4 lester r brown a prominent environmentalist and founder of the worldwatch institute and earth policy institute describes sustainable living in the twenty-first century as shifting to a renewable energybased reuserecycle economy with a diversified transport system 5 in addition to this philosophy practical eco-village builders like living villages maintain that the shift to renewable technologies will only be successful if the resultant built environment is attractive to a local culture and can be maintained and adapted as necessary over the generations  contents 1 definition 2 history 3 shelter 3.1 sustainable building materials 4 power 4.1 list of organic matter than can be burned for fuel 5

fundamentally the application of sustainability to lifestyle choice and decisions one conception of sustainable living expresses what it means in triple-bottom-line terms as meeting present ecological societal and economical needs without compromising these factors for future generations 7 8 another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected social domains economics ecology politics and culture in the first conception sustainable living can be described as living within the innate carrying capacities defined by these factors in the second or circles of sustainability conception sustainable living can be described as negotiating the relationships of needs within limits across all the interconnected domains of social life including consequences for future human generations and non-human species 9 sustainable design and sustainable development are critical factors to sustainable living sustainable design encompasses the development of appropriate technology which is a staple of sustainable living practices 10 sustainable development in turn is the use of these technologies in infrastructure sustainable architecture and agriculture are the most common examples of this practice 11 historyedit 1954 the publication of living the good life by helen and scott nearing marked the beginning of the modern day sustainable living movement the publication paved the way for the back-to-the-land movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s 12 13 1962 the publication of silent spring by rachel carson marked another major milestone for the sustainability movement 14 1972 donella meadows wrote the international bestseller the limits to growth which reported on a study of long-term global trends in population economics and the environment it sold millions of copies and was translated into 28 languages 15 1973 e f schumacher published a collection of essays on shifting towards sustainable living through the appropriate use of technology in his book small is beautiful 16 1992â€“2002 the united nations held a series of conferences which focused on increasing sustainability within societies to conserve the earths natural resources the earth summit conferences were held in 1992 1972 and 2002 17 2007 the united nations published sustainable consumption and production promoting climate-friendly household consumption patterns which promoted sustainable lifestyles in communities and homes 18 shelteredit on a global scale shelter is associated with about 25 of the greenhouse gas emissions embodied in household purchases and 26 of households land use 19 sustainable homes are built using sustainable methods materials and facilitate green practices enabling a more sustainable lifestyle their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the earth often if necessary they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores schools daycares work or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices 20 sometimes they are off-the-grid homes that do not require any public energy water or sewer service if not off-the-grid sustainable homes may be linked to a grid supplied by a power plant that is using sustainable power sources buying power as is normal convention additionally sustainable homes may be connected to a grid but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility there are two common methods to approaching this option net metering and double metering 21 net metering uses the common meter that is installed in most homes running forward when power is used from the grid and running backward when power is put into the grid which allows them to net out their total energy use putting excess energy into the grid when not needed and using energy from the grid during peak hours when you may not be able to produce enough immediately power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid as it is being produced double metering involves installing two meters one measuring electricity consumed the other measuring electricity created additionally or in place of selling their renewable energy sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries this gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times ie night-time when there has been no wind etc and to be completely independent of the electrical grid 22 sustainably designed see sustainable design houses  23 are generally sited so as to create as little of a negative impact on the surrounding ecosystem as possible oriented to the sun so that it creates the best possible microclimate typically the long axis of the house or building should be oriented east-west and provide natural shading or wind barriers where and when needed among many other considerations the design of a sustainable shelter affords the options it has later ie using passive solar lighting and heating creating temperature buffer zones by adding porches deep overhangs to help create favorable microclimates etc 22 24 sustainably constructed houses involve environmentally friendly management of waste building materials such as recycling and composting use non-toxic and renewable recycled reclaimed or low-impact production materials that have been created and treated in a sustainable fashion such as using organic or water-based finishes use as much locally available materials and tools as possible so as to reduce the need for transportation and use low-impact production methods methods that minimize effects on the environment 25 26 many materials can be considered a green material until its background is revealed any material that has used toxic or carcinogenic chemicals in its treatment or manufacturing such as formaldehyde in glues used in woodworking has traveled extensively from its source or manufacturer or has been cultivated or harvested in an unsustainable manner might not be considered green in order for any material to be considered green it must be resource efficient not compromise indoor air quality or water conservation and be energy efficient both in processing and when in use in the shelter 26 resource efficiency can be achieved by using as much recycled content reusable or recyclable content materials that employ recycled or recyclable packaging locally available material salvaged or remanufactured material material that employs resource efficient manufacturing and long-lasting material as possible 27 sustainable building materialsedit some building materials might be considered sustainable by some definitions and under some conditions for example wood might be thought of as sustainable if it is grown using sustainable forest management processed using sustainable energy delivered by sustainable transport etc under different conditions however it might not be considered as sustainable the following materials might be considered as sustainable under certain conditions based on a life-cycle assessment adobe bamboo cellulose insulation cob composite wood when made from reclaimed hardwood sawdust and reclaimed or recycled plastic compressed earth block cordwood cork hemp insulating concrete forms lime render linoleum lumber from forest stewardship council approved sources natural rubber natural fiber coir wool jute etc organic cotton insulation papercrete rammed earth reclaimed stone reclaimed brick recycled metal recycled concrete recycled paper soy-based adhesive soy insulation straw bale structural insulated panel wood insulation of a sustainable home is important because of the energy it conserves throughout the life of the home well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or in combination with a house that is well designed eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used typically lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters walls with cavities are done in much the same manner for walls that do not have cavities behind them solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install 24 energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation simply assuring that windows and doors are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home 21 double or triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out 22 26 low-emissivity or low-e glass is another option for window insulation it is a coating on windowpanes of a thin transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation 24 superwindows mentioned in natural capitalism creating the next industrial revolution became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies including two to three transparent low-e coatings multiple panes of glass and a heavy gas filling although more expensive they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows 28 equipping roofs with highly reflective material such as aluminum increases a roofs albedo and will help reduce the amount of heat it absorbs hence the amount of energy needed to cool the building it is on green roofs or living roofs are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building they are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and when in the broader picture of a community reduce the heat island effect see urban heat island thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area it is arguable that they are able to replace the physical footprint that the building creates helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the buildings presence 29 30 energy efficiency and water conservation are also major considerations in sustainable housing if using appliances computers hvac systems electronics or lighting the sustainable-minded often look for an energy star label which is government-backed and holds stricter regulations in energy and water efficiency than is required by law 31 32 ideally a sustainable shelter should be able to completely run the appliances it uses using renewable energy and should strive to have a neutral impact on the earths water sources 33 greywater including water from washing machines sinks showers and baths may be reused in landscape irrigation and toilets as a method of water conservation likewise rainwater harvesting from storm-water runoff is also a sustainable method to conserve water use in a sustainable shelter 34 sustainable urban drainage systems replicate the natural systems that clean water in wildlife and implement them in a citys drainage system so as to minimize contaminated water and unnatural rates of runoff into the environment 35 36 see related articles in leed leadership in energy and environmental design poweredit as mentioned under shelter some sustainable households may choose to produce their own renewable energy while others may choose to purchase it through the grid from a power company that harnesses sustainable sources also mentioned previously are the methods of metering the production and consumption of electricity in a household purchasing sustainable energy however may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability 6 out of the 50 states in the us do not offer green energy for example for those that do its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid technically in this case the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it 37 in this case it is possible that the amount of green electricity that the buying household receives is a small fraction of their total incoming electricity this may or may not depend on the amount being purchased the purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utilitys effort in producing sustainable energy 38 producing sustainable energy on an individual household or community basis is much more flexible but can still be limited in the richness of the sources that the location may afford some locations may not be rich in renewable energy sources while others may have an abundance of it when generating renewable energy and feeding it back into the grid in participating countries such as the us and germany producing households are typically paid at least the full standard electricity rate by their utility and are also given separate renewable energy credits that they can then sell to their utility additionally utilities are interested in buying these renewable energy credits because it allows them to claim that they produce renewable energy in some special cases producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate but this is not common 39 solar power harnesses the energy of the sun to make electricity two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are photo-voltaic cells that are organized into panels and concentrated solar power which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an electrical generator via a steam turbine or heat engine or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells 40 41 the energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a direct current and has to be converted to alternating current before it can be used in a household at this point users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use or use an acdc inverter for immediate use to get the best out of a solar panel the angle of incidence of the sun should be between 20 and 50 degrees solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases it has the advantages of being portable easy to use on an individual basis readily available for government grants and incentives and being flexible regarding location though it is most efficient when used in hot arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny 38 41 for those that are lucky affordable rental schemes may be found 38 concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a parabolic reflector 41 42 solar thermal energy is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun one of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through solar water heating in a broad perspective these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors are either passive or active systems active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank and in active systems involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system instead they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank 43 other methods of harnessing solar power are solar space heating for heating internal building spaces solar drying for drying wood chips fruits grains etc solar cookers solar distillers and other passive solar technologies simply harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means wind power is harnessed through turbines set on tall towers typically 20 or 6m with 10 or 3m diameter blades for an individual households needs that power a generator that creates electricity 38 41 they typically require an average of wind speed of 9mihr  14kmhr to be worth their investment as prescribed by the us department of energy and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 30  10m in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions such as neighboring buildings mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce their appearance and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds their blades obstruct passage in the sky wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas 38 and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt approaching the cost of fossil fuels and have quick paybacks 41 for those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed or falling from an adequate height on their property hydroelectricity may be an option on a large scale hydroelectricity in the form of dams has adverse environmental and social impacts when on a small scale however in the form of single turbines hydroelectricity is very sustainable single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive on an individual household basis single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production it is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household 38 geothermal energy production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earths surface in reservoirs to produce energy because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir this source is considered sustainable however those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited they cool down over time making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible this method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment there do exist small individual scale geothermal operations however which harness reservoirs very close to the earths surface avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression in this case the heat is captured and sent to a geothermal heat pump system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it often this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months 42 although geothermal energy is available everywhere on earth practicality and cost-effectiveness varies directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs places such as the philippines hawaii alaska iceland california and nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the earths surface making its production cost-effective 41 biomass power is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel as with the case of using green materials in a household it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation although burning biomass for fuel releases carbon dioxide sulfur compounds and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle the amount that is released is sustainable it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere this is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime 38 41 however burning biodiesel and bioethanol see biofuel when created from virgin material is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food and may use unsustainable growing methods such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers 38 41 44 list of organic matter than can be burned for fueledit bagasse biogas manure stover straw used vegetable oil wood digestion of organic material to produce methane is becoming an increasingly popular method of biomass energy production materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills full of decomposing waste and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well the advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere exacerbating the greenhouse effect although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale done in landfills it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well 41 foodedit globally food accounts for 48 and 70 of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively with consumption of meat dairy and processed food rising fast with income 45 environmental impacts of industrial agricultureedit industrial agricultural production is highly resource and energy intensive industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy irrigation extensive pesticide and fertilizer application intensive tillage concentrated monoculture production and other continual inputs as a result of these industrial farming conditions todays mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated these stresses include declining water tables chemical leaching chemical runoff soil erosion land degradation loss in biodiversity and other ecological concerns 46 conventional food distribution and long distance transportedit conventional food distribution and long distance transport are additionally resource and energy exhaustive substantial climate-disrupting carbon emissions boosted by the transport of food over long distances are of growing concern as the world faces such global crisis as natural resource depletion peak oil and climate change 47 the average american meal currently costs about 1500 miles and takes about 10 calories of oil and other fossil fuels to produce a single calorie of food 48 local and seasonal foodsedit a more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally buying food from local farmers reduces carbon output caused by long-distance food transport and stimulates the local economy 48 local small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage nutrient cycling fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications 49 adapting a more regional seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport these vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable growing season thus seasonal food farming does not require energy intensive greenhouse production extensive irrigation plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods and other environmental stressors 50 local seasonal produce is typically fresher unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling 51 farmers markets public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions as well as promoting localization of food farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction 52 another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local community-supported agriculture csa a csa consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production csas usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits sometimes including dairy products meat and special food items such as baked goods 53 considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis the united states and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic economical and sociopolitical disasters were to occur 48 reducing meat consumptionedit industrial meat production also involves high environmental costs such as land degradation soil erosion and depletion of natural resources especially pertaining to water and food 50 mass meat production increase the amount of methane in the atmosphere for more information on the environmental impact of meat production and consumption see the ethics of eating meat reducing meat consumption perhaps to a few meals a week or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production buying and consuming organically raised free range or grass fed meat is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption 49 organic farmingedit purchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living organic farming is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability according to the usda national organic standards board nosb organic agriculture is defined as an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity biological cycles and soil biological activity it is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore maintain or enhance ecological harmony the primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life plants animals and people upon sustaining these goals organic agriculture uses techniques such as crop rotation permaculture compost green manure and biological pest control in addition organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides plant growth regulators such as hormones livestock antibiotics food additives and genetically modified organisms 54 organically farmed products include vegetables fruit grains herbs meat dairy eggs fibers and flowers see organic certification for more information urban gardeningedit in addition to local small-scale farms there has been a recent emergence in urban agriculture expanding from community gardens to private home gardens with this trend both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in food production a network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities 55 with every bite of food raised from urban gardens negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways for instance vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of nitrogen fertilizer required for industrial agricultural operations the nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables nitrogen fertilizer also produces nitrous oxide a more damaging greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide local community-grown food also requires no imported long-distance transport which further depletes our fossil fuel reserves 56 in developing more efficiency per land acre urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas in vacant lots public parks private yards church and school yards on roof tops roof-top gardens and many other places communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible 57 aesthetically pleasing edible landscaping plants can also be incorporated into city landscaping such as blueberry bushes grapevines trained on an arbor pecan trees etc 52 with as small a scale as home or community farming sustainable and organic farming methods can easily be utilized such sustainable organic farming techniques include composting biological pest control crop rotation mulching drip irrigation nutrient cycling and permaculture 58 for more information on sustainable farming systems see sustainable agriculture food preservation and storageedit preserving and storing foods reduces reliance on long-distance transported food and the market industry home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket food can be preserved and saved by dehydration freezing vacuum packing canning bottling pickling and jellying 59 for more information see food preservation transportationedit with rising peak oil concerns climate warming exacerbated by carbon emissions and high energy prices the conventional automobile industry is becoming less and less feasible to the conversation of sustainability revisions of urban transport systems that foster mobility low-cost transportation and healthier urban environments are needed such urban transport systems should consist of a combination of rail transport bus transport bicycle pathways and pedestrian walkways public transport systems such as underground rail systems and bus transit systems shift huge numbers of people away from reliance on car mobilization and dramatically reduce the rate of carbon emissions caused by automobile transport 60 carpooling is another alternative for reducing oil consumption and carbon emissions by transit in comparison to automobiles bicycles are a paragon of energy efficient personal transportation with the bicycle roughly 50 times more energy efficient than driving 61 bicycles increase mobility while alleviating congestion lowering air and noise pollution and increasing physical exercise most importantly they do not emit climate-disturbing carbon dioxide 60 bike-sharing programs are beginning to boom throughout the world and are modeled in leading cities such as paris amsterdam and london 62 bike-sharing programs offer kiosks and docking stations that supply hundreds to thousands of bikes for rental throughout a city through small deposits or affordable memberships 63 a recent boom has occurred in electric bikes especially in china and other asian countries electric bikes are similar to plug-in hybrid vehicles in that they are battery powered and can be plugged into the provincial electric grid for recharging as needed in contrast to plug-in hybrid cars electric bikes do not directly use any fossil fuels adequate sustainable urban transportation is dependent upon proper city infrastructure and planning that incorporates efficient public transit along with bicycle and pedestrian-friendly pathways 60 patrick maria johnson was the founder of this wateredit a major factor of sustainable living involves that which no human can live without water unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind currently humans use one-fourth of the earths total fresh water in natural circulation and over half the accessible runoff 64 additionally population growth and water demand is ever increasing thus it is necessary to use available water more efficiently in sustainable living one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple everyday measures these measures involve considering indoor home appliance efficiency outdoor water use and daily water use awareness indoor home appliancesedit housing and commercial buildings account for 12 percent of americas freshwater withdrawals 64 a typical american single family home uses about 70 us gallons  260l per person per day indoors 64 this use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to appliance quality toiletsedit toilets accounted for almost 30 of residential indoor water use in the united states in 1999 65 one flush of a standard us toilet requires more water than most individuals and many families in the world use for all their needs in an entire day 66 a homes toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet to improve the current toilet one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank also there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase a tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank a float booster attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets it allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush a major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks a slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye but can waste hundreds of gallons each month one way to check this is to put food dye in the tank and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color in the event of a leaky flapper one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush if installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model a low flush toilet uses one to two gallons per flush traditionally toilets use three to five gallons per flush if an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place 70 of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30 67 it is possible to have a toilet that uses no water a composting toilet treats human waste through composting and dehydration producing a valuable soil additive 68 these toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces the urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer the feces can be dried and bagged or composted these toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup in addition to providing valuable fertilizer these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve topsoil additionally one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing for instance instead of flushing small wastes such as tissues one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost showersedit on average showers were 18 of us indoor water use in 1999 at 6â€“8 us gallons  23â€“30l per minute traditionally in america 65 a simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow high-performance showerheads these showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less an alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter this device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature solar water heaters can be used to obtain optimal water temperature and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels to lessen excess water use water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation this insulation decreases hot water generation time a simple straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers one method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary such as while lathering and resuming the shower when water is necessary this can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting common in the uk but not the united states dishwashers and sinksedit on average sinks were 15 of us indoor water use in 1999 65 there are however easy methods to rectify excessive water loss available for purchase is a screw-on aerator this device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume reducing water use by half additionally there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature finally a laminar flow device creates a 1.5-2.4 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half but can be turned to normal water level when optimal in addition to buying the above devices one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks and fixing these links if they exist according to the epa a small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons 65 when washing dishes by hand it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously on average dishwashing consumes 1 of indoor water use 65 when using a dishwasher water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full some have a low flow setting to use less water per wash cycle enzymatic detergents clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperaturecitation needed washing machinesedit on average 23 of us indoor water use in 1999 was due to clothes washing 65 in contrast to other machines american washing machines have changed little to become more sustainable a typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water horizontal-axis machines in contrast put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it these machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability outdoor water useedit there are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal yard roof and garden in more sustainable living while conserving water is a major element of sustainability so is sequestering water conserving wateredit in planning a yard and garden space it is most sustainable to consider the plants soil and available water drought resistant shrubs plants and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species additionally native plants as opposed to herbaceous perennials will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area xeriscaping is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as slope soil type and native plant range it can reduce landscape water use by 50  70 while providing habitat space for wildlife plants on slopes help reduce runoff by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste after planting placing a circumference of mulch surrounding plants functions to lessen evaporation to do this firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plants dripline this prevents water runoff when watering consider the range of sprinklers watering paved areas is unnecessary additionally to conserve the maximum amount of water watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period these systems use 30  50 less water than conventional methods 69 soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90 70 they connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch a layer of organic material added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention previously planted areas can be covered with compost in caring for a lawn there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques a primary aspect of lawn care is watering to conserve water it is important to only water when necessary and to deep soak when watering additionally a lawn may be left to go dormant renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality sequestering wateredit a common method of water sequestrations is rainwater harvesting which incorporates the collection and storage of rain primarily the rain is obtained from a roof and stored on the ground in catchment tanks water sequestration varies based on extent cost and complexity a simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout while a more complex method involves multiple tanks it is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets additionally using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff pollution picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains the following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply collection area square feet  rainfall

systems function in sequestering used indoor water such as laundry bath and sink water and filtering it for reuse greywater can be reused in irrigation and toilet flushing there are two types of greywater systems gravity fed manual systems and package systems 72 the manual systems do not require electricity but may require a larger yard space 72 the package systems require electricity but are self-contained and can be installed indoors 72 wasteedit as populations and resource demands climb waste production contributes to emissions of carbon dioxide leaching of hazardous materials into the soil and waterways and methane emissions in america alone over the course of a decade 500 trillion pounds of american resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases 66 thus a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious one can do this by reducing waste reusing commodities and recycling there are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like credit card and insurance offers and direct mail marketing and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of landfill waste in 2009 73 another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk reducing packaging materials preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane 74 another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste 75 by reusing materials one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills reusing saves natural resources by decreasing the necessity of raw material extraction for example reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects recycling a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods recycling incorporates three primary processes collection and processing manufacturing and purchasing recycled products 76 a natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil which can be carried out at home or locally with community composting an offshoot of recycling upcycling strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life 77 by integrating measures of reusing reducing and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use
