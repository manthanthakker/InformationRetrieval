scotland act 1998 gave the name scottish executive as the legal term for the devolved government in january 2001 the then first minister henry mcleish suggested changing the official name from scottish executive to scottish government the reaction from the british government and from some labour party members and scottish labour mps was allegedly hostile 22 this reaction was in contrast to a 2001 public survey by then-labour chief whip tom mccabe which showed that only 29 of the scottish public wanted the title scottish executive to remain 23 scottish politicians including the labour first minister had often referred to the executive as the government and this trend increased following the 2007 election when the snp took office and labour were in opposition for the first time on 2 september 2007 the snp minority government announced that the scottish executive was to be re-branded as the scottish government the renaming was decided unilaterally by the minority government as a consequence the snp was criticised by the three unionist opposition parties for acting without allowing for parliamentary scrutiny debate or approval of their plan however the term scottish government has since then become common currency among all of the political parties in scotland and the rest of the uk 24 the official gaelic title riaghaltas na h-alba has always meant government of scotland scottish executive remained the legal name under section 44 1 of the scotland act 1998 until 2 july 2012 neither the scottish executive nor the scottish parliament were able to change the legal name as this required the british parliament to amend the scotland act section 12 1 of the scotland act 2012 which came into effect on 3 july 2012 formally changed the name of the scottish executive to the scottish government at the same time that the scottish government began to use its new name a new emblem was adopted the earlier version featured the old name and a version of the royal arms for scotland but without the motto the helm the mantling the crest the war-cry above the crest or the flags of scotland and england carried by the supporters in the rendering used both supporters appeared to be crowned with the crown of scotland whereas in the royal arms the scottish unicorn is usually shown crowned with the scottish crown and the english lion with st edwards crown in the september 2007 rebranding this depiction of the royal arms was replaced by one of the flag of scotland however the royal arms are still used by the government for some official documents such as directions issued in exercise of powers provided by legislation 25 in 2016 a refreshed version of the scottish government logo was launched and used on all government websites and letters of correspondence list
