diesel engine the diesel engine correctly known as a compression-ignition or ci engine is an internal combustion engine in which ignition of the fuel that has been injected into the combustion chamber is caused by the high temperature which a gas achieves ie the air when greatly compressed adiabatic compression diesel engines work by compressing only the air this increases the air temperature inside the cylinder to such a high degree that it ignites atomised diesel fuel that is injected into the combustion chamber this contrasts with spark-ignition engines such as a petrol engine gasoline engine or gas engine using a gaseous fuel as opposed to petrol which use a spark plug to ignite an air-fuel mixture in compression-ignition engines glow plugs combustion chamber pre-warmers may be used to aid starting in cold weather or when the engine uses a lower compression-ratio or both the original compression-ignition engine operates on the constant pressure cycle of gradual combustion and produces no audible knock the compression-ignition engine has the highest thermal efficiency engine efficiency of any practical internal or external combustion engine due to its very high expansion ratio and inherent lean burn which enables heat dissipation by the excess air a small efficiency loss is also avoided compared to two-stroke non-direct-injection gasoline engines since unburnt fuel is not present at valve overlap and therefore no fuel goes directly from the intakeinjection to the exhaust low-speed compression-ignition engines as used in ships and other applications where overall engine weight is relatively unimportant can have a thermal efficiency that exceeds 50 1 2 compression-ignition engines are manufactured in two-stroke and four-stroke versions they were originally used as a more efficient replacement for stationary steam engines since the 1910s they have been used in submarines and ships use in locomotives trucks heavy equipment and electricity generation plants followed later in the 1930s they slowly began to be used in a few automobiles since the 1970s the use of compression-ignition engines in larger on-road and off-road vehicles in the us increased according to the british society of motor manufacturing and traders the eu average for compression-ignition cars accounts for 50 of the total sold including 70 in france and 38 in the uk 3 the worlds largest compression-ignition engine is currently a wärtsilä-sulzer rta96-c common rail marine compression-ignition which produces a peak power output of 84.42mw  113,210hp at 102rpm 4 5

of a diesel engine to many has become an engine that uses compression ignition to some it may be an engine that uses heavy fuel oil to others an engine that does not use spark ignition however the original cycle proposed by rudolph diesel in 1892 was a constant temperature cycle a cycle based on the carnot theory which would require much higher compression than what is needed for compression ignition diesels idea was to compress the air so tightly that the temperature of the air would exceed that of combustion in his 1892 us patent granted in 1895 #542846 diesel describes the compression required for his cycle in later years diesel realized his original cycle would not work and he adopted the constant pressure cycle diesel describes the cycle in his 1885 patent application notice that there is no longer a mention of compression temperatures exceeding the temperature of combustion now all that is mentioned is the compression must be high enough for ignition history shows that the invention of the diesel engine was not based solely on one mans idea but it was the culmination of many different ideas that would be developed over time in 1806 claude and nicéphore niépce brothers developed the first known internal combustion engine and the first fuel injection system the pyréolophore fuel system used a blast of air provided by a bellows to atomize lycopodium a highly combustible fuel made from broad moss later coal dust mixed with resin became the fuel finally in 1816 they experimented with alcohol and white oil of petroleum a fuel similar to kerosene they discovered that the kerosene type fuel could be finely vaporized by passing it through a reed type device this made the fuel highly combustible in 1874 george brayton developed and patented a 2 stroke oil fueled constant pressure engine the ready motor this engine used a metered pump to supply fuel to an injection device in which the oil was vaporize by air and burned as it entered the cylinder 10 these were some of the first practical internal combustion engines to supply motive power braytons engines were installed in several boats a rail car 2 submarines and a bus 11 early diesel engines use a similar cycle 12 13 throughout the 1880s brayton continued trying to improve his engines in 1887 brayton developed and patented a 4 stroke direct injection oil engine us patent #432,114 of 1890 application filed in 1887 the fuel system used a variable quantity pump and liquid fuel high pressure spray type injection the liquid was forced through a spring loaded relief type valve injector which caused the fuel to become divided into small droplets vaporized injection was timed to occur at or near the peak of the compression stroke a platinum igniter or ignitor provided the source of ignition brayton describes the invention as follows i have discovered that heavy oils can be mechanically converted into a finely-divided condition within a firing portion of the cylinder or in a communicating firing chamber another part reads i have for the first time so far as my knowledge extends regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely-divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion this was likely the first engine to use a lean burn system to regulate engine speed  output in this manner the engine fired on every power stroke and speed  output was controlled solely by the quantity of fuel injected in 1890 brayton developed and patented a 4 stroke air blast oil engine us patent #432,260 14 the fuel system delivered a variable quantity of vaporized fuel to the center of the cylinder under pressure at or near the peak of the compression stroke the ignition source was an igniter made from platinum wire a variable quantity injection pump provided the fuel to an injector where it was mixed with air as it entered the cylinder a small crank driven compressor provided the source for air this engine also used the lean burn system 15 brayton died in 1893 but would be credited with the invention of the constant pressure brayton cycle in 1885 the english inventor herbert akroyd stuart began investigating the possibility of using paraffin oil very similar to modern-day diesel for an engine which unlike petrol would be difficult to vaporise in a carburettor as its volatility is not sufficient to allow this 16 17 the hot bulb engines first prototyped in 1886 and built from 1891 by richard hornsby and sons used a pressurized fuel injection system 18 the hornsby-akroyd oil engine engine used a comparatively low compression ratio so that the temperature of the air compressed in the combustion chamber at the end of the compression stroke was not high enough to initiate combustion combustion instead took place in a separated combustion chamber the vaporizer or hot bulb mounted on the cylinder head into which fuel was sprayed self-ignition occurred from contact between the fuel-air mixture and the hot walls of the vaporizer 19 as the engines load increased so did the temperature of the bulb causing the ignition period to advance to counteract pre-ignition water was dripped into the air intake 20 in 1892 akroyd stuart patented a water-jacketed vaporiser to allow compression ratios to be increased in the same year thomas henry barton at hornsbys built a working high-compression version for experimental purposes whereby the vaporiser was replaced with a cylinder head therefore not relying on air being preheated but by combustion through higher compression ratios it ran for six hoursthe first time automatic ignition was produced by compression alonetemplateno reference or citation provided this was five years before rudolf diesel built his well-known high-compression prototype engine in 1897 21 herbert akroyd stuart was a pioneer in developing compression ignition rudolf diesel however was subsequently credited with the compression ignition engine innovation higher compression and thermal efficiency is what distinguishes diesels patent of 3,500 kilopascals  508 psi in 1892 diesel received patents in germany switzerland the united kingdom and the united states for method of and apparatus for converting heat into work 22 in 1893 he described a slow-combustion engine that first compressed air thereby raising its temperature above the igniting-point of the fuel then gradually introducing fuel while letting the mixture expand against resistance sufficiently to prevent an essential increase of temperature and pressure then cutting off fuel and expanding without transfer of heatcitation needed in 1894 and 1895 he filed patents and addenda in various countries for his diesel engine the first patents were issued in spain no 16,654 france no 243,531 and belgium no 113,139 in december 1894 and in germany no 86,633 in 1895 and the united states no 608,845 in 1898 23 he operated his first successful engine in 1897 24 on february 17 1894 the redesigned engine ran for 88 revolutions - one minute with this news maschinefabrik augsburgs stock rose by 30 indicative of the tremendous anticipated demands for a more efficient engine in 1896 rudolphs rushed to have a prototype running in order to maintain the patent the first engine ready for testing was built on december 31 1896 a much different engine than the one they had started with in 1897 between deal signing and brainstorming episodes they succeed the engine runs 16.93kw with an efficiency of 16.6 he is granted the patent by 1898 diesel had become a millionaire his engines were used to power pipelines electric and water plants automobiles and trucks and marine craft they were soon to be used in mines oil fields

injection on its new range of microvans 60 2012 common rail systems working with pressures of 2,500 bar launched 61 62 operating principleedit the diesel internal combustion engine differs from the gasoline powered otto cycle by using highly compressed hot air to ignite the fuel rather than using a spark plug compression ignition rather than spark ignition in the true diesel engine only air is initially introduced into the combustion chamber the air is then compressed with a compression ratio typically between 15:1 and 23:1 this high compression causes the temperature of the air to rise at about the top of the compression stroke fuel is injected directly into the compressed air in the combustion chamber this may be into a typically toroidal void in the top of the piston or a pre-chamber depending upon the design of the engine the fuel injector ensures that the fuel is broken down into small droplets and that the fuel is distributed evenly the heat of the compressed air vaporizes fuel from the surface of the droplets the vapour is then ignited by the heat from the compressed air in the combustion chamber the droplets continue to vaporise from their surfaces and burn getting smaller until all the fuel in the droplets has been burnt combustion occurs at a substantially constant pressure during the initial part of the power stroke the start of vaporisation causes a delay before ignition and the characteristic diesel knocking sound as the vapour reaches ignition temperature and causes an abrupt increase in pressure above the piston not shown on the p-v indicator diagram when combustion is complete the combustion gases expand as the piston descends further the high pressure in the cylinder drives the piston downward supplying power to the crankshaft 63 as well as the high level of compression allowing combustion to take place without a separate ignition system a high compression ratio greatly increases the engines efficiency increasing the compression ratio in a spark-ignition engine where fuel and air are mixed before entry to the cylinder is limited by the need to prevent damaging pre-ignition since only air is compressed in a diesel engine and fuel is not introduced into the cylinder until shortly before top dead centre tdc premature detonation is not a problem and compression ratios are much higher the pv diagam is a simplified and idealised representation of the events involved in a diesel engine cycle arranged to illustrate the similarity with a carnot cycle starting at 1 the piston is at bottom dead centre and both valves are closed at the start of the compression stroke the cylinder contains air at atmospheric pressure between 1 and 2 the air is compressed adiabaticallythat is without heat transfer to or from the environmentby the rising piston this is only approximately true since there will be some heat exchange with the cylinder walls during this compression the volume is reduced the pressure and temperature both rise at or slightly before 2 tdc fuel is injected and burns in the compressed hot air chemical energy is released and this constitutes an injection of thermal energy heat into the compressed gas combustion and heating occur between 2 and 3 in this interval the pressure remains constant since the piston descends and the volume increases the temperature rises as a consequence of the energy of combustion at 3 fuel injection and combustion are complete and the cylinder contains gas at a higher temperature than at 2 between 3 and 4 this hot gas expands again approximately adiabatically work is done on the system to which the engine is connected during this expansion phase the volume of the gas rises and its temperature and pressure both fall at 4 the exhaust valve opens and the pressure falls abruptly to atmospheric approximately this is unresisted expansion and no useful work is done by it ideally the adiabatic expansion should continue extending the line 3–4 to the right until the pressure falls to that of the surrounding air but the loss of efficiency caused by this unresisted expansion is justified by the practical difficulties involved in recovering it the engine would have to be much larger after the opening of the exhaust valve the exhaust stroke follows but this and the following induction stroke are not shown on the diagram if shown they would be represented by a low-pressure loop at the bottom of the diagram at 1 it is assumed that the exhaust and induction strokes have been completed and the cylinder is again filled with air the piston-cylinder system absorbs energy between 1 and 2this is the work needed to compress the air in the cylinder and is provided by mechanical kinetic energy stored in the flywheel of the engine work output is done by the piston-cylinder combination between 2 and 4 the difference between these two increments of work is the indicated work output per cycle and is represented by the area enclosed by the pv loop the adiabatic expansion is in a higher pressure range than that of the compression because the gas in the cylinder is hotter during expansion than during compression it is for this reason that the loop has a finite area and the net output of work during a cycle is positive major advantagesedit diesel engines have several advantages over other internal combustion engines they burn less fuel than a petrol engine performing the same work due to the engines higher temperature of combustion and greater expansion ratio 1 gasoline engines are typically 30 efficient while diesel engines can convert over 45 of the fuel energy into mechanical energy see carnot cycle for further explanation 64 they have no high voltage electrical ignition system resulting in high reliability and easy adaptation to damp environments the absence of coils spark plug wires etc also eliminates a source of radio frequency emissions which can interfere with navigation and communication equipment which is especially important in marine and aircraft applications and for preventing interference with radio telescopes the longevity of a diesel engine is generally about twice that of a petrol engine due to the increased strength of parts used 65 66 diesel fuel has better lubrication properties than petrol as well indeed in unit injectors the fuel is employed for three distinct purposes injector lubrication injector cooling and injection for combustion bus powered by biodiesel diesel fuel is distilled directly from petroleum distillation yields some gasoline but the yield would be inadequate without catalytic reforming which is a more costly process although diesel fuel will burn in open air using a wick it does not release a large amount of flammable vapor which could lead to an explosion the low vapor pressure of diesel is especially advantageous in marine applications where the accumulation of explosive fuel-air mixtures is a particular hazard for the same reason diesel engines are immune to vapor lock for any given partial load the fuel efficiency mass burned per energy produced of a diesel engine remains nearly constant as opposed to petrol and turbine engines which use proportionally more fuel with partial power outputs 67 68 69 they generate less waste heat in cooling and exhaust 1 diesel engines can accept super- or turbo-charging pressure without any natural limit constrained only by the strength of engine components this is unlike petrol engines which inevitably suffer detonation at higher pressure the carbon monoxide content of the exhaust is minimal 70 biodiesel is an easily synthesized non-petroleum-based fuel through transesterification which can run directly in many diesel engines while gasoline engines either need adaptation to run synthetic fuels or else use them as an additive to gasoline eg ethanol added to gasohol  early fuel injection systemsedit diesels original engine injected fuel with the assistance of compressed air which atomized the fuel and forced it into the engine through a nozzle a similar principle to an aerosol spray the nozzle opening was closed by a pin valve lifted by the camshaft to initiate the fuel injection before top dead centre tdc this is called an air-blast injection driving the compressor used some power but the efficiency and net power output was more than any other combustion engine at that time 71 diesel engines in service today raise the fuel to extreme pressures by mechanical pumps and deliver it to the combustion chamber by pressure-activated injectors without compressed air with direct injected diesels injectors spray fuel through 4 to 12 small orifices in its nozzle the early air injection diesels always had a superior combustion without the sharp increase in pressure during combustion research is now being performed and patents are being taken out to again use some form of air injection to reduce the nitrogen oxides and pollution reverting to diesels original implementation with its superior combustion and possibly quieter operation in all major aspects the modern diesel engine holds true to rudolf diesels original design that of igniting fuel by compression at an extremely high pressure within the cylinder with much higher pressures and high technology injectors present-day diesel engines use the so-called solid injection system applied by herbert akroyd stuart for his hot bulb engine the indirect injection engine could be considered the latest development of these low speed hot bulb ignition engines fuel deliveryedit over the years many different injection methods have been used these can be described as air blast where the fuel is blown into the cylinder by a blast of air solid fuel  hydraulic injection where the fuel is pushed through a spring loaded valve  injector to produce a combustable mist mechanical unit injector where the injector is directly operated by a cam and fuel quantity is controlled by a rack or lever  mechanical electronic unit injector where the injector is operated by a cam and fuel quantity is controlled electronically common rail mechanical injection fuel is at high pressure in a common rail and controlled by mechanical means common rail electronic injection fuel is at high pressure in a common rail and controlled electronically diesel engines are also produced with two significantly different injection locations direct and indirect indirect injected engines place the injector in a pre-combustion chamber in the head which due to thermal losses generally require a glow plug to start and very high compression ratio usually in the range of 21:1 to 23:1 ratio direct injected engines use a generally donut shaped combustion chamber void on the top of the piston thermal efficiency losses are significantly lower in di engines which facilitates a much lower compression ratio generally between 14:1 and 20:1 but most di engines are closer to 17:1 the direct injected process is significantly more internally violent and thus requires careful design and more robust construction the lower compression ratio also creates challenges for emissions due to partial burn turbocharging is particularly suited to di engines since the low compression ratio facilitates meaningful forced induction and the increase in airflow allows capturing additional fuel efficiency not only from more complete combustion but also from lowering parasitic efficiency losses when properly operated by widening both power and efficiency curves the violent combustion process of direct injection also creates more noise but modern designs using split shot injectors or similar multi shot processes have dramatically amended this issue by firing a small charge of fuel before the main delivery which pre-charges the combustion chamber for a less abrupt and in most cases slightly cleaner burncitation needed a vital component of all diesel engines is a mechanical or electronic governor which regulates the idling speed and maximum speed of the engine by controlling the rate of fuel delivery unlike otto-cycle engines incoming air is not throttled and a diesel engine without a governor cannot have a stable idling speed and can easily overspeed resulting in its destruction mechanically governed fuel injection systems are driven by the engines gear train 72 these systems use a combination of springs and weights to control fuel delivery relative to both load and speed 72 modern electronically controlled diesel engines control fuel delivery by use of an electronic control module ecm or electronic control unit ecu the ecmecu receives an engine speed signal as well as other operating parameters such as intake manifold pressure and fuel temperature from a sensor and controls the amount of fuel and start of injection timing through actuators to maximise power and efficiency and minimise emissions controlling the timing of the start of injection of fuel into the cylinder is a key to minimizing emissions and maximizing fuel economy efficiency of the engine the timing is measured in degrees of crank angle of the piston before top dead centre for example if the ecmecu initiates fuel injection when the piston is 10 before tdc the start of injection or timing is said to be 10 btdc optimal timing will depend on the engine design as well as its speed and load and is usually 4 btdc in 1,350–6,000 hp net medium speed locomotive marine and stationary diesel engines advancing the start of injection injecting before the piston reaches to its soi-tdc results in higher in-cylinder pressure and temperature and higher efficiency but also results in increased engine noise due to faster cylinder pressure rise and increased oxides of nitrogen nox formation due to higher combustion temperatures delaying start of injection causes incomplete combustion reduced fuel efficiency and an increase in exhaust smoke containing a considerable amount of particulate matter and unburned hydrocarbons citation needed mechanical and electronic injectionedit many configurations of fuel injection have been used over the course of the 20th century most present-day diesel engines use a mechanical single plunger high-pressure fuel pump driven by the engine crankshaft for each engine cylinder the corresponding plunger in the fuel pump measures out the correct amount of fuel and determines the timing of each injection these engines use injectors that are very precise spring-loaded valves that open and close at a specific fuel pressure separate high-pressure fuel lines connect the fuel pump with each cylinder fuel volume for each single combustion is controlled by a slanted groove in the plunger which rotates only a few degrees releasing the pressure and is controlled by a mechanical governor consisting of weights rotating at engine speed constrained by springs and a lever the injectors are held open by the fuel pressure on high-speed engines the plunger pumps are together in one unit 73 the length of fuel lines from the pump to each injector is normally the same for each cylinder in order to obtain the same pressure delay a cheaper configuration on high-speed engines with fewer than six cylinders is to use an axial-piston distributor pump consisting of one rotating pump plunger delivering fuel to a valve and line for each cylinder functionally analogous to points and distributor cap on an otto engine 72 many modern systems have a single fuel pump which supplies fuel constantly at high pressure with a common rail single fuel line common to each injector each injector has a solenoid operated by an electronic control unit resulting in more accurate control of injector opening times that depend on other control conditions such as engine speed and loading and providing better engine performance and fuel economycitation needed both mechanical and electronic injection systems can be used in either direct or indirect injection configurationscitation needed two-stroke diesel engines with mechanical injection pumps can be inadvertently run in reverse albeit in a very inefficient manner possibly damaging the engine 74 large ship two-stroke diesels are designed to run in either direction obviating the need for a gearboxcitation needed indirect injectionedit an indirect diesel injection system idi engine delivers fuel into a small chamber called a swirl chamber pre combustion chamber pre chamber or ante-chamber which is connected to the cylinder by a narrow air passage generally the goal of the pre camber is to create increased turbulence for better air  fuel mixing this system also allows for a smoother quieter running engine and because fuel mixing is assisted by turbulence injector pressures can be lower most idi systems tend to use a single orifice injector the pre-chamber has the disadvantage of lowering efficiency due to increased heat loss to the engines cooling system restricting the combustion burn thus reducing the efficiency by 5–10 idi engines are also more difficult to start and usually require the use of glow plugs idi engines may be cheaper to build but generally require a higher compression ratio than the di counterpart idi also makes it easier to produce smooth quieter running engines with a simple mechanical injection system since exact injection timing is not as critical most modern automotive engines are di which have the benefits of greater efficiency easier starting however idi engines can still be found in the many atv and small diesel applications 75 direct injectionedit direct injection diesel engines inject fuel directly into the cylinder usually there is a combustion cup in the top of the piston where the fuel is sprayed many different methods of injection can be used electronic control of the fuel injection transformed the direct injection engine by allowing much greater control over the combustion 76 unit direct injectionedit unit direct injection also injects fuel directly into the cylinder of the engine in this system the injector and the pump are combined into one unit positioned over each cylinder controlled by the camshaft each cylinder has its own unit eliminating the high-pressure fuel lines achieving a more consistent injection this type of injection system also developed by bosch is used by volkswagen ag in cars where it is called a pumpe-düse-systemliterally pump-nozzle system and by mercedes-benz pld and most major diesel engine manufacturers in large commercial engines man se cat cummins detroit diesel electro-motive diesel volvo with recent advancements the pump pressure has been raised to 2,400 bars  240mpa 35,000psi 77 allowing injection parameters similar to common rail systems 78 common rail direct injectionedit common rail injection was first used in production by atlas imperial diesel in the 1920s the rail pressure was kept at a steady 2,000 - 4,000 psi in the injectors a needle was mechanically lifted off of the seat to create the injection event 79 modern common rail systems use very high-pressures in these systems an engine driven pump pressurizes fuel at up to 2,500bar  250mpa 36,000psi 80not in citation given in a common rail the common rail is a tube that supplies each computer-controlled injector containing a precision-machined nozzle and a plunger driven by a solenoid or piezoelectric actuator cold weather problemsedit startingedit in cold weather high speed diesel engines can be difficult to start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression preventing ignition due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio pre-chambered engines make use of small electric heaters inside the pre-chambers called glowplugs while direct-injected engines have these glowplugs in the combustion chambercitation needed many engines use resistive heaters in the intake manifold to warm the inlet air for starting or until the engine reaches operating temperature engine block heaters electric resistive heaters in the engine block connected to the utility grid are used in cold climates when an engine is turned off for extended periods more than an hour to reduce startup time and engine wear block heaters are also used for emergency power standby diesel-powered generators which must rapidly pick up load on a power failure in the past a wider variety of cold-start methods were used some engines such as detroit diesel 81 engines usedwhen a system to introduce small amounts of ether into the inlet manifold to start combustion others used a mixed system with a resistive heater burning methanol an impromptu method particularly on out-of-tune engines is to manually spray an aerosol can of ether-based engine starter fluid into the intake air stream usually through the intake air filter assembly gellingedit diesel fuel is also prone to waxing or gelling in cold weather both are terms for the solidification of diesel oil into a partially crystalline state the crystals build up in the fuel line especially in fuel filters eventually starving the engine of fuel and causing it to stop running low-output electric heaters in fuel tanks and around fuel lines are used to solve this problem also most engines have a spill return system by which any excess fuel from the injector pump and injectors is returned to the fuel tank once the engine has warmed returning warm fuel prevents waxing in the tank due to improvements in fuel technology with additives waxing rarely occurs in all but the coldest weather when a mix of diesel and kerosene may be used to run a vehicle gas stations in regions with a cold climate are required to offer winterized diesel in the cold seasons that allow operation below a specific cold filter plugging point in europe these diesel characteristics are described in the en 590 standard supercharging and turbochargingedit many diesels are now turbocharged and some are both turbo charged and supercharged a turbocharged engine can produce more power than a naturally aspirated engine of the same configuration a supercharger is powered mechanically by the engines crankshaft while a turbocharger is powered by the engine exhaust turbocharging can improve the fuel economy 82 of diesel engines by recovering waste heat from the exhaust increasing the excess air factor and increasing the ratio of engine output to friction losses a two-stroke engine does not have a discrete exhaust and intake stroke and thus is incapable of self-aspiration therefore all two-stroke engines must be fitted with a blower or some form of compressor to charge the cylinders with air and assist in dispersing exhaust gases a process referred to as scavenging in some cases the engine may also be fitted with a turbocharger whose output is directed into the blower inlet a few designs employ a hybrid blower  turbocharger a turbo-compressor system for scavenging and charging the cylinders which device is mechanically driven at cranking and low speeds to act as a blower but which acts as a true turbocharger at higher speeds and loads a hybrid turbocharger can revert to compressor mode during commands for large increases in engine output power as turbocharged or supercharged engines produce more power for a given engine size as compared to naturally aspirated engines attention must be paid to the mechanical design of components lubrication and cooling to handle the power pistons are usually cooled with lubrication oil sprayed on the bottom of the piston large low speed engines may use water sea water or oil supplied through telescoping pipes attached to the crosshead to cool the pistons 83 typesedit size groupsedit there are three size groups of diesel engines 84 smallunder 188kw  252hp output medium large basic typesedit there are two basic types of diesel engines 84 four stroke cycle two stroke cycle early enginesedit in 1897 when the first diesel engine was completed adolphus busch traveled to cologne and negotiated exclusive right to produce the diesel engine in the us and canada in his examination of the engine it was noted that the diesel at that time operated at thermodynamic efficiencies of 27 while a typical expansion steam engine would operate at about 7-10 85 in the early decades of the 20th century when large diesel engines were first being used the engines took a form similar to the compound steam engines common at the time with the piston being connected to the connecting rod by a crosshead bearing following steam engine practice some manufacturers made double-acting two-stroke and four-stroke diesel engines to increase power output with combustion taking place on both sides of the piston with two sets of valve gear and fuel injection while it produced large amounts of power the double-acting diesel engines main problem was producing a good seal where the piston rod passed through the bottom of the lower combustion chamber to the crosshead bearing and no more were built by the 1930s turbochargers were fitted to some engines crosshead bearings are still used to reduce the wear on the cylinders in large long-stroke main marine engines modern high and medium-speed enginesedit as with petrol engines there are two classes of diesel engines in current use two-stroke and four-stroke the four-stroke type is the classic version tracing its lineage back to rudolf diesels prototype it is also the most commonly used form being the preferred power source for many motor vehicles especially buses and trucks much larger engines such as used for railroad locomotion and marine propulsion are often two-stroke units offering a more favourable power-to-weight ratio as well as better fuel economy the most powerful engines in the world are two-stroke diesels of mammoth dimensions 86 two-stroke diesel engine operation is similar to that of petrol counterparts except that fuel is not mixed with air before induction and the crankcase does not take an active role in the cycle the traditional two-stroke design relies upon a mechanically driven positive displacement blower to charge the cylinders with air before compression and ignition the charging process also assists in expelling scavenging combustion gases remaining from the previous power stroke the archetype of the modern form of the two-stroke diesel is the high-speed detroit diesel series 71 engine designed by charles f boss kettering and his colleagues at general motors corporation in 1938 in which the blower pressurizes a chamber in the engine block that is often referred to as the air box the very much larger medium-speed electro-motive diesel engine 87 is used as the prime mover in emd diesel-electric locomotive marine and stationary applications and was designed by the same team and is built to the same principle however a significant improvement built into most later emd engines is the mechanically assisted turbo-compressor which provides charge air using mechanical assistance during starting thereby obviating the necessity for roots-blown scavenging and provides charge air using an exhaust gas-driven turbine during normal operationsthereby providing true turbocharging and additionally increasing the engines power output by at least fifty percenta in a two-stroke diesel engine as the cylinders piston approaches the bottom dead centre exhaust ports or valves are opened relieving most of the excess pressure after which a passage between the air box and the cylinder is opened permitting air flow into the cylinder 88 the air flow blows the remaining combustion gases from the cylinderthis is the scavenging process as the piston passes through bottom centre and starts upward the passage is closed and compression commences 89 culminating in fuel injection and ignition 90 refer to two-stroke diesel engines for more detailed coverage of aspiration types and supercharging of two-stroke diesel engines normally the number of cylinders are used in multiples of two although any number of cylinders can be used as long as the load on the crankshaft is counterbalanced to prevent excessive vibration the inline-six-cylinder design is the most prolific in light- to medium-duty engines though small v8 and larger inline-four displacement engines are also common small-capacity engines generally considered to be those below five litres in capacity are generally four- or six-cylinder types with the four-cylinder being the most common type found in automotive uses five-cylinder diesel engines have also been produced being a compromise between the smooth running of the six-cylinder and the space-efficient dimensions of the four-cylinder diesel engines for smaller plant machinery boats tractors generators and pumps may be four three or two-cylinder types with the single-cylinder diesel engine remaining for light stationary work direct reversible two-stroke marine diesels need at least three cylinders for reliable restarting forwards and reverse while four-stroke diesels need at least six cylinders the desire to improve the diesel engines power-to-weight ratio produced several novel cylinder arrangements to extract more power from a given capacity the uniflow opposed-piston engine uses two pistons in one cylinder with the combustion cavity in the middle and gas in- and outlets at the ends this makes a comparatively light powerful swiftly running and economic engine suitable for use in aviation an example is the junkers jumo 204/205 the napier deltic engine with three cylinders arranged in a triangular formation each containing two opposed pistons the whole engine having three crankshafts is one of the better known gas generatoredit before 1950 sulzer started experimenting with two-stroke engines with boost pressures as high as 6 atmospheres in which all the output power was taken from an exhaust gas turbine the two-stroke pistons directly drove air compressor pistons to make a positive displacement gas generator opposed pistons were connected by linkages instead of crankshafts several of these units could be connected to provide power gas to one large output turbine the overall thermal efficiency was roughly twice that of a simple gas turbine 91 this system was derived from raúl pateras pescaras work on free-piston engines in the 1930s advantages and disadvantages versus spark-ignition enginesedit fuel economyedit the man s80me-c7 low speed diesel engines use 155 grams  5.5oz of fuel per kwh for an overall energy conversion efficiency of 54.4 which is the highest conversion of fuel into power by any single-cycle internal or external combustion engine 1 the efficiency of a combined cycle gas turbine system can exceed 60 92 diesel engines are more efficient than gasoline petrol engines of the same power rating resulting in lower fuel consumption a common margin is 40 more miles per gallon for an efficient turbodiesel for example the current model škoda octavia using volkswagen group engines has a combined euro rating of 6.2l/100km  46mpg-imp 38mpg-us for the 102bhp  76kw petrol engine and 4.4l/100km  64mpg-imp 53mpg-us for the 105bhp  78kw diesel engine however such a comparison does not take into account that diesel fuel is denser and contains about 15 more energy by volume although the calorific value of the fuel is slightly lower at 45.3mjkg megajoules per kilogram than petrol at 45.8mjkg liquid diesel fuel is significantly denser than liquid petrol this is significant because volume of fuel in addition to mass is an important consideration in mobile applications adjusting the numbers to account for the energy density of diesel fuel the overall energy efficiency is still about 20 greater for the diesel version while a higher compression ratio is helpful in raising efficiency diesel engines are much more efficient than gasoline petrol engines when at low power and at engine idle unlike the petrol engine diesels lack a butterfly valve throttle in the inlet system which closes at idle this creates parasitic loss and destruction of availability of the incoming air reducing the efficiency of petrol engines at idle in many applications such as marine agriculture and railways diesels are left idling and unattended for many hours sometimes even days these advantages are especially attractive in locomotives see dieselisation even though diesel engines have a theoretical fuel efficiency of 75citation needed in practice it is lower engines in large diesel trucks buses and newer diesel cars can achieve peak efficiencies around 45 93 and could reach 55 efficiency in the near future 94 however average efficiency over a driving cycle is lower than peak efficiency for example it might be 37 for an engine with a peak efficiency of 44 95 torqueedit diesel engines produce more torque than petrol engines for a given displacement due to their higher compression ratio higher pressure in the cylinder and higher forces on the connecting rods and crankshaft require stronger heavier components heavier rotating components prevent diesel engines from revving as high as petrol engines for a given displacement diesel engines generally have similar power and inferior power to weight ratios as compared to petrol engines petrol engines must be geared lower to get the same torque as a comparable diesel but since petrol engines rev higher both will have similar acceleration an arbitrary amount of torque at the wheels can be gained by gearing any power source down sufficiently including a hand crank for example a theoretical engine with a constant 200ftlbs of torque and a 3000 rpm rev limit has just as much power a little over 114hp as another theoretical engine with a constant maximum 100ftlbs of torque and a 6000 rpm rev limit a lossless 2 to 1 reduction gear on the second engine will output a constant maximum 200ftlbs of torque at a maximum of 3000 rpm with no change in power comparing engines based on maximum torque is just as useful as comparing them based on maximum rpm poweredit conditions in the diesel engine differ from the spark-ignition engine due to the different thermodynamic cycle in addition the power and engine speed are directly controlled by the fuel supply rather than by controlling the air supply as in an otto cycle engine the average diesel engine has a poorer power-to-weight ratio than the petrol engine this is because the diesel must operate at lower engine speeds due to the need for heavier stronger parts to resist the operating pressure caused by the high compression ratio of the engine which increases the forces on the parts due to inertial forces 96 in addition diesels are often built with stronger parts to give them longer lives and better reliability important considerations in industrial applicationstemplatequestionable diesel engines usually have longer stroke lengths chiefly to facilitate achieving the necessary compression ratios as a result piston and connecting rods are heavier and more force must be transmitted through the connecting rods and crankshaft to change the momentum of the piston this is another reason that a diesel engine must be stronger for the same power output as a petrol engine yet it is this characteristic that has allowed some enthusiasts to acquire significant power increases with turbocharged engines by making fairly simple and inexpensive modifications a petrol engine of similar size cannot put out a comparable power increase without extensive alterations because the stock components cannot withstand the higher stresses placed upon them since a diesel engine is already built to withstand higher levels of stress it makes an ideal candidate for performance tuning at little expense however it should be said that any modification that raises the amount of fuel and air put through a diesel engine will increase its operating temperature which will reduce its life and increase service requirements these are issues with newer lighter high-performance diesel engines which are not overbuilt to the degree of older engines and they are being pushed to provide greater power in smaller enginescitation needed emissionsedit since the diesel engine uses less fuel than the petrol engine per unit distance the diesel produces less carbon dioxide co2 per unit distance recent advances in production and changes in the political climate have increased the availability and awareness of biodiesel an alternative to petroleum-derived diesel fuel with a much lower net-sum emission of co2 due to the absorption of co2 by plants used to produce the fuel however the use of waste vegetable oil sawmill waste from managed forests in finland and advances in the production of vegetable oil from algae demonstrate great promise in providing feed stocks for sustainable biodiesel that are not in competition with food production when a diesel engine runs at low power there is enough oxygen present to burn the fueldiesel engines only make significant amounts of carbon monoxide when running under a loadcitation needed diesel fuel is injected just before the power stroke as a result the fuel cannot burn completely unless it has a sufficient amount of oxygen this can result in incomplete combustion and black smoke in the exhaust if more fuel is injected than there is air available for the combustion process modern engines with electronic fuel delivery can adjust the timing and amount of fuel delivered and so operate with less waste of fuel in a mechanical system fuel timing system the injection and duration must be set to be efficient at the anticipated operating rpm and load and so the settings are less than ideal when the engine is running at any other rpm the electronic injection can sense engine revs load even boost and temperature and continuously alter the timing to match the given situation in the petrol engine air and fuel are mixed for the entire compression stroke ensuring complete mixing even at higher engine speeds diesel exhaust is well known for its characteristic smell but this smell in recent years has become much less due to use of low sulfur fuel diesel exhaust has been found to contain a long list of toxic air contaminants among these pollutants fine particle pollution is an important as a cause of diesels harmful health effects however when diesel engines burn their fuel with high oxygen levels this results in high combustion temperatures and higher efficiency and these particles tend to burn but the amount of nox pollution tends to increase nox pollution can be reduced with diesel exhaust fluid which is injected into the exhaust stream and catalytically destroys the nox chemical species exhaust gas recirculation which works by recirculating a portion of an engines exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders also has very positive effects on nox emissions noiseedit the distinctive noise of a diesel engine is variably called diesel clatter diesel nailing or diesel knock 97 diesel clatter is caused largely by the diesel combustion process the sudden ignition of the diesel fuel when injected into the combustion chamber causes a pressure wave engine designers can reduce diesel clatter through indirect injection pilot or pre-injection injection timing injection rate compression ratio turbo boost and exhaust gas recirculation egr 98 common rail diesel injection systems permit multiple injection events as an aid to noise reduction diesel fuels with a higher octane rating modify the combustion process and reduce diesel clatter 97 cn cetane number can be raised by distilling higher quality crude oil by catalyzing a higher quality product or by using a cetane improving additivecitation needed a combination of improved mechanical technology such as multi-stage injectors which fire a short pilot charge of fuel into the cylinder to initiate combustion before delivering the main fuel charge higher injection pressures that have improved the atomisation of fuel into smaller droplets and electronic control which can adjust the timing and length of the injection process to optimise it for all speeds and temperatures have partially mitigated these problems in the latest generation of common-rail designs while improving engine efficiencycitation needed reliabilityedit for most industrial or nautical applications reliability is considered more important than light weight and high power the lack of an electrical ignition system greatly improves the reliability the high durability of a diesel engine is also due to its overbuilt nature see above diesel fuel is a better lubricant than petrol and thus it is less harmful to the oil film on piston rings and cylinder bores as occurs in petro powered engines it is routine for diesel engines to cover 400,000km  250,000mi or more without a rebuild due to the greater compression ratio and the increased weight of the stronger components starting a diesel engine is harder than starting a gasoline engine of similar design and displacement more torque from the starter motor is required to push the engine through the compression cycle when starting compared to a petrol engine this can cause difficulty when starting in winter time if using conventional automotive batteries because of the lower current available either an electrical starter or an air-start system is used to start the engine turning on large engines pre-lubrication and slow turning of an engine as well as heating are required to minimise the amount of engine damage during initial start-up and running some smaller military diesels can be started with an explosive cartridge called a coffman starter which provides the extra power required to get the machine turning in the past caterpillar and john deere used a small petrol pony engine in their tractors to start the primary diesel engine the pony engine heated the diesel to aid in ignition and used a small clutch and transmission to spin up the diesel engine even more unusual was an international harvester design in which the diesel engine had its own carburetor and ignition system and started on petrol once warmed the operator moved two levers to switch the engine to diesel operation and work could begin these engines had very complex cylinder heads with their own petrol combustion chambers and were vulnerable to expensive damage if special care was not taken especially in letting the engine cool before turning it offcitation needed cylinder cavitation and erosion damageedit one phenomenon that can affect water-cooled diesel engines is cylinder cavitation and erosion this is due to a phenomenon in high-compression engines where the ignition of the fuel in the cylinder causes a high-frequency vibration that causes bubbles to form in the coolant in contact with the cylinder when these tiny bubbles collapse coolant impacts the cylinder wall over time causing small holes to form in the cylinder wall 99 this damage is mitigated in some engines with coatings or with a coolant additive specifically designed to prevent cavitation and erosion damage engines damaged in this way will require the affected cylinder to be repaired where possible or will be rendered unusable quality and variety of fuelsedit petrolgasoline engines are limited in the variety and quality of the fuels they can burn older petrol engines fitted with a carburetor required a volatile fuel that would vaporise easily to create the necessary air-fuel ratio for combustion because both air and fuel are admitted to the cylinder if the compression ratio of the engine is too high or the fuel too volatile with too low an octane rating the fuel will ignite under compression as in a diesel engine before the piston reaches the top of its stroke this pre-ignition causes a power loss and over time major damage to the piston and cylinder the need for a fuel that is volatile enough to vaporise but not too volatile to avoid pre-ignition means that petrol engines will only run on a narrow range of fuels there has been some success at dual-fuel engines that use petrol and ethanol petrol and propane and petrol and methane in diesel engines a mechanical injector system vaporizes the fuel directly into the combustion chamber or a pre-combustion chamber as opposed to a venturi jet in a carburetor or a fuel injector in a fuel injection system vaporising fuel into the intake manifold or intake runners as in a petrol engine this forced vaporisation means that less-volatile fuels can be used more crucially because only air is inducted into the cylinder in a diesel engine the compression ratio can be much higher as there is no risk of pre-ignition provided the injection process is accurately timed this means that cylinder temperatures are much higher in a diesel engine than a petrol engine allowing less volatile fuels to be used diesel fuel is a form of light fuel oil very similar to kerosene paraffin but diesel engines especially older or simple designs that lack precision electronic injection systems can run on a wide variety of other fuels some of the most common alternatives are jet a-1 type jet fuel or vegetable oil from a very wide variety of plants some engines can be run on vegetable oil without modification and most others require fairly basic alterations biodiesel is a pure diesel-like fuel refined from vegetable oil and can be used in nearly all diesel engines requirements for fuels to be used in diesel engines are the ability of the fuel to flow along the fuel lines the ability of the fuel to lubricate the injector pump and injectors adequately and its ignition qualities ignition delay cetane number inline mechanical injector pumps generally tolerate poor-quality or bio-fuels better than distributor-type pumps also indirect injection engines generally run more satisfactorily on bio-fuels than direct injection engines this is partly because an indirect injection engine has a much greater swirl effect improving vaporisation and combustion of fuel and because in the case of vegetable oil-type fuels lipid depositions can condense on the cylinder walls of a direct-injection engine if combustion temperatures are too low such as starting the engine from cold it is often reported that diesel designed his engine to run on peanut oil but this is false patent number 608845 describes his engine as being designed to run on pulverulent solid fuel coal dust diesel stated in his published papers at the paris exhibition in 1900 exposition universelle there was shown by the otto company a small diesel engine which at the request of the french government ran on arachide earth-nut or peanut oil see biodiesel and worked so smoothly that only a few people were aware of it the engine was constructed for using mineral oil and was then worked on vegetable oil without any alterations being made the french government at the time thought of testing the applicability to power production of the arachide or earth-nut which grows in considerable quantities in their african colonies and can easily be cultivated there diesel himself later conducted related tests and appeared supportive of the idea 100 most large marine diesels run on heavy fuel oil sometimes called bunker oil which is a thick viscous and almost flameproof fuel which is very safe to store and cheap to buy in bulk as it is a waste product from the petroleum refining industry the fuel must not only be pre-heated but must be kept heated during handling and storage in order to maintain its pumpability this is usually accomplished by steam tracing on fuel lines and steam coils in fuel oil tanks the fuel is then preheated to over 100c before entering the engine in order to attain the proper viscosity for atomisation fuel and fluid characteristicsedit diesel engines can operate on a variety of different fuels depending on configuration though the eponymous diesel fuel derived from crude oil is most common the engines can work with the full spectrum of crude oil distillates from natural gas alcohols petrol wood gas to the fuel oils from diesel oil to residual fuels many automotive diesel engines would run on 100 biodiesel without any modifications the type of fuel used is selected to meet a combination of service requirements and fuel costs good-quality diesel fuel can be synthesised from vegetable oil and alcohol diesel fuel can be made from coal or other carbon base using the fischertropsch process biodiesel is growing in popularity since it can frequently be used in unmodified engines though production remains limited recently biodiesel from coconut which can produce a very promising coco methyl ester cme has characteristics which enhance lubricity and combustion giving a regular diesel engine without any modification more power less particulate matter or black smoke and smoother engine performance the philippines pioneers in the research on coconut based cme with the help of german and american scientists petroleum-derived diesel is often called petrodiesel if there is need to distinguish the source of the fuel pure plant oils are increasingly being used as a fuel for cars trucks and remote combined heat and power generation especially in germany where hundreds of decentralised small- and medium-sized oil presses cold press oilseed mainly rapeseed for fuel there is a deutsches institut für normung fuel standard for rapeseed oil fuel residual fuels are the dregs of the distillation process and are a thicker heavier oil or oil with higher viscosity which are so thick that they are not readily pumpable unless heated residual fuel oils are cheaper than clean refined diesel oil although they are dirtier their main considerations are for use in ships and very large generation sets due to the cost of the large volume of fuel consumed frequently amounting to many tonnes per hour the poorly refined biofuels straight vegetable oil svo and waste vegetable oil wvo can fall into this category but can be viable fuels on non-common rail or tdi pd diesels with the simple conversion of fuel heating to 80 to 100 degrees celsius to reduce viscosity and adequate filtration to oem standards engines using these heavy oils have to start and shut down on standard diesel fuel as these fuels will not flow through fuel lines at low temperatures moving beyond that use of low-grade fuels can lead to serious maintenance problems because of their high sulphur and lower lubrication properties most diesel engines that power ships like supertankers are built so that the engine can safely use low-grade fuels due to their separate cylinder and crankcase lubrication normal diesel fuel is more difficult to ignite and slower in developing fire than petrol because of its higher flash point but once burning a diesel fire can be fierce fuel contaminants such as dirt and water are often more problematic in diesel engines than in petrol engines water can cause serious damage due to corrosion to the injection pump and injectors and dirt even very fine particulate matter can damage the injection pumps due to the close tolerances that the pumps are machined to all diesel engines will have a fuel filter usually much finer than a filter on a petrol engine and a water trap the water trap which is sometimes part of the fuel filter often has a float connected to a warning light which warns when there is too much water in the trap and must be drained before damage to the engine can result the fuel filter must be replaced much more often on a diesel engine than on a petrol engine changing the fuel filter every 2–4 oil changes is not uncommon for some vehicles safetyedit fuel flammabilityedit diesel fuel is less flammable than petrol leading to a lower risk of fire caused by fuel in a vehicle equipped with a diesel engine in yachts diesel engines are often used because the petrol gasoline that fuels spark-ignition engines releases combustible vapors which can lead to an explosion if it accumulates in a confined space such as the bottom of a vessel ventilation systems are mandatory on petrol-powered vessels 101 the united states army and nato use only diesel engines and turbines because of fire hazard although neither gasoline nor diesel is explosive in liquid form both can create an explosive airvapor mix under the right conditions however diesel fuel is less prone due to its lower vapor pressure which is an indication of evaporation rate the material safety data sheet 102 for ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel indicates a vapor explosion hazard for diesel indoors outdoors or in sewers us army gasoline-engined tanks during world war ii were nicknamed ronsons because of their greater likelihood of catching fire when damaged by enemy fire although tank fires were usually caused by detonation of the ammunition rather than fuel while diesel tanks such as the soviet t-34 were less prone to catching fire maintenance hazardsedit fuel injection introduces potential hazards in engine maintenance due to the high fuel pressures used residual pressure can remain in the fuel lines long after an injection-equipped engine has been shut down this residual pressure must be relieved and if it is done so by external bleed-off the fuel must be safely contained if a high-pressure diesel fuel injector is removed from its seat and operated in open air there is a risk to the operator of injury by hypodermic jet-injection even with only 100 pounds per square inch  690kpa pressure 103 the first known such injury occurred in 1937 during a diesel engine maintenance operation 104 canceredit diesel exhaust has been classified as an iarc group 1 carcinogen it causes lung cancer and is associated with an increased risk for bladder cancer 105 applicationsedit the characteristics of diesel have different advantages for different applications passenger carsedit diesel engines have long been popular in bigger cars and have been used in smaller cars such as superminis in europe since the 1980s they were popular in larger cars earlier as the weight and cost penalties were less noticeable 106 diesel engines tend to be more economical at regular driving speeds and are much better at city speeds their reliability and life-span tend to be better as detailed some 40 percent or more of all cars sold in europe are diesel-powered where they are considered a low co2 option mercedes-benz in conjunction with robert bosch gmbh produced diesel-powered passenger cars starting in 1936 and very large numbers are used all over the world often as grande taxis in the third world diesel-powered passenger cars are very popular in india too since the price of diesel fuel there is lower as compared to petrol as a result predominantly petrol-powered car manufacturers including the japanese car manufacturers produce and market diesel-powered cars in india diesel-powered cars also dominate the indian taxi industry railroad rolling stockedit diesel engines have eclipsed steam engines as the prime mover on all non-electrified railroads in the industrialized world the first diesel locomotives appeared in the early 20th century and diesel multiple units soon after while electric locomotives have replaced the diesel locomotive for some passenger traffic in europe and asia diesel is still today very popular for cargo-hauling freight trains and on tracks where electrification is not feasible most modern diesel locomotives are actually diesel-electric locomotives the diesel engine is used to power an electric generator that in turn powers electric traction motors with no mechanical connection between diesel engine and traction after 2000 environmental requirements has caused higher development cost for engines and it has become common for passenger multiple units to use engines and automatic mechanical gearboxes made for trucks up to four such combinations might be used to achieve enough power in a train other transport usesedit larger transport applications trucks buses etc also benefit from the diesels reliability and high torque output diesel displaced paraffin or tractor vaporising oil tvo in most parts of the world by the end of the 1950s with the us following some 20 years later aircraft marine motorcycles in merchant ships and boats the same advantages apply with the relative safety of diesel fuel an additional benefit the german pocket battleships were the largest diesel warships but the german torpedo-boats known as e-boats schnellboot of the second world war were also diesel craft conventional submarines have used them since before world war i relying on the almost total absence of carbon monoxide in the exhaust american world war ii diesel-electric submarines operated on two-stroke cycle as opposed to the four-stroke cycle that other navies used non-road diesel enginesedit non-road diesel engines include mobile equipment and vehicles that are not used on the public roadways such as construction equipment and agricultural tractors military fuel standardisationedit nato has a single vehicle fuel policy and has selected diesel for this purpose the use of a single fuel simplifies wartime logistics nato and the united states marine corps have even been developing a diesel military motorcycle based on a kawasaki off road motorcycle the klr 650 with a purpose designed naturally aspirated direct injection diesel at cranfield university in england to be produced in the us because motorcycles were the last remaining gasoline-powered vehicle in their inventory before this a few civilian motorcycles had been built using adapted stationary diesel engines but the weight and cost disadvantages generally outweighed the efficiency gains non-transport usesedit diesel engines are also used to power permanent portable and backup generators irrigation pumps 107 corn grinders 108 and coffee de-pulpers 109 engine speedsedit within the diesel engine industry engines are often categorized by their rotational speeds into three unofficial groups high-speed engines  1,000 rpm medium-speed engines  300–1,000 rpm and slow-speed engines  300 rpm high- and medium-speed engines are predominantly four-stroke engines except for the detroit diesel two-stroke range medium-speed engines are physically larger than high-speed engines and can burn lower-grade slower-burning fuel than high-speed engines slow-speed engines are predominantly large two-stroke crosshead engines hence very different from high- and medium-speed engines due to the lower rotational speed of slow- and medium-speed engines there is more time for combustion during the power stroke of the cycle allowing the use of slower-burning fuels than high-speed engines high-speed enginesedit high-speed approximately 1,000rpm and greater engines are used to power trucks lorries buses tractors cars yachts compressors pumps and small electrical generators as of 2008 most high-speed engines have direct injection many modern engines particularly in on-highway applications have common rail direct injection which is cleaner burning medium-speed enginesedit medium-speed engines are used in large electrical generators ship propulsion and mechanical drive applications such as large compressors or pumps medium speed diesel engines operate on either diesel fuel or heavy fuel oil by direct injection in the same manner as low-speed engines engines used in electrical generators run at approximately 300 to 1000rpm and are optimized to run at a set synchronous speed depending on the generation frequency  50 or 60hertz and provide a rapid response to load changes typical synchronous speeds for modern medium-speed engines are 500/514rpm  50/60hz 600rpm both 50 and 60hz 720/750rpm and 900/1000rpm as of 2009 the largest medium-speed engines in current production have outputs up to approximately 20mw  27,000hp and are supplied by companies like man bw wärtsilä 110 and rolls-royce who acquired ulstein bergen diesel in 1999 most medium-speed engines produced are four-stroke machines however there are some two-stroke medium-speed engines such as by emd electro-motive diesel and the fairbanks morse op opposed-piston engine type typical cylinder bore size for medium-speed engines ranges from 20cm to 50cm and engine configurations typically are offered ranging from in-line 4-cylinder units to v-configuration 20-cylinder units most larger medium-speed engines are started with compressed air direct on pistons using an air distributor as opposed to a pneumatic starting motor acting on the flywheel which tends to be used for smaller engines there is no definitive engine size cut-off point for this it should also be noted that most major manufacturers of medium-speed engines make natural gas-fueled versions of their diesel engines which in fact operate on the otto cycle and require spark ignition typically provided with a spark plug 111 there are also dual dieselnatural gascoal gas fuel versions of medium and low speed diesel engines using a lean fuel air mixture and a small injection of diesel fuel so-called pilot fuel for ignition in case of a gas supply failure or maximum power demand these engines will instantly switch back to full diesel fuel operation 111 112 113 low-speed enginesedit also known as slow-speed or traditionally oil engines the largest diesel engines are primarily used to power ships although there are a few land-based power generation units as well these extremely large two-stroke engines have power outputs up to approximately 85mw  114,000hp operate in the range from approximately 60 to 200rpm and are up to 15m  50ft tall and can weigh over 2,000 short tons  1,800t they typically use direct injection running on cheap low-grade heavy fuel also known as bunker c fuel which requires heating in the ship for tanking and before injection due to the fuels high viscosity often the waste heat recovery steam boilers attached to the engine exhaust ducting generate the heat required for fuel heating provided the heavy fuel system is kept warm and circulating engines can be started and stopped on heavy fuel large and medium marine engines are started with compressed air directly applied to the pistons air is applied to cylinders to start the engine forwards or backwards because they are normally directly connected to the propeller without clutch or gearbox and to provide reverse propulsion either the engine must be run backwards or the ship will use an adjustable propeller at least three cylinders are required with two-stroke engines and at least six cylinders with four-stroke engines to provide torque every 120 degrees companies such as man bw diesel and wärtsilä design such large low-speed engines they are unusually narrow and tall due to the addition of a crosshead bearing as of 2007 the 14-cylinder wärtsilä-sulzer 14rtflex96-c turbocharged two-stroke diesel engine built by wärtsilä licensee doosan in korea is the most powerful diesel engine put into service with a cylinder bore of 960mm  37.8in delivering 114,800hp  85.6mw it was put into service in september 2006 aboard what was then the worlds largest container ship emma maersk which belongs to the ap moller-maersk group typical bore size for low-speed engines ranges from approximately 35 to 98cm  14 to 39in as of 2008 all produced low-speed engines with crosshead bearings are in-line configurations no vee versions have been produced low-speed diesel engines as used in ships and other applications where overall engine weight is relatively unimportant often have a thermal efficiency which exceeds 50 1 2 current and future developmentsedit as of 2008 many common rail and unit injection systems already employ new injectors using stacked piezoelectric wafers in lieu of a solenoid giving finer control of the injection event 114 variable geometry turbochargers have flexible vanes which move and let more air into the engine depending on load this technology increases both performance and fuel economy boost lag is reduced as turbo impeller inertia is compensated for 115 accelerometer pilot control apc uses an accelerometer to provide feedback on the engines level of noise and vibration and thus instruct the ecu to inject the minimum amount of fuel that will produce quiet combustion and still provide the required power especially while idling 116 the next generation of common rail diesels is expected to use variable injection geometry which allows the amount of fuel injected to be varied over a wider range and variable valve timing see mitsubishis 4n13 diesel engine similar to that of petrol engines particularly in the united states coming tougher emissions regulations present a considerable challenge to diesel engine manufacturers fords hytrans project has developed a system which starts the ignition in 400 ms saving a significant amount of fuel on city routes and there are other methods to achieve even more efficient combustion such as homogeneous charge compression ignition being studied 117 118 japanese and swedish vehicle manufacturers are also developing diesel engines that run on dimethyl ether dme 119 120 some recent diesel engine models utilize a copper alloy heat exchanger technology cuprobraze to take advantage of benefits in terms of thermal performance heat transfer efficiency strengthdurability corrosion resistance and reduced emissions from higher operating temperatures low heat rejection enginesedit a special class of experimental prototype internal combustion piston engines has been developed over several decades with the goal of improving efficiency by reducing heat loss 121 these engines are variously called adiabatic engines due to better approximation of adiabatic expansion low heat rejection engines or high temperature engines 122 they are generally piston engines with combustion chamber parts lined with ceramic thermal barrier coatings 123 some make use of pistons and other parts made of titanium which has a low thermal conductivity 124 and density some designs are able to eliminate the use of a cooling system and associated parasitic losses altogether 125 developing lubricants able to withstand the higher temperatures involved has been a major barrier to commercialization 126 see alsoedit aircraft diesel engine bore carbureted compression ignition model engine control theory diesel locomotive diesel
