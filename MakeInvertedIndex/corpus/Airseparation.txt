air separation an air separation plant separates atmospheric air into its primary components typically nitrogen and oxygen and sometimes also argon and other rare inert gases the most common method for air separation is cryogenic distillation cryogenic air separation units asus are built to provide nitrogen or oxygen and often co-produce argon other methods such as membrane pressure swing adsorption psa and vacuum pressure swing adsorption vpsa are commercially used to separate a single component from ordinary air high purity oxygen nitrogen and argon used for semiconductor device fabrication requires cryogenic distillation similarly the only viable sources of the rare gases neon krypton and xenon is the distillation of air using at least two distillation columns  contents 1 cryogenic distillation process 2 non-cryogenic processes 3 applications 4 see also 5 references 6 external links  cryogenic distillation processedit pure gases can be separated from air by first cooling it until it liquefies then selectively distilling the components at their various boiling temperatures the process can produce high purity gases but is energy-intensive this process was pioneered by dr carl von linde in the early 20th century and is still used today to produce high purity gases 2 the cryogenic separation process  3 4 5 requires a very tight integration of heat exchangers and separation columns to obtain a good efficiency and all the energy for refrigeration is provided by the compression of the air at the inlet of the unit to achieve the low distillation temperatures an air separation unit requires a refrigeration cycle that operates by means of the joulethomson effect and the cold equipment has to be kept within an insulated enclosure commonly called a cold box the cooling of the gases requires a large amount of energy to make this refrigeration cycle work and is delivered by an air compressor modern asus use expansion turbines for cooling the output of the expander helps drive the air compressor for improved efficiency the process consists of the following main steps the separated products are sometimes supplied by pipeline to large industrial users near the production plant long distance transportation of products is by shipping liquid product for large quantities or as dewar flasks or gas cylinders for small quantities non-cryogenic processesedit pressure swing adsorption provides separation of oxygen or nitrogen from air without liquefication the process operates around ambient temperature a zeolite molecular sponge is exposed to high pressure air then the air is released and an adsorbed film of the desired gas is released the size of compressor is much reduced over a liquification plant and portable oxygen concentrators are made in this manner to provide oxygen-enriched air for medical purposes vacuum swing adsorption is a similar process but the product gas is evolved from the zeolite at sub-atmospheric pressure membrane technologies can provide alternate lower-energy approaches to air separation for example a number of approaches are being explored for oxygen generation polymeric membranes operating at ambient or warm temperatures for example may be able to produce oxygen-enriched air  25-50 oxygen ceramic membranes can provide high-purity oxygen  90 or more but require higher temperatures  800-900 deg c to operate these ceramic membranes include ion transport membranes itm and oxygen transport membranes otm air products and chemicals inc and praxair are developing flat itm and tubular otm systems respectively membrane gas separation is used to provide oxygen poor and nitrogen rich gases instead of air to fill the fuel tanks of jet liners thus greatly reducing the chances of accidental fires conversely membrane gas separation is currently used to provide oxygen enriched air to pilots flying at great altitudes in aircraft without pressurized cabins applicationsedit large amounts of oxygen are required for coal gasification projects cryogenic plants producing 3000 tonsday are found in some projects 8 in steelmaking oxygen is required for the basic oxygen steelmaking large amounts of nitrogen with low oxygen impurities are used for inerting storage tanks of ships and tanks for petroleum products or for protecting edible oil products from oxidation see alsoedit cryogenic nitrogen plant cryogenic oxygen plant gas separation gas to liquids hampsonlinde cycle industrial gases liquid air liquefaction of gases louis paul cailletet oxygen concentrator siemens cycle referencesedit external linksedit simulation of air separation plants
