oil shale kerogen quartz feldspar clay carbonate pyrite uranium iron vanadium nickel molybdenum oil shale is an organic-rich fine-grained sedimentary rock containing kerogen a solid mixture of organic chemical compounds from which liquid hydrocarbons called shale oil not to be confused with tight oilcrude oil occurring naturally in shales can be produced some authors suggest the alternative name kerogen shale but this has not been in common use anywhere in the oil shale industry over the last 170 years the terms oil shale for the rock and shale oil for the product liquid have been in use in english for at least 110 years shale oil is a substitute for conventional crude oil however extracting shale oil from oil shale is more costly than the production of conventional crude oil both financially and in terms of its environmental impact 1 deposits of oil shale occur around the world including major deposits in the united states estimates of global deposits range from 4.8 to 5 trillion barrels  760×10 ^9 to 790×10 ^9m3 of oil in place 2 3 heating oil shale to a sufficiently high temperature causes the chemical process of pyrolysis to yield a vapor upon cooling the vapor the liquid shale oilan unconventional oilis separated from combustible oil-shale gas the term shale gas can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales oil shale can also be burned directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for power generation and district heating or used as a raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing 4 oil shale gains attention as a potential abundant source of oil whenever the price of crude oil rises 5 6 at the same time oil-shale mining and processing raise a number of environmental concerns such as land use waste disposal water use waste-water management greenhouse-gas emissions and air pollution 7 8 estonia and china have well-established oil shale industries and brazil germany and russia also utilize oil shale 9 general composition of oil shales constitutes inorganic matrix bitumens and kerogen oil shales differ from oil-bearing shales shale deposits that contain petroleum tight oil that is sometimes produced from drilled wells

sedimentary rock belongs to the group of sapropel fuels 10 it does not have a definite geological definition nor a specific chemical formula and its seams do not always have discrete boundaries oil shales vary considerably in their mineral content chemical composition age type of kerogen and depositional history and not all oil shales would necessarily be classified as shales in the strict sense 11 12 according to the petrologist adrian c hutton of the university of wollongong oil shales are not geological nor geochemically distinctive rock but rather economic term 13 their common defining feature is low solubility in low-boiling organic solvents and generation of liquid organic products on thermal decomposition 14 oil shale differs from bitumen-impregnated rocks oil sands and petroleum reservoir rocks humic coals and carbonaceous shale while oil sands do originate from the biodegradation of oil heat and pressure have not yet transformed the kerogen in oil shale into petroleum that means that its maturation does not exceed early mesocatagenetic 14 15 16 general composition of oil shales constitutes inorganic matrix bitumens and kerogen while the bitumen portion of oil shales is soluble in carbon disulfide kerogen portion is insoluble in carbon disulfide and can contain iron vanadium nickel molybdenum and uranium 17 oil shale contains a lower percentage of organic matter than coal in commercial grades of oil shale the ratio of organic matter to mineral matter lies approximately between 0.75:5 and 1.5:5 at the same time the organic matter in oil shale has an atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon hc approximately 1.2 to 1.8times lower than for crude oil and about 1.5 to 3times higher than for coals 10 18 19 the organic components of oil shale derive from a variety of organisms such as the remains of algae spores pollen plant cuticles and corky fragments of herbaceous and woody plants and cellular debris from other aquatic and land plants 18 20 some deposits contain significant fossils germanys messel pit has the status of a unesco world heritage site the mineral matter in oil shale includes various fine-grained silicates and carbonates 4 10 inorganic matrix can contain quartz feldspars clays mainly illite and chlorite carbonates calcite and dolomites pyrite and some other minerals 17 geologists can classify oil shales on the basis of their composition as carbonate-rich shales siliceous shales or cannel shales 21 another classification known as the van krevelen diagram assigns kerogen types depending on the hydrogen carbon and oxygen content of oil shales original organic matter 12 the most commonly used classification of oil shales developed between 1987 and 1991 by adrian c hutton adapts petrographic terms from coal terminology this classification designates oil shales as terrestrial lacustrine lake-bottom-deposited or marine ocean bottom-deposited based on the environment of the initial biomass deposit 4 22 known oil shales are predominantly aquatic marine lacustrine origin 14 22 huttons classification scheme has proven useful in estimating the yield and composition of the extracted oil 23 resourceedit as source rocks for most conventional oil reservoirs oil shale deposits are found in all world oil provinces although most of them are too deep to be exploited economically 3 as with all oil and gas resources analysts distinguish between oil shale resources and oil shale reserves resources refers to all oil shale deposits while reserves represents those deposits from which producers can extract oil shale economically using existing technology since extraction technologies develop continuously planners can only estimate the amount of recoverable kerogen 1 4 although resources of oil shale occur in many countries only 33countries possess known deposits of possible economic value  24 25 well-explored deposits potentially classifiable as reserves include the green river deposits in the western united states the tertiary deposits in queensland australia deposits in sweden and estonia the el-lajjun deposit in jordan and deposits in france germany brazil china southern mongolia and russia these deposits have given rise to expectations of yielding at least 40liters of shale oil per tonne of oil shale using the fischer assay 4 12 a 2008 estimate set the total world resources of oil shale at 689gigatons equivalent to yield of 4.8 trillion barrels  760billion cubic metres of shale oil with the largest reserves in the united states which is thought to have 3.7 trillion barrels  590billion cubic metres though only a part of it is recoverable 2 according to the 2010 world energy outlook by the international energy agency the world oil shale resources may be equivalent of more than 5 trillion barrels  790billion cubic metres of oil in place of which more than 1 trillion barrels  160billion cubic metres may be technically recoverable 3 for comparison the worlds proven conventional oil reserves were estimated at 1.317 trillion barrels  209.4×10 ^9m3 as of 1 january 2007 26 the largest deposits in the world occur in the united states in the green river formation which covers portions of colorado utah and wyoming about 70 of this resource lies on land owned or managed by the united states federal government 27 deposits in the united states constitute 62 of world resources together the united states russia and brazil account for 86 of the worlds resources in terms of shale-oil content 24 these figures remain tentative with exploration or analysis of several deposits still outstanding 4 professor alan r carroll of university of wisconsinmadison regards the upper permian lacustrine oil-shale deposits of northwest china absent from previous global oil shale assessments as comparable in size to the green river formation 28 historyedit humans have used oil shale as a fuel since prehistoric times since it generally burns without any processing 30 britons of the iron age also used to polish it and form it into ornaments 31 the first patent for extracting oil from oil shale was british crown patent 330 granted in 1694 to three persons named martin eele thomas hancock and william portlock who had found a way to extract and make great quantities of pitch tarr and oyle out of a sort of stone 32 33 34 modern industrial mining of oil shale began in 1837 in autun france followed by exploitation in scotland germany and several other countries 35 36 operations during the 19th century focused on the production of kerosene lamp oil and paraffin these products helped supply the growing demand for lighting that arose during the industrial revolution 37 fuel oil lubricating oil and grease and ammonium sulfate were also produced 38 the european oil-shale industry expanded immediately before world war i due to limited access to conventional petroleum resources and to the mass production of automobiles and trucks which accompanied an increase in gasoline consumption although the estonian and chinese oil-shale industries continued to grow after world war ii most other countries abandoned their projects due to high processing costs and the availability of cheaper petroleum 4 36 39 40 following the 1973 oil crisis world production of oil shale reached a peak of 46million tonnes in 1980 before falling to about 16million tonnes in 2000 due to competition from cheap conventional petroleum in the 1980s 7 24 on 2 may 1982 known in some circles as black sunday exxon canceled its us$5billion colony shale oil project near parachute colorado because of low oil-prices and increased expenses laying off more than 2,000workers and leaving a trail of home-foreclosures and small-business bankruptcies 41 in 1986 president ronald reagan signed into law the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 which among other things abolished the united states synthetic liquid fuels program 42 the global oil-shale industry began to revive at the beginning of the 21st century in 2003 an oil-shale development program restarted in the united states authorities introduced a commercial leasing program permitting the extraction of oil shale and oil sands on federal lands in 2005 in accordance with the energy policy act of 2005 43 44 industryedit as of 2008update industry uses oil shale in brazil china estonia and to some extent in germany and russia several additional countries started assessing their reserves or had built experimental production plants while others had phased out their oil shale industry 9 oil shale serves for oil production in estonia brazil and china for power generation in estonia china and germany for cement production in estonia germany and china and for use in chemical industries in china estonia and russia 9 40 45 46 as of 2009update 80 of oil shale used globally is extracted in estonia mainly due to the oil-shale-fired power plants 45 47 oil-shale-fired power plants occur in estonia which has an installed capacity of 2,967megawatts mw china  12mw and germany  9.9mw 24 48 israel romania and russia have in the past run power plants fired by oil shale but have shut them down or switched to other fuel sources such as natural gas 9 24 49 jordan and egypt plan to construct power plants fired by oil shale while canada and turkey plan to burn oil shale along with coal for power generation 24 50 oil shale serves as the main fuel for power generation only in estonia where the oil-shale-fired narva power plants accounted for 95 of countrys electrical generation in 2005 51 according to the world energy council in 2008 the total production of shale oil from oil shale was 930,000tonnes equal to 17,700 barrels per day  2,810m3d of which china produced 375,000tonnes estonia 355,000tonnes and brazil 200,000tonnes 2 in comparison production of the conventional oil and natural gas liquids in 2008 amounted 3.95billion tonnes or 82.1 million barrels per day  13.1×10 ^6m3d 52 extraction and processingedit most exploitation of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere after which one can burn the shale directly to generate electricity or undertake further processing the most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining these procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface underground mining of oil shale which removes less of the overlying material employs the room-and-pillar method 53 the extraction of the useful components of oil shale usually takes place above ground ex-situ processing although several newer technologies perform this underground on-site or in-situ processing 54 in either case the chemical process of pyrolysis converts the kerogen in the oil shale to shale oil synthetic crude oil and oil shale gas most conversion technologies involve heating shale in the absence of oxygen to a temperature at which kerogen decomposes pyrolyses into gas condensable oil and a solid residue this usually takes place between 450c  842f and 500c  932f 1 the process of decomposition begins at relatively low temperatures  300c or 572f but proceeds more rapidly and more completely at higher temperatures 55 in-situ processing involves heating the oil shale underground such technologies can potentially extract more oil from a given area of land than ex-situ processes since they can access the material at greater depths than surface mines can several companies have patented methods for in-situ retorting however most of these methods remain in the experimental phase one can distinguish true in-situ processes tis and modified in-situ processes mis true in-situ processes do not involve mining the oil shale modified in-situ processes involve removing part of the oil shale and bringing it to the surface for modified in-situ retorting in order to create permeability for gas flow in a rubble chimney explosives rubblize the oil-shale deposit 56 hundreds of patents for oil shale retorting technologies exist 57 however only a few dozen have undergone testing by 2006 only four technologies remained in commercial use kiviter galoter fushun and petrosix 58 applications and productsedit industry can use oil shale as a fuel for thermal power-plants burning it like coal to drive steam turbines some of these plants employ the resulting heat for district heating of homes and businesses in addition to its use as a fuel oil shale may also serve in the production of specialty carbon fibers adsorbent carbons carbon black phenols resins glues tanning agents mastic road bitumen cement bricks construction and decorative blocks soil-additives fertilizers rock-wool insulation glass and pharmaceutical products 45 however oil shale use for production of these items remains small or only in its experimental stages 4 59 some oil shales yield sulfur ammonia alumina soda ash uranium and nahcolite as shale-oil extraction byproducts between 1946 and 1952 a marine type of dictyonema shale served for uranium production in sillamäe estonia and between 1950 and 1989 sweden used alum shale for the same purposes 4 oil shale gas has served as a substitute for natural gas but as of 2009update producing oil shale gas as a natural-gas substitute remained economically infeasible 60 61 the shale oil derived from oil shale does not directly substitute for crude oil in all applications it may contain higher concentrations of olefins oxygen and nitrogen than conventional crude oil 42 some shale oils may have higher sulfur or arsenic content by comparison with west texas intermediate the benchmark standard for crude oil in the futures-contract market the green river shale oil sulfur content ranges from near 0 to 4.9 in average 0.76 where west texas intermediates sulfur content has a maximum of 0.42 62 the sulfur content in shale oil from jordans oil shales may rise even up to 9.5 63 the arsenic content for example becomes an issue for green river formation oil shale the higher concentrations of these materials means that the oil must undergo considerable upgrading hydrotreating before serving as oil-refinery feedstock 64 above-ground retorting processes tended to yield a lower api gravity shale oil than the in situ processes shale oil serves best for producing middle-distillates such as kerosene jet fuel and diesel fuel worldwide demand for these middle distillates particularly for diesel fuels increased rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s 42 65 however appropriate refining processes equivalent to hydrocracking can transform shale oil into a lighter-range hydrocarbon gasoline 42 economicsedit the amount of economically recoverable oil shale is unknown 3 the various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the cost of shale-oil production in a given region comes in below the price of crude oil or its other substitutes according to a survey conducted by the rand corporation the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the united states comprising a mine retorting plant upgrading plant supporting utilities and spent shale reclamation would range between us$70–95 $440–600m3 adjusted to 2005 values this estimate considers varying levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency in order to run a profitable operation the price of crude oil would need to remain above these levels the analysis also discusses the expectation that processing costs would drop after the establishment of the complex the hypothetical unit would see a cost reduction of 35–70 after producing its first 500 million barrels  79×10 ^6m3 assuming an increase in output of 25 thousand barrels per day  4.0×10 ^3m3d during each year after the start of commercial production rand predicts the costs would decline to $35–48 per barrel $220–300m3 within 12 years after achieving the milestone of 1 billion barrels  160×10 ^6m3 its costs would decline further to $30–40 per barrel $190–250m3 45 53 some commentators compare the proposed american oil-shale industry to the athabasca oil-sands industry the latter enterprise generated over 1 million barrels  160,000m3 of oil per day in late 2007 stating that the first-generation facility is the hardest both technically and economically 66 67 in 2005 royal dutch shell announced that its in-situ process could become competitive for oil prices over $30per barrel $190m3 68 a 2004 report by the united states department of energy stated that both the shell technology and technology used in the stuart oil shale project could be competitive at prices above $25 per barrel and that the viru keemia grupp expected full-scale production to be economical at prices above $18per barrel $130m3 56 69 to increase efficiency when retorting oil shale researchers have proposed and tested several co-pyrolysis processes 70 71 72 73 74 a 1972 publication in the journal pétrole informations issn 0755-561x compared shale-based oil production unfavorably with coal liquefaction the article portrayed coal liquefaction as less expensive generating more oil and creating fewer environmental impacts than extraction from oil shale it cited a conversion ratio of 650 liters  170usgal 140impgal of oil per one ton of coal as against 150 liters  40usgal 33impgal of shale oil per one ton of oil shale 36 a critical measure of the viability of oil shale as an energy source lies in the ratio of the energy produced by the shale to the energy used in its mining and processing a ratio known as energy returned on energy invested eroei a 1984 study estimated the eroei of the various known oil-shale deposits as varying between 0.7–13.3 75 although known oil-shale extraction development projects assert an eroei between 3 and 10 according to the world energy outlook 2010 the eroei of ex-situ processing is typically 4 to 5 while of in-situ processing it may be even as low as 2 however according to the iea most of used energy can be provided by burning the spent shale or oil-shale gas 76 the water needed in the oil shale retorting process offers an additional economic consideration this may pose a problem in areas with water scarcity environmental considerationsedit mining oil shale involves a number of environmental impacts more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining 77 these include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials the introduction of metals including mercury 78 into surface-water and groundwater increased erosion sulfur-gas emissions and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing transport and support activities 7 8 in 2002 about 97 of air pollution 86 of total waste and 23 of water pollution in estonia came from the power industry which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production 79 oil-shale extraction can damage the biological and recreational value of land and the ecosystem in the mining area combustion and thermal processing generate waste material in addition the atmospheric emissions from oil shale processing and combustion include carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale as it creates even more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels 80 section 526 of the energy independence and security act prohibits united states government agencies from buying oil produced by processes that produce more greenhouse gas emissions than would traditional petroleum 81 experimental in situ conversion processes and carbon capture and storage technologies may reduce some of these concerns in the future but at the same time they may cause other problems including groundwater pollution 82 among the water contaminants commonly associated with oil shale processing are oxygen and nitrogen heterocyclic hydrocarbons commonly detected examples include quinoline derivatives pyridine and various alkyl homologues of pyridine picoline lutidine 83 some have expressed concerns over the oil shale industrys use of water in 2002 the oil shale-fired power industry used 91 of the water consumed in estonia 79 depending on technology above-ground retorting uses between one and five barrels of water per barrel of produced shale-oil 53 84 85 86 a 2008 programmatic environmental impact statement issued by the us bureau of land management stated that surface mining and retort operations produce 2 to 10 us gallons  7.6 to 37.9l 1.7 to 8.3impgal of waste water per 1 short ton  0.91t of processed oil shale 84 in situ processing according to one estimate uses about one-tenth as much water 87 water concerns become particularly sensitive issues in arid regions such as the western us and israels negev desert where plans exist to expand oil-shale extraction despite a water shortage 88 environmental activists including members of greenpeace have organized strong protests against the oil shale industry in one result queensland energy resources put the proposed stuart oil shale project in australia on hold in 2004 7 89 90 extraterrestrial oil shaleedit some
