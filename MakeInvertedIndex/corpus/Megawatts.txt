electromagnetism one watt is the rate at which work is done when one ampere a of current flows through an electrical potential difference of one volt v two additional unit conversions for watt can be found using the above equation and ohms law where ohm  ω displaystyle omega   is the si derived unit of electrical resistance a person having a mass of 100 kilograms who climbs a 3-meter-high ladder in 5 seconds is doing work at a rate of about 600 watts mass times acceleration due to gravity times height divided by the time it takes to lift the object to the given height gives the rate of doing work or powernotes 1 a laborer over the course of an 8-hour day can sustain an average output of about 75 watts higher power levels can be achieved for short intervals and by athletes 2 origin and adoption as an si unitedit the watt is named after the scottish scientist james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine the measurement unit was recognized by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in 1882 concurrent with the start of commercial power production from both water and steam in 1960 the 11th general conference on weights and measures adopted it for the measurement of power into the international system of units si multiplesedit femtowattedit the femtowatt is equal to one quadrillionth  10−15 of a watt technologically important powers that are measured in femtowatts are typically found in references to radio and radar receivers for example meaningful fm tuner performance figures for sensitivity quieting and signal-to-noise require that the rf energy applied to the antenna input be specified these input levels are often stated in dbf decibels referenced to 1 femtowatt this is 0.2739 microvolt across a 75-ohm load or 0.5477 microvolt across a 300-ohm load the specification takes into account the rf input impedance of the tuner picowattedit the picowatt is equal to one trillionth  10−12 of a watt technologically important powers that are measured in picowatts are typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers acoustics and in the science of radio astronomy nanowattedit the nanowatt is equal to one billionth  10−9 of a watt important powers that are measured in nanowatts are also typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers microwattedit the microwatt is equal to one millionth  10−6 of a watt important powers that are measured in microwatts are typically stated in medical instrumentation systems such as the eeg and the ecg in a wide variety of scientific and engineering instruments and also in reference to radio and radar receivers compact solar cells for devices such as calculators and watches are typically measured in microwatts 3 milliwattedit the milliwatt is equal to one thousandth  10−3 of a watt a typical laser pointer outputs about five milliwatts of light power whereas a typical hearing aid for people uses less than one milliwatt 4 audio signals and other electronic signal levels are often measured in dbm referenced to one milliwatt kilowattedit the kilowatt is equal to one thousand  103 watts this unit is typically used to express the output power of engines and the power of electric motors tools machines and heaters it is also a common unit used to express the electromagnetic power output of broadcast radio and television transmitters one kilowatt is approximately equal to 1.34 horsepower a small electric heater with one heating element can use 1.0 kilowatt the average electric power consumption of a household in the united states is about one kilowattnotes 2 5 also kilowatts of light power can be measured in the output pulses of some lasers a surface area of one square meter on earth receives typically about one kilowatt of sunlight from the sun the solar irradiance on a clear day at mid day close to the equator 6 megawattedit the megawatt is equal to one million  106 watts many events or machines produce or sustain the conversion of energy on this scale including large electric motors large warships such as aircraft carriers cruisers and submarines large server farms or data centers and some scientific research equipment such as supercolliders and the output pulses of very large lasers a large residential or commercial building may use several megawatts in electric power and heat on railways modern high-powered electric locomotives typically have a peak power output of 5 or 6mw although some produce much more the eurostar for example uses more than 12mw while heavy diesel-electric locomotives typically produceuse 3 to 5mw us nuclear power plants have net summer capacities between about 500 and 1300mw 7 the earliest citing of the megawatt in the oxford english dictionary oed is a reference in the 1900 websters international dictionary of english language the oed also states that megawatt appeared in a 28 november 1947 article in the journal science  506:2 gigawattedit the gigawatt is equal to one billion  109 watts or 1 gigawatt  1000 megawatts this unit is often used for large power plants or power grids for example by the end of 2010 power shortages in chinas shanxi province were expected to increase to 5–6 gw 8 and the installed capacity of wind power in germany was 25.8 gw 9 the largest unit out of four of the belgian doel nuclear power station has a peak output of 1.04 gw 10 hvdc converters have been built with power ratings of up to 2gw 11 terawattedit the terawatt is equal to one trillion  1012 watts the total power used by humans worldwide is commonly measured in terawatts see primary energy the most powerful lasers from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s produced power in terawatts but only for nanosecond time frames the average lightning strike peaks at 1 terawatt but these strikes only last for 30 microseconds petawattedit the petawatt is equal to one quadrillion  1015 watts and can be produced by the current generation of lasers for time-scales on the order of picoseconds  10−12s one such laser is the lawrence livermores nova laser which achieved a power output of 1.25pw  7015125000000000000♠1.25×1015w by a process called chirped pulse amplification the duration of the pulse was roughly 0.5ps  6987500000000000000♠5×10−13s giving a total energy of 600j or enough energy to power a 100w light bulb for six seconds

duration of approximately 1ps 13 14 based on the average total solar irradiance 15 of 1.366kwm2 the total power of sunlight striking earths atmosphere is estimated at 174pw see solar constant electrical and thermal wattsedit in the electric power industry megawatt electrical mwe 16 or mwe 17 is electric power while megawatt thermal or thermal megawatt 18 mwt mwt or mwth mwth refers to thermal power produced other si prefixes are sometimes used for example gigawatt electrical gwe the international bureau of weights and measures which maintains the si-standard states that further information about a quantity should not be attached to the unit symbol but instead to the quantity symbol ie pthermal 270w rather than p 270wth and regards these symbols as incorrect and thus non-si 19 for example the embalse nuclear power plant in argentina uses a fission reactor to generate 2109mwt ie heat which creates steam to drive a turbine which generates 648mwe ie electricity radio transmissionedit radio stations usually report the power of their transmitters in units of watts referring to the effective radiated power it refers to the relative power of the transmission when it is directed towards the horizon for maximum geographic coverage rather than uniformly broadcast in all directions confusion of watts watt-hours and watts per houredit the terms power and energy are frequently confused power is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed and hence is measured in units eg watts that represent energy per unit time for example when a light bulb with a power rating of 100w is turned on for one hour the energy used is 100watt hours wh 0.1kilowatt hour or 360 kj this same amount of energy would light a 40-watt bulb for 2.5hours or a 50-watt bulb for 2hours a power station would be rated in multiples of watts for example the three gorges dam is rated at approximately 22 gigawatts but its annual energy sales or output would be in multiples of watt hours major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt hours for a given period that is often a calendar year or financial year one terawatt hour is equal to a sustained power of approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one year the watt second is a unit of energy equal to the joule one kilowatt hour is 3 600 000 watt seconds the watt second is used for example to rate the energy storage of flash lamps used in photography although the term joule is generally employed terms such as watts per hour wh are often misused when watts would be correct 20 watts per hour properly refers to a change of power per hour watts per hour might be useful to characterize the ramp-up behavior of power plants for example a power plant that changes its power output from 0mw to 1mw in 15 minutes has a ramp-up rate of 4mwh hydroelectric power plants have a very high ramp-up rate which makes them particularly useful in peak load and emergency situations the misnomer watts per hour is essentially the derivative of power and should be called rate of watt change per hour see alsoedit conversion of units declared net capacity power plants metretonnesecond system of units orders of
