mercedes-benz bionic the mercedes-benz bionic was a concept car created by daimlerchrysler ag under the mercedes group it was first introduced in 2005 at the daimlerchrysler innovation symposium in washington d c the bionic was modelled after a type of fish the yellow boxfish ostracion cubicus 1 and also has 80 lower nitrogen oxide emissions with its selective catalytic reduction technology  contents 1 engine and performance 2 design 3 references 4 external links  engine and performanceedit the bionic is powered by a 103kw direct-injection diesel engine that gives out around 70 mpg us ~3.36 l/100km this engine also gives out around a total of 140 horsepower  100kw and a little over 221ftlbf  300nm of torque at around 1600 rpm the bionic can go from 0-60 in about 8 seconds and has a top speed of a little over 190kmh  118mph  designedit the exterior design was modelled after the yellow boxfish ostracion cubicus a marine fish that lives in coral reefs mercedes-benz decided to model the bionic after this fish due to the supposed low coefficient of drag of its body shape and the rigidity of its exoskeleton this influenced the cars unusual looks other parts of the design include the fact that the rear wheels are partially fitted with plastic and that its considered as a lightweight vehicle mercedes-benz reported a drag coefficient of 0.19 2 for comparison the production vehicle with the lowest ever cd value was the gm ev1 at 0.195 while the bionic had a much larger internal volume than the ev1 the bionics larger frontal area made the ev1 more aerodynamic overall as drag is a product of the area and the drag coefficient referencesedit external linksedit the mercedes-benz bionic car as a concept vehicle mercedes-benz uk bionic car description mercedes-benz bionic concept vehicle at worldcarfanscom
