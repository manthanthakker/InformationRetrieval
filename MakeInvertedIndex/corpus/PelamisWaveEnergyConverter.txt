pelamis wave energy converter biofuel biomass geothermal hydropower solar energy tidal power wave power wind power topics by country 100 renewable energy marketing and policy trends v t e the pelamis wave energy converter is a technology that uses the motion of ocean surface waves to create electricity the machine is made up of connected sections which flex and bend as waves pass it is this motion which is used to generate electricity developed by the now defunct  1 scottish company pelamis wave power formerly ocean power delivery the pelamis became the first offshore wave machine to generate electricity into the grid when it was first connected to the uk grid in 2004 2 pelamis wave power then went on to build and test five additional pelamis machines three first-generation p1 machines which were tested in a farm off the coast of portugal in 2009 and two second-generation machines the pelamis p2 which started tests off orkney in 2010needs update  contents 1 operation 2 principle 3

converter operating in water depths greater than 50m the machine consists of a series of semi-submerged cylindrical sections linked by hinged joints as waves pass along the length of the machine the sections move relative to one another the wave-induced motion of the sections is resisted by hydraulic cylinders which pump high pressure oil through hydraulic motors via smoothing hydraulic accumulators the hydraulic motors drive electrical generators to produce electricity electricity from all the joints is fed down a single umbilical cable to a junction on the sea bed several devices can be connected and linked to shore through a single seabed cable principleedit the pelamis is an attenuating wave energy converter the machine responds to the curvature of the waves their shape rather than the wave height as waves can only reach a certain curvature before naturally breaking this limits the range of motion through which the machine must move but maintains large motion at the joints in small waves projectsedit p2 pelamis testing at emecedit the p2 pelamis design was pelamis wave powers second generation pelamis machine the pelamis p2 is 180m long 4m diameter and approximately 1350 tonnes in weight consisting of five tube sections and four flexible joints the design is longer and fatter than the previous p1 design in 2010 pelamis wave power began tests of the first pelamis p2 machine at the european marine energy centre orkney scotland the machine is owned by the german utility company eon and was the uks first commercial supply contract in the marine energy sector 3 in march 2010 pelamis wave power announced a second order for a p2 machine from scottishpower renewables part of iberdrola renovables 4 this second machine was installed for the first time at emec in may 2012 5 the two utility companies have announced that they will work together to share and collaborate in testing of the p2 pelamis technology 6 projects formerly in developmentedit eon and scottishpower renewables have announced plans to build larger projects using pelamis machines in the waters off orkneys west coast 7 both companies won leases in 2010 from the crown estate who own the seabed around the uk for projects of up to 50mw the pentland firth and orkney waters leasing round was the worlds first commercial scale wave and tidal energy leasing opportunity 8 development historyedit prototype pelamis machineedit pelamis wave power tested their first full-scale prototype at the european marine energy centre in orkney scotland between 2004 and 2007 the machine which was rated at 750kw was the worlds first offshore wave power machine to generate electricity into the grid system the prototype was 120m long and 3.5m in diameter it consisted of four tube sections linked by three shorter power conversion modules 9 aguçadoura wave farmedit in 2008 pelamis tested three first generation p1 pelamis waves at the aguçadoura wave farm located off the northwest coast of portugal near póvoa de varzim the farm had an installed capacity of 2.25mw and was the worlds first multiple machine wave power project 10 the project was part funded by portuguese utility enersis 11 at the time owned by australian global investment company babcock  brown 12 the farm first generated electricity in july 2008 but was taken offline in november 2008 at the same time as babcock  brown encountered financial difficulties 13 etymologyedit pelamis platurus is a yellow-bellied sea snake that lives in tropical and subtropical waters it prefers shallow inshore waters imagesedit 2 of 3
