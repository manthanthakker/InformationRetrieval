green computing green computing green ict as per ifg international federation of green ict and ifg standard green it or ict sustainability is the study and practice of environmentally sustainable computing or it san murugesan notes that this can include designing manufacturing using and disposing of computers servers and associated subsystemssuch as monitors printers storage devices and networking and communications systems  efficiently and effectively with minimal or no effect on the environment 1 the goals of green computing are similar to green chemistry reduce the use of hazardous materials maximize energy efficiency during the products lifetime and promote the recyclability or biodegradability of defunct products and factory waste green computing is important for all classes of systems ranging from handheld systems 2 to large-scale data centers 3 many corporate it departments have green computing initiatives to reduce the environmental effect of their it

environmental protection agency launched energy star a voluntary labeling program that is designed to promote and recognize energy-efficiency in monitors climate control equipment and other technologies this resulted in the widespread adoption of sleep mode among consumer electronics concurrently the swedish organization tco development launched the tco certification program to promote low magnetic and electrical emissions from crt-based computer displays this program was later expanded to include criteria on energy consumption ergonomics and the use of hazardous materials in construction 5 regulations and industry initiativesedit the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd has published a survey of over 90 government and industry initiatives on green icts ie information and communication technologies the environment and climate change the report concludes that initiatives tend to concentrate on the greening icts themselves rather than on their actual implementation to tackle global warming and environmental degradation in general only 20 of initiatives have measurable targets with government programs tending to include targets more frequently than business associations 6 governmentedit many governmental agencies have continued to implement standards and regulations that encourage green computing the energy star program was revised in october 2006 to include stricter efficiency requirements for computer equipment along with a tiered ranking system for approved products 7 8 by 2008 26 us states established statewide recycling programs for obsolete computers and consumer electronics equipment 9 the statutes either impose an advance recovery fee for each unit sold at retail or require the manufacturers to reclaim the equipment at disposal in 2010 the american recovery and reinvestment act arra was signed into legislation by president obama the bill allocated over $90 billion to be invested in green initiatives renewable energy smart grids energy efficiency etc in january 2010 the us energy department granted $47 million of the arra money towards projects that aim to improve the energy efficiency of data centers the projects provided research to optimize data center hardware and software improve power supply chain and data center cooling technologies 10 industryedit climate savers computing initiative csci is an effort to reduce the electric power consumption of pcs in active and inactive states 11 the csci provides a catalog of green products from its member organizations and information for reducing pc power consumption it was started on 2007-06-12 the name stems from the world wildlife funds climate savers program which was launched in 1999 12 the wwf is also a member of the computing initiative 11 the green electronics council offers the electronic product environmental assessment tool epeat to assist in the purchase of greener computing systems the council evaluates computing equipment on 51 criteria - 23 required and 28 optional - that measure a products efficiency and sustainability attributes products are rated gold silver or bronze depending on how many optional criteria they meet on 2007-01-24 president george w bush issued executive order 13423 which requires all united states federal agencies to use epeat when purchasing computer systems 13 14 the green grid is a global consortium dedicated to advancing energy efficiency in data centers and business computing ecosystems it was founded in february 2007 by several key companies in the industry amd apc dell hp ibm intel microsoft rackable systems spraycool purchased in 2010 by parker sun microsystems and vmware the green grid has since grown to hundreds of members including end-users and government organizations all focused on improving data center infrastructure efficiency dcie the green500 list rates supercomputers by energy efficiency megaflopswatt encouraging a focus on efficiency rather than absolute performance green comm challenge is an organization that promotes the development of energy conservation technology and practices in the field of information and communications technology ict the transaction processing performance council tpc energy specification augments existing tpc benchmarks by allowing optional publications of energy metrics alongside performance results 15 specpower is the first industry standard benchmark that measures power consumption in relation to performance of satveer for server-class computers other benchmarks which measure energy efficiency include specweb specvirt 16 and vmmark 17 approachesedit in a 2008 article san murugesan defined green computing as the study and practice of designing manufacturing using and disposing of computers servers and associated subsystems  such as monitors printers storage devices and networking and communications systems  efficiently and effectively with minimal or no impact on the environment 1 murugesan lays out four paths along which he believes the environmental effects of computing should be addressed 1 green use green disposal green design and green manufacturing green computing can also develop solutions that offer benefits by aligning all it processes and practices with the core principles of sustainability which are to reduce reuse and recycle and finding innovative ways to use it in business processes to deliver sustainability benefits across the enterprise and beyond 18 modern it systems rely upon a complicated mix of people networks and hardware as such a green computing initiative must cover all of these areas as well a solution may also need to address end user satisfaction management restructuring regulatory compliance and return on investment roi there are also considerable fiscal motivations for companies to take control of their own power consumption of the power management tools available one of the most powerful may still be simple plain common sense 19 product longevityedit gartner maintains that the pc manufacturing process accounts for 70 of the natural resources used in the life cycle of a pc 20 more recently fujitsu released a life cycle assessment lca of a desktop that show that manufacturing and end of life accounts for the majority of this desktops ecological footprint 21 therefore the biggest contribution to green computing usually is to prolong the equipments lifetime another report from gartner recommends to look for product longevity including upgradability and modularity  22 for instance manufacturing a new pc makes a far bigger ecological footprint than manufacturing a new ram module to upgrade an existing one data center designedit data center facilities are heavy consumers of energy accounting for between 1.1 and 1.5 of the worlds total energy use in 2010  1 the us department of energy estimates that data center facilities consume up to 100 to 200 times more energy than standard office buildings 23 energy efficient data center design should address all of the energy use aspects included in a data center from the it equipment to the hvac equipment to the actual location configuration and construction of the building the us department of energy specifies five primary areas on which to focus energy efficient data center design best practices 24 information technology it systems environmental conditions air management cooling systems electrical systems additional energy efficient design opportunities specified by the us department of energy include on-site electrical generation and recycling of waste heat 23 25 energy efficient data center design should help to better utilize a data centers space and increase performance and efficiency software and deployment optimizationedit algorithmic efficiencyedit the efficiency of algorithms affects the amount of computer resources required for any given computing function and there are many efficiency trade-offs in writing programs algorithm changes such as switching from a slow eg linear search algorithm to a fast eg hashed or indexed search algorithm can reduce resource usage for a given task from substantial to close to zero in 2009 a study by a physicist at harvard estimated that the average google search released 7grams of carbon dioxide co 26 however google disputed this figure arguing instead that a typical search produced only 0.2grams of co 27 resource allocationedit algorithms can also be used to route data to data centers where electricity is less expensive researchers from mit carnegie mellon university and akamai have tested an energy allocation algorithm that successfully routes traffic to the location with the cheapest energy costs the researchers project up to a 40 percent savings on energy costs if their proposed algorithm were to be deployed however this approach does not actually reduce the amount of energy being used it reduces only the cost to the company using it nonetheless a similar strategy could be used to direct traffic to rely on energy that is produced in a more environmentally friendly or efficient way a similar approach has also been used to cut energy usage by routing traffic away from data centers experiencing warm weather this allows computers to be shut down to avoid using air conditioning 28 larger server centers are sometimes located where energy and land are inexpensive and readily available local availability of renewable energy climate that allows outside air to be used for cooling or locating them where the heat they produce may be used for other purposes could be factors in green siting decisions approaches to actually reduce the energy consumption of network devices by proper networkdevice management techniques are surveyed in 29 the authors grouped the approaches into 4 main strategies namely i adaptive link rate alr ii interface proxying iii energy aware infrastructure and iv energy aware applications virtualizingedit computer virtualization refers to the abstraction of computer resources such as the process of running two or more logical computer systems on one set of physical hardware the concept originated with the ibm mainframe operating systems of the 1960s but was commercialized for x86-compatible computers only in the 1990s with virtualization a system administrator could combine several physical systems into virtual machines on one single powerful system thereby unplugging the original hardware and reducing power and cooling consumption virtualization can assist in distributing work so that servers are either busy or put in a low-power sleep state several commercial companies and open-source projects now offer software packages to enable a transition to virtual computing intel corporation and amd have also built proprietary virtualization enhancements to the x86 instruction set into each of their cpu product lines in order to facilitate virtual computing terminal serversedit terminal servers have also been used in green computing when using the system users at a terminal connect to a central server all of the actual computing is done on the server but the end user experiences the operating system on the terminal these can be combined with thin clients which use up to 1/8 the amount of energy of a normal workstation resulting in a decrease of energy costs and consumptioncitation needed there has been an increase in using terminal services with thin clients to create virtual labs examples of terminal server software include terminal services for windows and the linux terminal server project ltsp for the linux operating system power managementedit the advanced configuration and power interface acpi an open industry standard allows an operating system to directly control the power-saving aspects of its underlying hardware this allows a system to automatically turn off components such as monitors and hard drives after set periods of inactivity in addition a system may hibernate when most components including the cpu and the system ram are turned off acpi is a successor to an earlier intel-microsoft standard called advanced power management which allows a computers bios to control power management functionscitation needed some programs allow the user to manually adjust the voltages supplied to the cpu which reduces both the amount of heat produced and electricity consumed this process is called undervolting some cpus can automatically undervolt the processor depending on the workload this technology is called speedstep on intel processors powernowcoolnquiet on amd chips longhaul on via cpus and longrun with transmeta processors data center poweredit data centers which have been criticized for their extraordinarily high energy demand are a primary focus for proponents of green computing 3 30 data centers can potentially improve their energy and space efficiency through techniques such as storage consolidation and virtualization many organizations are aiming to eliminate underutilized servers which results in lower energy usage 31 the first step toward this aim will be training of data center administrators 32 the us federal government has set a minimum 10 reduction target for data center energy usage by 2011 30 with the aid of a self-styled ultraefficient evaporative cooling technology google inc has been able to reduce its energy consumption to 50 of that of the industry average 30 operating system supportedit microsoft windows has included limited pc power management features since windows 95 33 these initially provided for stand-by suspend-to-ram and a monitor low power state further iterations of windows added hibernate suspend-to-disk and support for the acpi standard windows 2000 was the first nt-based operating system to include power management this required major changes to the underlying operating system architecture and a new hardware driver model windows 2000 also introduced group policy a technology that allowed administrators to centrally configure most windows features however power management was not one of those features this is probably because the power management settings design relied upon a connected set of per-user and per-machine binary registry values 34 effectively leaving it up to each user to configure their own power management settings this approach which is not compatible with windows group policy was repeated in windows xp the reasons for this design decision by microsoft are not known and it has resulted in heavy criticism 35 microsoft significantly improved this in windows vista 36 by redesigning the power management system to allow basic configuration by group policy the support offered is limited to a single per-computer policy the most recent release windows 7 retains these limitations but does include refinements for timer coalescing processor power management 37 38 and display panel brightness the most significant change in windows 7 is in the user experience the prominence of the default high performance power plan has been reduced with the aim of encouraging users to save power there is a significant market in third-party pc power management software offering features beyond those present in the windows operating system 39 40 41 available most products offer active directory integration and per-userper-machine settings with the more advanced offering multiple power plans scheduled power plans anti-insomnia features and enterprise power usage reporting notable vendors include 1e nightwatchman 42 43 data synergy powerman software 44 45 faronics power save 46 verdiem surveyor and enviprot auto shutdown manager 47 power supplyedit desktop computer power supplies are in general 70–75 efficient 48 dissipating the remaining energy as heat a certification program called 80 plus certifies psus that are at least 80 efficient typically these models are drop-in replacements for older less efficient psus of the same form factor as of july 20 2007 all new energy star 4.0-certified desktop psus must be at least 80 efficient 49 storageedit smaller form factor eg 2.5inch hard disk drives often consume less power per gigabyte than physically larger drives 50 51 unlike hard disk drives solid-state drives store data in flash memory or dram with no moving parts power consumption may be reduced somewhat for low-capacity flash-based devices 52 53 in a recent case study fusion-io manufacturer of solid state storage devices managed to reduce the energy use and operating costs of myspace data centers by 80 while increasing performance speeds beyond that which had been attainable via multiple hard disk drives in raid 0 54 55 in response myspace was able to retire several of their servers as hard drive prices have fallen storage farms have tended to increase in capacity to make more data available online this includes archival and backup data that would formerly have been saved on tape or other offline storage the increase in online storage has increased power consumption reducing the power consumed by large storage arrays while still providing the benefits of online storage is a subject of ongoing research 56 video cardedit a fast gpu may be the largest power consumer in a computer 57 energy-efficient display options include no video card - use a shared terminal shared thin client or desktop sharing software if display required use motherboard video output - typically low 3d performance and low power select a gpu based on low idle power average wattage or performance per watt displayedit crt monitors typically use more power than lcd monitors they also contain significant amounts of lead lcd monitors typically use a cold-cathode fluorescent bulb to provide light for the display some newer displays use an array of light-emitting diodes leds in place of the fluorescent bulb which reduces the amount of electricity used by the display 58 fluorescent back-lights also contain mercury whereas led back-lights do not materials recyclingedit recycling computing equipment can keep harmful materials such as lead mercury and hexavalent chromium out of landfills and can also replace equipment that otherwise would need to be manufactured saving further energy and emissions computer systems that have outlived their particular function can be re-purposed or donated to various charities and non-profit organizations 59 however many charities have recently imposed minimum system requirements for donated equipment 60 additionally parts from outdated systems may be salvaged and recycled through certain retail outlets 61 62 and municipal or private recycling centers computing supplies such as printer cartridges paper and batteries may be recycled as well 63 a drawback to many of these schemes is that computers gathered through recycling drives are often shipped to developing countries where environmental standards are less strict than in north america and europe 64 the silicon valley toxics coalition estimates that 80 of the post-consumer e-waste collected for recycling is shipped abroad to countries such as china and pakistan 65 in 2011 the collection rate of e-waste is still very low even in the most ecology-responsible countries like france in this country e-waste collection is still at a 14 annual rate between electronic equipment sold and e-waste collected for 2006 to 2009 66 the recycling of old computers raises an important privacy issue the old storage devices still hold private information such as emails passwords and credit card numbers which can be recovered simply by someones using software available freely on the internet deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from the hard drive before recycling a computer users should remove the hard drive or hard drives if there is more than one and physically destroy it or store it somewhere safe there are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling and they typically sign a non-disclosure agreement 67 cloud computingedit cloud computing addresses two major ict challenges related to green computing  energy usage and resource consumption virtualization dynamic provisioning environment multi-tenancy green data center approaches are enabling cloud computing to lower carbon emissions and energy usage up to a great extent large enterprises and small businesses can reduce their direct energy consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30 and 90 respectively by moving certain on-premises applications into the cloud 68 one common example includes online shopping that helps people purchase products and services over the internet without requiring them to drive and waste fuel to reach out to the physical shop which in turn reduces greenhouse gas emission related to travel 69 telecommutingedit teleconferencing and telepresence technologies are often implemented in green computing initiatives the advantages are many increased worker satisfaction reduction of greenhouse gas emissions related to travel and increased profit margins as a result of lower overhead costs for office space heat lighting etc 70 the savings are significant the average annual energy consumption for us office buildings is over 23 kilowatt hours per square foot with heat air conditioning and lighting accounting for 70 of all energy consumed 71 other related initiatives such as hoteling reduce the square footage per employee as workers reserve space only when they need it 72 many types of jobs such as sales consulting and field service integrate well with this technique voice over ip voip reduces the telephony wiring infrastructure by sharing the existing ethernet copper voip and phone extension mobility also made hot desking more practical telecommunication network devices energy indicesedit the information and communication technologies icts energy consumption in the usa and worldwide has been estimated respectively at 9.4 and 5.3 of the total electricity produced 73 the energy consumption of icts is today significant even when compared with other industries some study tried to identify the key energy indices that allow a relevant comparison between different devices network elements 74 this analysis was focused on how to optimise device and network consumption for carrier telecommunication by itself the target was to allow an immediate perception of the relationship between the network technology and the environmental effect these studies are at the start and the gap to fill in this sector is still huge and further research will be necessary supercomputersedit the inaugural green500 list was announced on november 15 2007 at
