renewable energy in portugal renewable energy in portugal was the source for 25.7 of energy consumption in 2013  1 in 2014 63 of portugals electricity needs were supplied by renewable sources  2 in 2015 50.4 of power produced in portugal came from renewable sources the decrease from the year before was caused by lower productivity in the hydroelectric sector because of a dry year 3 in 2001 the portuguese government launched a new energy policy instrument  the e4 programme energy efficiency and endogenous energies consisting of a set of multiple diversified measures aimed at promoting a consistent integrated approach to energy supply and demand by promoting energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy endogenous sources the programme sought to upgrade the competitiveness of the portuguese economy and to modernize the countrys social fabric while preserving the environment by reducing gas emissions especially the carbon dioxide 4 while from 2002-2007 the main priorities were focused on the introduction of natural gas aiming at progressively replacing oil and coal in the energy balance and liberalization of the energy market by opening this former state-owned sector to competition and private investment the emphasis shifted for the next 5 years was on energy efficiency supply and demand sides and use of endogenous renewable energy 4 during february 2016 an equivalent to 95 of electricity consumed in portugal was produced by renewable sources such as biomass hydropower wind power and solar power a total of 4139 gwh was produced by these sources 5 in may 2016 all of portugals electricity was produced renewably for a period of over four days a landmark achievement for a modern european country 6  contents 1 hydro power 2 wind power 3 solar power 4

has about 100 small hydro systems with a capacity of 256 mw which produce 815 gwhyear 7 wind poweredit from march 2007 to december 2010 wind power nameplate capacity grew from 1,874 to 3,937 mw in excluding madeira and azores portugal the major wind turbine manufacturers in the portuguese market are enercon vestas and gamesa 8 the 240 mw alto minho wind farm in the viana do castelo district became fully operational in november 2008 9 at the time of completion it was europes largest on-shore wind farm 10 other major wind farms which are operating or under construction include arada-montemuro wind farm  112 mw gardunha wind farm  106 mw pinhal interior wind farm  144 mw and ventominho wind farm  240 mw portugal combines wind and hydropower by using nighttime winds to pump water uphill and sending the water back through generators to produce power the next day the so-called pumped-storage hydroelectricity 11 solar poweredit a large photovoltaic power project the serpa solar power plant was completed in portugal one of europes sunniest areas 12 the 11 megawatt plant covered 150 acres  0.61km2 and employs 52,000 pv panels the panels are raised 2 metres off the ground allowing grazing to continue the plant provides enough energy for 8,000 homes and saves an estimated 30,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year 13 14 not far from there moura photovoltaic power station is under construction with more than 376,000 solar modules it will have an installed capacity of 62mwp when finished the first stage of construction is scheduled for completion in 2008 a solar panel factory is also being built in the city of moura where there are plans to build a research labcitation needed geothermal poweredit portugals main investment for the use of this type of energy is in the azores small scale use of this energy source began in the 1980s in chaves and s pedro do sul continental portugal providing 3 mwt in the azores the use of geothermal energy is widespread with production in 8 of the 9 islands collectively producing some 235.5 mwt in 2003 25 of the electricity consumed in são miguel was produced by geothermal energy 1 wave poweredit aguçadoura wave farm was the worlds first commercial wave farm when it opened on 23 september 2008 it was located three miles  5km offshore near póvoa de varzim north of porto the farm used three pelamis wave energy converters to convert the motion of the ocean surface waves into electricity 15 16 the wave farm was shut down in november 2008 just over two months after the official opening 17 18 biogasedit in 2011 portugal produced 45 ktoe kiloton of oil equivalent of biogas 19 see alsoedit portugal portal renewable energy portal list of renewable energy topics by country renewable energy
