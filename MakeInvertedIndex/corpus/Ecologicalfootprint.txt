ecological footprint an ecological footprint is a measure of human impact on earths ecosystems its typically measured in area of wilderness or amount of natural capital consumed each year a common way of estimating footprint is the area of wilderness of both land and sea needed to supply resources to a human population this includes the area of wilderness needed to assimilate human waste at a global scale it is used to estimate how rapidly we are depleting natural capital the global footprint network calculates the global ecological footprint from un and other data they estimate that as of 2007 our planet has been using natural capital 1.5 times as fast as nature can renew it  contents 1 footprint measurements 2 overview 3 methodology 4 studies in the united kingdom 5 critiques 6 footprint by country 7 implications 8 see also 9 further reading 10 references 11 external links  footprint measurementsedit in 2007 the global footprint network estimated the global ecological footprint as 1.6 planet earths that is they judged that ecological services were being used 1.6 times as quickly as they were being renewed 1 ecological footprints can be calculated at any scale for an activity a person a community a city a region a nation or humanity as a whole cities due to population concentration have large ecological footprints and have become ground zero for footprint reduction 2 global footprints currently there is no fixed way to measure global footprints and any attempts to describe the capacity of an ecosystem in a single number is a massive simplification of thousands of key renewable resources which are not used or replenished at the same rate however there has been some convergence of metrics and standards since 2006 3 city ecological footprints are being measured there are two types of measurements in use the first measures ecosystem displacement which is defined as city area minus remaining green spaces this is an area measurement that does not include human or other biological activity the second attempts to quantify surviving ecosystem health specifically it attempts to quantify both area and biological health of ecosystems surviving inside city areas such as nature reserves parks other green spaces city footprints are being calculated and ranked with city ecological indexes 4 overviewedit the first academic publication about ecological footprints was by william rees in 1992 5 the ecological footprint concept and calculation method was developed as the phd dissertation of mathis wackernagel under rees supervision at the university of british columbia in vancouver canada from 1990–1994 6 originally wackernagel and rees called the concept appropriated carrying capacity 7 to make the idea more accessible rees came up with the term ecological footprint inspired by a computer technician who praised his new computers small footprint on the desk 8 in early 1996 wackernagel and rees published the book our ecological footprint reducing human impact on the earth with illustrations by phil testemale 9 footprint values at the end of a survey are categorized for carbon food housing and goods and services as well as the total footprint number of earths needed to sustain the worlds population at that level of consumption this approach can also be applied to an activity such as the manufacturing of a product or driving of a car this resource accounting is similar to life-cycle analysis wherein the consumption of energy biomass food fiber building material water and other resources are converted into a normalized measure of land area called global hectares gha per capita ecological footprint ef or ecological footprint analysis efa is a means of comparing consumption and lifestyles and checking this against natures ability to provide for this consumption the tool can inform policy by examining to what extent a nation uses more or less than is available within its territory or to what extent the nations lifestyle would be replicable worldwide the footprint can also be a useful tool to educate people about carrying capacity and overconsumption with the aim of altering personal behavior ecological footprints may be used to argue that many current lifestyles are not sustainable such a global comparison also clearly shows the inequalities of resource use on this planet at the beginning of the twenty-first century in 2007 the average biologically productive area per person worldwide was approximately 1.8 global hectares gha per capita the us footprint per capita was 9.0 gha and that of switzerland was 5.6 gha while chinas was 1.8 gha 10 11 the wwf claims that the human footprint has exceeded the biocapacity the available supply of natural resources of the planet by 20 12 wackernagel and rees originally estimated that the available biological capacity for the 6 billion people on earth at that time was about 1.3 hectares per person which is smaller than the 1.8 global hectares published for 2006 because the initial studies neither used global hectares nor included bioproductive marine areas 9 a number of ngos offer ecological footprint calculators see footprint calculator below ecological footprint analysis is now widely used around the earth as an indicator of environmental sustainability 13 it can be used to measure and manage the use of resources throughout the economy it can be used to explore the sustainability of individual lifestyles goods and services organizations industry sectors neighborhoods cities regions and nations 14 since 2006 a first set of ecological footprint standards exist that detail both communication and calculation procedures methodologyedit the ecological footprint accounting method at the national level is described in the l footprint atlas 2010 15 or in greater detail in the calculation methodology for the national footprint accounts 16 the national accounts review committee has also published a research agenda on how the method will be improved 17 in 2003 jason venetoulis carl mas christopher gaudet dahlia chazan and john talberth developed footprint 2 which offers a series of theoretical and methodological improvements to the standard footprint approach the four primary improvements were that they included the entire surface of the earth in biocapacity estimates allocated space for other ie non-human species updated the basis of equivalence factors from agricultural land to net primary productivity npp and refined the carbon component of the footprint based on the latest global carbon models 18 19 studies in the united kingdomedit the uks average ecological footprint is 5.45 global hectares per capita gha with variations between regions ranging from 4.80 gha wales to 5.56 gha east england 11 two recent studiescitation needed have examined relatively low-impact small communities bedzed a 96-home mixed-income housing development in south london was designed by bill dunster architects and sustainability consultants bioregional for the peabody trust despite being populated by relatively mainstream home-buyers bedzed was found to have a footprint of 3.20 gha due to on-site renewable energy production energy-efficient architecture and an extensive green lifestyles program that included on-site londons first carsharing club the report did not measure the added footprint of the 15,000 visitors who have toured bedzed since its completion in 2002 findhorn ecovillage a rural intentional community in moray scotland had a total footprint of 2.56 gha including both the many guests and visitors who travel to the community to undertake residential courses there and the nearby campus of cluny hill college however the residents alone have a footprint of 2.71 gha a little over half the uk national average and one of the lowest ecological footprints of any community measured so far in the industrialized world 20 21 keveral farm an organic farming community in cornwall was found to have a footprint of 2.4 gha though with substantial differences in footprints among community members 22 critiquesedit early criticism was published by van den bergh and verbruggen in 1999 23 which was updated in 2014 24 another criticism was published in 2008 25 a more complete review commissioned by the directorate-general for the environment european commission was published in june 2008 26 a recent critique of the concept is due to blomqvist et al 2013a 27 with a reply from rees and wackernagel 2013 28 and a rejoinder by blomqvist et al 2013b 29 an additional strand of critique is due to giampietro and saltelli  2014a 30 with a reply from goldfinger et al 2014 31 a rejoinder by giampietro and saltelli  2014a 32 and additional comments from van den bergh and grazi  2015 33 a number of countries have engaged in research collaborations to test the validity of the method this includes switzerland germany united arab emirates and belgium 34 grazi et al  2007 have performed a systematic comparison of the ecological footprint method with spatial welfare analysis that includes environmental externalities agglomeration effects and trade advantages 35 they find that the two methods can lead to very distinct and even opposite rankings of different spatial patterns of economic activity however this should not be surprising since the two methods address different research questions calculating the ecological footprint for densely populated areas such as a city or small country with a comparatively large population  eg new york and singapore respectively  may lead to the perception of these populations as parasitic this is because these communities have little intrinsic biocapacity and instead must rely upon large hinterlands critics argue that this is a dubious characterization since mechanized rural farmers in developed nations may easily consume more resources than urban inhabitants due to transportation requirements and the unavailability of economies of scale furthermore such moral conclusions seem to be an argument for autarky some even take this train of thought a step further claiming that the footprint denies the benefits of trade therefore the critics argue that the footprint can only be applied globally 36 the method seems to reward the replacement of original ecosystems with high-productivity agricultural monocultures by assigning a higher biocapacity to such regions for example replacing ancient woodlands or tropical forests with monoculture forests or plantations may improve the ecological footprint similarly if organic farming yields were lower than those of conventional methods this could result in the former being penalized with a larger ecological footprint 37 of course this insight while valid stems from the idea of using the footprint as ones only metric if the use of ecological footprints are complemented with other indicators such as one for biodiversity the problem could maybe be solved indeed wwfs living planet report complements the biennial footprint calculations with the living planet index of biodiversity 38 manfred lenzen and shauna murray have created a modified ecological footprint that takes biodiversity into account for use in australia 39 although the ecological footprint model prior to 2008 treated nuclear power in the same manner as coal power 40 the actual real world effects of the two are radically different a life cycle analysis centered on the swedish forsmark nuclear power plant estimated carbon dioxide emissions at 3.10 gkwh 41 and 5.05 gkwh in 2002 for the torness nuclear power station 42 this compares to 11 gkwh for hydroelectric power 950 gkwh for installed coal 900 gkwh for oil and 600 gkwh for natural gas generation in the united states in 1999 43 figures released by mark hertsgaard however show that because of the delays in building nuclear plants and the costs involved investments in energy efficiency and renewable energies have seven times the return on investment of investments in nuclear energy 44 the swedish utility vattenfall did a study of full life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources the utility uses to produce electricity namely nuclear hydro coal gas solar cell peat and wind the net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3grams of carbon dioxide per kw-hr of produced power this compares to 400 for natural gas and 700 for coal according to this study the study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of co2 of any of their electricity sources 45 claims exist that the problems of nuclear waste do not come anywhere close to approaching the problems of fossil fuel waste 46 47 a 2004 article from the bbc states the world health organization who says 3 million people are killed worldwide by outdoor air pollution annually from vehicles and industrial emissions and 1.6 million indoors through using solid fuel 48 in the us alone fossil fuel waste kills 20,000 people each year 49 a coal power plant releases 100 times as much radiation as a nuclear power plant of the same wattage 50 it is estimated that during 1982 us coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the three mile island incident 51 in addition fossil fuel waste causes global warming which leads to increased deaths from hurricanes flooding and other weather events the world nuclear association provides a comparison of deaths due to accidents among different forms of energy production in their comparison deaths per tw-yr of electricity produced in uk and usa from 1970 to 1992 are quoted as 885 for hydropower 342 for coal 85 for natural gas and 8 for nuclear 52 the western australian government state of the environment report included an ecological footprint measure for the average western australian seven times the average footprint per person on the planet in 2007 a total of about 15 hectares 53 footprint by countryedit the world-average ecological footprint in 2012 was 1.8 global hectares per person the average per country ranges from over 10 to under 1 hectares per person there is also a high variation within countries based on individual lifestyle and economic situation 54 the ghg footprint differs from the ecological footprint in that the former is expressed in units of ghg warming potential ggwp and is generated by products or services whereas the latter is expressed in units of land area and is generated by whole societies 55 implicationsedit    the average world citizen has an eco-footprint of about 2.7 global average hectares while there are only 2.1 global hectare of bioproductive land and water per capita on earth this means that humanity has already overshot global biocapacity by 30 and now lives unsustainabily by depleting stocks of natural capital 56 see alsoedit environment portal ecology portal carbon footprint dependency theory ecological debt day ecological economics ecosystem valuation
