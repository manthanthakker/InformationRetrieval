flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion refers to the combustion-product gas resulting from the burning of fossil fuels 1 most fossil fuels are combusted with ambient air as differentiated from combustion with pure oxygen since ambient air contains about 79 volume percent gaseous nitrogen n2 2 which is essentially non-combustible the largest part of the flue gas from most fossil-fuel combustion is uncombusted nitrogen carbon dioxide co2 the next largest part of flue gas can be as much as 10âˆ’25 volume percent or more of the flue gas this is closely followed in volume by water vapor h2o created by the combustion of the hydrogen in the fuel with atmospheric oxygen much of the smoke seen pouring from flue gas stacks is this water vapor forming a cloud as it contacts cool air a typical flue gas from the combustion of fossil fuels contains very small amounts of nitrogen oxides nox sulfur dioxide so2 and particulate matter 1 the nitrogen oxides are derived from the nitrogen in the ambient air as well as from any nitrogen-containing compounds in the fossil fuel the sulfur dioxide is derived from any sulfur-containing compounds in the fuels the particulate matter is composed of very small particles of solid materials and very small liquid droplets which give flue gases their smoky appearance the steam generators in large power plants and the process furnaces in large refineries petrochemical and chemical plants and incinerators burn considerable amounts of fossil fuels and therefore emit large amounts of flue gas to the ambient atmosphere the table below presents the total amounts of flue gas typically generated by the burning of fossil fuels such as natural gas fuel oil and coal the data were obtained by stoichiometric 3 calculations 4 it is of interest to note that the total amount of flue gas generated by coal combustion is only 10 percent higher than the flue gas generated by natural-gas combustion see alsoedit ap 42 compilation of air pollutant emission factors emission standard flue-gas stack flue gas flue-gas desulfurization gas stoichiometry stoichiometry referencesedit external linksedit article on flue gas treatment including desulfurization and the removal of hydrogen chloride sulphur trioxide and mercury
