population growth in biology population growth is the increase in the number of individuals in a population global human population growth amounts to around 75 million annually or 1.1 per year the global population has grown from 1 billion in 1800 to 7 billion in 2012 it is expected to keep growing and estimates have put the total population at 8.4 billion by mid-2030 and 9.6 billion by mid-2050 many nations with rapid population growth have low standards of living whereas many nations with low rates of population growth have high standards of living 1  contents 1 population growth

number of individuals in a population increases in a given time period expressed as a fraction of the initial population specifically population growth rate refers to the change in population over a unit time period often expressed as a percentage of the number of individuals in the population at the beginning of that period this can be written as the formula valid for a sufficiently small time interval a positive growth rate indicates that the population is increasing while a negative growth rate indicates that the population is decreasing a growth ratio of zero indicates that there were the same number of individuals at the beginning and end of the perioda growth rate may be zero even when there are significant changes in the birth rates death rates immigration rates and age distribution between the two times 3 a related measure is the net reproduction rate in the absence of migration a net reproduction rate of more than 1 indicates that the population of females is increasing while a net reproduction rate less than one sub-replacement fertility indicates that the population of females is decreasing human population growth rateedit in 2009 the estimated annual growth rate was 1.1 4 the cia world factbook gives the world annual birthrate mortality rate and growth rate as 1.86 0.78 and 1.08 respectively 5 the last 100years have seen a massive fourfold increase in the population due to medical advances lower mortality rates and an increase in agricultural productivity 6 made possible by the green revolution the annual increase in the number of living humans peaked at 88.0million in 1989 then slowly declined to 73.9million in 2003 after which it rose again to 75.2million in 2006 in 2009 the human population increased by 74.6million 4 generally developed nations have seen a decline in their growth rates in recent decades though annual growth rates remain above 2 in poverty-stricken countries of the middle east and sub-saharan africa and also in south asia southeast asia and latin america 7 in some countries the population is declining especially in eastern europe mainly due to low fertility rates high death rates and emigration in southern africa growth is slowing due to the high number of aids-related deaths some western europe countries might also experience population decline 8 japans population began decreasing in 2005 it now has the highest standard of living in the world 9 the united nations population division projects world population to peak at over 10billion at the end of the 21st century but sanjeev sanyal has argued that global fertility will fall below the replacement rate in the 2020s and that world population will peak below 9billion by 2050 followed by a long decline 10 growth by countryedit according to united nations population statistics the world population grew by 30 or 1.6billion humans between 1990 and 2010 11 in number of people the increase was highest in india  350million and china  196million population growth was among highest in the united arab emirates  315 and qatar  271 11 into the futureedit according to the uns 2010 revision to its population projections world population is projected to peak at 10.1 billion in 2100 compared to 7 billion in 2011 69 a 2014 paper by demographers from several universities and the united nations population division projected that the worlds population would reach about 10.9 billion in 2100 and continue growing thereafter 70 however some experts dispute the uns figures and have argued that birth rates will fall below replacement rate in the 2020s according to their projections population growth will be only sustained till the 2040s by rising longevity but will peak below 9 bn by 2050 10 see
