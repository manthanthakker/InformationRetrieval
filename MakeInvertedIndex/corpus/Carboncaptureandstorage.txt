carbon capture and storage carbon capture and storage ccs or carbon capture and sequestration is the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide co2 from large point sources such as fossil fuel power plants transporting it to a storage site and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere normally an underground geological formation the aim is to prevent the release of large quantities of co2 into the atmosphere from fossil fuel use in power generation and other industries it is a potential means of mitigating the contribution of fossil fuel emissions to global warming 1 and ocean acidification 2 although co2 has been injected into geological formations for several decades for various purposes including enhanced oil recovery the long term storage of co2 is a relatively new concept the first commercial example was the weyburn-midale carbon dioxide project in 2000 3 other examples include saskpowers boundary dam and mississippi powers kemper project ccs can also be used to describe the scrubbing of co2 from ambient air as a climate engineering technique an integrated pilot-scale ccs power plant was to begin operating in september 2008 in the eastern german power plant schwarze pumpe run by utility vattenfall to test the technological feasibility and economic efficiency ccs applied to a modern conventional power plant could reduce co2 emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80–90 compared to a plant without ccs 4 the ipcc estimates that the economic potential of ccs could be between 10 and 55 of the total carbon mitigation effort until year 2100 4 carbon dioxide can be captured out of air or fossil fuel power plant flue gas using absorption or carbon scrubbing membrane gas separation or adsorption technologies amines are the leading carbon scrubbing technology capturing and compressing co2 may increase the energy needs of a coal-fired ccs plant by 25–40 4 these and other system costs are estimated to increase the cost per watt energy produced by 21–91 for fossil fuel power plants 4 applying the technology to existing plants would be more expensive especially if they are far from a sequestration site a 2005 industry report suggests that with successful research development and deployment rdd sequestered coal-based electricity generation in 2025 may cost less than unsequestered coal-based electricity generation today 5 storage of the co2 is envisaged either in deep geological formations or in the form of mineral carbonates deep ocean storage is not currently considered feasible due to the associated effect of ocean acidification 6 geological formations are currently considered the most promising sequestration sites the national energy technology laboratory netl reported that north america has enough storage capacity for more than 900 years worth of carbon dioxide at current production rates 7 a general problem is that long term predictions about submarine or underground storage security are very difficult and uncertain and there is still the risk that co2 might leak into the atmosphere 8  contents 1 capture 1.1 capture technologies 2 transport 3 sequestration 3.1 geological storage 3.1.1

at point sources such as large fossil fuel or biomass energy facilities industries with major co2 emissions natural gas processing synthetic fuel plants and fossil fuel-based hydrogen production plants extracting co2 from air is also possible but not very practical because the co2 is not concentrated 9 organisms that produce ethanol by fermentation generate cool essentially pure co2 that can be pumped underground 10 fermentation produces slightly less co2 than ethanol by weight flue gas from the combustion of coal in oxygen has a large concentration of co2 about 10-15 co2 whereas natural gas power plant flue gas is about 5-10 co2 11 therefore it is more energy and cost efficient to capture co2 from coal-fired power plants impurities in co2 streams like sulfurs and water could have a significant effect on their phase behaviour and could pose a significant threat of increased corrosion of pipeline and well materials 10 in instances where co2 impurities exist especially with air capture a scrubbing separation process would be needed to initially clean the flue gas 12 according to the wallula energy resource center in washington state by gasifying coal it is possible to capture approximately 65 of carbon dioxide embedded in it and sequester it in a solid form 13 broadly three different configurations of technologies for capture exist post-combustion pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion in post combustion capture the co2 is removed after combustion of the fossil fuel this is the scheme that would be applied to fossil-fuel burning power plants here carbon dioxide is captured from flue gases at power stations or other large point sources the technology is well understood and is currently used in other industrial applications although not at the same scale as might be required in a commercial scale power station post combustion capture is most popular in research because existing fossil fuel power plants can be retrofitted to include ccs technology in this configuration 14 the technology for pre-combustion is widely applied in fertilizer chemical gaseous fuel h2 ch4 and power production 15 in these cases the fossil fuel is partially oxidized for instance in a gasifier the resulting syngas co and h2 is shifted into co2 and h2 the resulting co2 can be captured from a relatively pure exhaust stream the h2 can now be used as fuel the carbon dioxide is removed before combustion takes place there are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon dioxide capture 16 17 the co2 is removed after combustion of fossil fuels but before the flue gas is expanded to atmospheric pressure this scheme is applied to new fossil fuel burning power plants or to existing plants where re-powering is an option the capture before expansion ie from pressurized gas is standard in almost all industrial co2 capture processes at the same scale as will be required for utility power plants 18 19 in oxy-fuel combustion 20 the fuel is burned in oxygen instead of air to limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion cooled flue gas is recirculated and injected into the combustion chamber the flue gas consists of mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour the latter of which is condensed through cooling the result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site and stored power plant processes based on oxyfuel combustion are sometimes referred to as zero emission cycles because the co2 stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas stream as in the cases of pre- and post-combustion capture but the flue gas stream itself a certain fraction of the co2 generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed water to warrant the label zero emission the water would thus have to be treated or disposed of appropriately the technique is promising but the initial air separation step demands a lot of energy capture technologiesedit carbon dioxide can be separated out of air or flue gas with absorption adsorption or membrane gas separation technologies absorption or carbon scrubbing with amines is currently the dominant capture technology membrane and adsorption technologies are still in the developmental research stages initiating primary pilot plants in the near future metal-organic frameworks mofs are a novel class of materials that offer promise for carbon capture using adsorption technologies carbon dioxide adsorbs to a mof through physisorption or chemisorption based on the porosity and selectivity of the mof leaving behind a greenhouse gas poor gas stream that is more environmentally friendly the carbon dioxide is then stripped off the mof using temperature swing adsorption tsa or pressure swing adsorption psa so the mof can be reused adsorbents and absorbents require regeneration steps where the co2 is removed from the sorbent or solution that collected it out of the flue gas in order for the sorbent or solution to be reused monoethanolamine mea solutions the leading amine for capturing co2 have a heat capacity between 3-4 jg k since they are mostly water 21 22 higher heat capacities add to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step thus to optimize a mof for carbon capture low heat capacities and heats of adsorption are desired additionally high working capacity and high selectivity are desirable in order to capture as much co2 as possible from the flue gas however there is an energy trade off with selectivity and energy expenditure 23 as the amount of co2 captured increases the energy and therefore cost required to regenerate increases a large drawback of using mofs for ccs is the limitations imposed by their chemical and thermal stability 24 current research is looking to optimize mof properties for ccs but it has proven difficult to find these optimizations that also result in a stable mof metal reservoirs are also a limiting factor to the potential success of mofs 25 capture is attributed to about two thirds of the total cost of ccs making it limit the wide-scale deployment of ccs technologies to optimize a co2 capture process would significantly increase the feasibility of ccs since the transport and storage steps of ccs are rather mature technologies 11 an alternate method under development is chemical looping combustion clc chemical looping uses a metal oxide as a solid oxygen carrier metal oxide particles react with a solid liquid or gaseous fuel in a fluidized bed combustor producing solid metal particles and a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor the water vapor is condensed leaving pure carbon dioxide which can then be sequestered the solid metal particles are circulated to another fluidized bed where they react with air producing heat and regenerating metal oxide particles that are recirculated to the fluidized bed combustor a variant of chemical looping is calcium looping which uses the alternating carbonation and then calcination of a calcium oxide based carrier as a means of capturing co2 26 a few engineering proposals have been made for the more difficult task of removing co2 from the atmosphere  a form of climate engineering  but work in this area is still in its infancy capture costs are estimated to be higher than from point sources but may be feasible for dealing with emissions from diffuse sources such as automobiles and aircraft 27 the theoretically required energy for air capture is only slightly more than for capture from point sources the additional costs come from the devices that use the natural air flow global research technologies demonstrated a pre-prototype of air capture technology in 2007 28 transportedit after capture the co2 would have to be transported to suitable storage sites this would most likely be done by pipeline which is generally the cheapest form of transport in 2008 there were approximately 5,800km of co2 pipelines in the united states used to transport co2 to oil production fields where it is then injected into older fields to extract oil the injection of co2 to produce oil is generally called enhanced oil recovery or eorcitation needed in addition there are several pilot programs in various stages to test the long-term storage of co2 in non-oil producing geologic formations according to the congressional research service there are important unanswered questions about pipeline network requirements economic regulation utility cost recovery regulatory classification of co2 itself and pipeline safety furthermore because co2 pipelines for enhanced oil recovery are already in use today policy decisions affecting co2 pipelines take on an urgency that is unrecognized by many federal classification of co2 as both a commodity by the bureau of land management and as a pollutant by the environmental protection agency could potentially create an immediate conflict which may need to be addressed not only for the sake of future ccs implementation but also to ensure consistency of future ccs with co2 pipeline operations today 29 30 ships could also be utilized for transport where pipelines are not feasible these methods are currently used for transporting co2 for other applications sequestrationedit various forms have been conceived for permanent storage of co2 these forms include gaseous storage in various deep geological formations including saline formations and exhausted gas fields and solid storage by reaction of co2 with metal oxides to produce stable carbonates geological storageedit also known as geo-sequestration this method involves injecting carbon dioxide generally in supercritical form directly into underground geological formations oil fields gas fields saline formations unmineable coal seams and saline-filled basalt formations have been suggested as storage sites various physical eg highly impermeable caprock and geochemical trapping mechanisms would prevent the co2 from escaping to the surface 31 co2 is sometimes injected into declining oil fields to increase oil recovery approximately 30 to 50 million metric tonnes of co2 are injected annually in the united states into declining oil fields 32 this option is attractive because the geology of hydrocarbon reservoirs is generally well understood and storage costs may be partly offset by the sale of additional oil that is recovered 33 disadvantages of old oil fields are their geographic distribution and their limited capacity as well as the fact that subsequent burning of the additional oil recovered will offset much or all of the reduction in co2 emissions 34 unmineable coal seams can be used to store co2 because the co2 molecules attach to the surface of coal the technical feasibility however depends on the permeability of the coal bed in the process of absorption the coal releases previously absorbed methane and the methane can be recovered enhanced coal bed methane recovery the sale of the methane can be used to offset a portion of the cost of the co2 storage burning the resultant methane however would negate some of the benefit of sequestering the original co2 saline formations contain highly mineralized brines and have so far been considered of no benefit to humans saline aquifers have been used for storage of chemical waste in a few cases the main advantage of saline aquifers is their large potential storage volume and their common occurrence the major disadvantage of saline aquifers is that relatively little is known about them especially compared to oil fields to keep the cost of storage acceptable the geophysical exploration may be limited resulting in larger uncertainty about the aquifer structure unlike storage in oil fields or coal beds no side product will offset the storage cost leakage of co2 back into the atmosphere may be a problem in saline aquifer storage current research shows however that trapping mechanisms such as structural trapping residual trapping solubility trapping and mineral trapping could immobilize the co2 underground and reduce the risk of leakage 31 enhanced oil recoveryedit enhanced oil recovery eor is a generic term for techniques used to increase the amount of crude oil that can be extracted from an oil field in carbon capture  sequestration enhanced oil recovery ccs eor carbon dioxide is injected into an oil field to recover oil that is often never recovered using more traditional methods crude oil development and production in us oil reservoirs can include up to three distinct phases primary secondary and tertiary or enhanced recovery 35 during primary recovery only about 10 percent of a reservoirs original oil in place is typically produced secondary recovery techniques extend a fields productive life generally by injecting water or gas to displace oil and drive it to a production wellbore resulting in the recovery of 20 to 40 percent of the original oil in place however with much of the easy-to-produce oil already recovered from us oil fields producers have attempted several tertiary or enhanced oil recovery eor techniques that offer prospects for ultimately producing 30 to 60 percent or more of the reservoirs original oil in place 36 an example of a project that will use ccs eor is the kemper project in mississippi due to the kemper projects close proximity to oil fields the carbon dioxide byproduct from producing electricity will be transported to the neighboring oil fields for eor 37 ocean storageedit in the past it was suggested that co2 could be stored in the oceans but this would only exacerbate ocean acidification and has been made illegal under specific regulations ocean storage is no longer considered feasible 6 mineral storageedit in this process co2 is exothermically reacted with available metal oxides which in turn produces stable carbonates eg calcite magnesite this process occurs naturally over many years and is responsible for a great amount of surface limestone the idea of using olivine has been promoted by the geochemist prof schuiling 38 the reaction rate can be made faster for example with a catalyst 39 or by reacting at higher temperatures andor pressures or by pre-treatment of the minerals although this method can require additional energy the ipcc estimates that a power plant equipped with ccs using mineral storage will need 60–180 more energy than a power plant without ccs 4 the economics of mineral carbonation at scale are now being tested in a world-first pilot plant project based in newcastle australia new techniques for mineral activation and reaction have been developed the greenmag group and the university of newcastle and funded by the new south wales and australian governments to be operational by 2013 40 in 2009 it was reported that scientists had mapped 6,000 square miles  16,000km2 of rock formations in the us that could be used to store 500 years worth of us carbon dioxide emissions 41 a study on mineral sequestration in the us states carbon sequestration by reacting naturally occurring mg and ca containing minerals with co2 to form carbonates has many unique advantages most notable is the fact that carbonates have a lower energy state than co2 which is why mineral carbonation is thermodynamically favorable and occurs naturally eg the weathering of rock over geologic time periods secondly the raw materials such as magnesium based minerals are abundant finally the produced carbonates are unarguably stable and thus re-release of co2 into the atmosphere is not an issue however conventional carbonation pathways are slow under ambient temperatures and pressures the significant challenge being addressed by this effort is to identify an industrially and environmentally viable carbonation route that will allow mineral sequestration to be implemented with acceptable economics 42 the following table lists principal metal oxides of earths crust theoretically up to 22 of this mineral mass is able to form carbonates ultramafic mine tailings are a readily available source of fine-grained metal oxides that can act as artificial carbon sinks to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions in the mining industry 43 accelerating passive co2 sequestration via mineral carbonation may be achieved through microbial processes that enhance mineral dissolution and carbonate precipitation 44 45 46 energy requirementsedit the energy requirements of sequestration processes may be significant in one paper sequestration consumed 25 percent of the plants rated 600-megawatt output capacity 47 leakageedit a major concern with ccs is whether leakage of stored co2 will compromise ccs as a climate change mitigation option for well-selected designed and managed geological storage sites ipcc estimates that risks are comparable to those associated with current hydrocarbon activity 48 however this finding is contested due to a lack of experience in such long term storage 49 50 co2 could be trapped for millions of years and although some leakage occurs upwards through the soil well selected storage sites are likely to retain over 99 of the injected co2 over 1000 years 51 leakage through the injection pipe is a greater risk 52 although the injection pipe is usually protected with non-return valves to prevent release on a power outage there is still a risk that the pipe itself could tear and leak due to the pressure the berkel en rodenrijs incident in december 2008 was an example where a modest release of co2 from a pipeline under a bridge resulted in the deaths of some ducks sheltering there 53 in order to measure accidental carbon releases more accurately and decrease the risk of fatalities through this type of leakage the implementation of co2 alert meters around the project perimeter has been proposed malfunction of a carbon dioxide industrial fire suppression system in a large warehouse released co2 and 14 citizens collapsed on the nearby public road a release of co2 from a salt mine killed a person at distance of 300 meters 54 in 1986 a large leakage of naturally sequestered co2 rose from lake nyos in cameroon and asphyxiated 1,700 people while the carbon had been sequestered naturally some point to the event as evidence for the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestering carbon artificially 55 the lake nyos disaster resulted from a volcanic event which very suddenly released as much as a cubic kilometre of co2 gas from a pool of naturally occurring co2 under the lake in a deep narrow valley the location of this pool of co2 is not a place where man can inject or store co2 and this pool was not known about nor monitored until after the occurrence of the natural disaster for ocean storage the retention of co2 would depend on the depth the ipcc estimates 30–85 of the sequestered carbon dioxide would be retained after 500 years for depths 1000–3000 m mineral storage is not regarded as having any risks of leakage the ipcc recommends that limits be set to the amount of leakage that can take place this might rule out deep ocean storage as an option at the conditions of the deeper oceans about 400 bar or 40 mpa 280 k waterco2l mixing is very low where carbonate formationacidification is the rate limiting step but the formation of water-co2 hydrates a kind of solid water cage that surrounds the co2 is favorable to further investigate the safety of co2 sequestration norways sleipner gas field can be studied as it is the oldest plant that stores co2 on an industrial scale according to an environmental assessment of the gas field which was conducted after ten years of operation the author affirmed that geosequestration of co2 was the most definite form of permanent geological storage of co2 available geological information shows absence of major tectonic events after the deposition of the utsira formation saline reservoir this implies that the geological environment is tectonically stable and a site suitable for carbon dioxide storage the solubility trapping is the most permanent and secure form of geological storage 56 in march 2009 statoilhydro issued a study showing the slow spread of co2 in the formation after more than 10 years operation 57 phase i of the weyburn-midale carbon dioxide project in weyburn saskatchewan canada has determined that the likelihood of stored co2 release is less than one percent in 5,000 years 58 a january 2011 report however claimed evidence of leakage in land above that project 59 this report was strongly refuted by the ieaghg weyburn-midale co2 monitoring and storage project which issued an eight-page analysis of the study claiming that it showed no evidence of leakage from the reservoir 60 the liability of potential leaks is one of the largest barriers to large-scale ccs to assess and reduce such liability the leakage of stored gasses particularly carbon dioxide into the atmosphere may be detected via atmospheric gas monitoring and can be quantified directly via the eddy covariance flux measurements 61 62 63 monitoring geological sequestration sitesedit in order to detect carbon dioxide leaks and the effectiveness of geological sequestration sites different monitoring techniques can be employed to verify that the sequestered carbon stays trapped below the surface in the intended reservoir leakage due to injection at improper locations or conditions could result in carbon dioxide being released back into the atmosphere it is important to be able to detect leaks with enough warning to put a stop to it and to be able to quantify the amount of carbon that has leaked for purposes such as cap and trade policies evaluation of environmental impact of leaked carbon as well as accounting for the total loss and cost of the process to quantify the amount of carbon dioxide released should a leak occur or to closely watch stored co2 there are several monitoring methods that can be done at both the surface and subsurface levels 64 subsurface monitoringedit in subsurface monitoring there are direct and indirect methods to determine the amount of co2 in the reservoir a direct method would be drilling deep enough to collect a fluid sample this drilling can be difficult and expensive due to the physical properties of the rock it also only provides data at a specific location indirect methods would be to send sound or electromagnetic waves down to the reservoir where it is then reflected back up to be interpreted this approach is also expensive but it provides data over a much larger region it does however lack precision both direct and indirect monitoring can be done intermittently or continuously 64 seismic monitoringedit seismic monitoring is a type of indirect subsurface monitoring it is done by creating vibrational waves either at the surface using a vibroseis truck or inside a well using spinning eccentric mass these vibrational waves then propagate through the geological layers and reflect back creating patterns that are read and interpreted by seismometers 65 it can identify migration pathways of the co2 plume 66 two examples of monitoring geological sequestration sites using seismic monitoring are the sleipner sequestration project and the frio co2 injection test although this method can confirm the presence of co2 in a given region it cannot determine the specifics of the environment or concentration of co2 surface monitoringedit eddy covariance is a surface monitoring technique that measures the flux of co2 from the grounds surface it involves measuring co2 concentrations as well as vertical wind velocities using an anemometer 67 this provides a measure of the total vertical flux of co2 eddy covariance towers could potentially detect leaks however the natural carbon cycle such as photosynthesis and the respiration of plants would have to be accounted for and a baseline co2 cycle would have to be developed for the location of monitoring an example of eddy covariance techniques used to monitor carbon sequestration sites is the shallow release test another similar approach is utilizing accumulation chambers these chambers are sealed to the ground with an inlet and outlet flow stream connected to a gas analyzer 64 this also measures the vertical flux of co2 the disadvantage of accumulation chambers is its inability to monitor a large region which is necessary in detecting co2 leaks over the entire sequestration site insar monitoringedit insar monitoring is another type of surface monitoring it involves a satellite sending signals down to the earths surface where it is reflected back to the satellites receiver from this the satellite is able to measure the distance to that point 68 in ccs the injection of co2 in deep sublayers of geological sites creates high pressures these high pressured fluid filled layers affect those above and below it resulting in a change of the surface landscape in areas of stored co2 the grounds surface often rises due to the high pressures originating in the deep subsurface layers these changes in elevation of the earths surface corresponds to a change in the distance from the insar satellite which is then detectable and measurable 68 carbon dioxide recycling - carbon capture and utilization ccuedit recycling co2 may offer a response to the global challenge of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major stationary industrial emitters in the near to medium termcitation needed but is usually considered a different technological category from ccs 69 technologies under development such as bio ccs algal synthesis 70 utilises pre-smokestack co2 such as from a coal-fired power station as a useful feedstock input to the production of oil-rich algae in solar membranes to produce oil for plastics and transport fuel including aviation fuel and nutritious stock-feed for farm animal production 70 the co2 and other captured greenhouse gases are injected into the membranes containing waste water and select strains of algae causing together with sunlight or uv light an oil rich biomass that doubles in mass every 24 hourscitation needed the bio ccs algal synthesis process is based on earth science photosynthesis the technology is entirely retrofittable and collocated with the emitter and the capital outlays may offer a return upon investment due to the high value commodities produced oil for plastics fuel and feed bio ccs algal synthesis test facilities were being trialed at australias three largest coal-fired power stations tarong queensland eraring nsw loy yang victoria using piped pre-emission smokestack co2 and other greenhouse gases as feedstock to grow oil-rich algal biomass in enclosed membranes for the production of plastics transport fuel and nutritious animal feed another potentially useful way of dealing with industrial sources of co2 is to convert it into hydrocarbons where it can be stored or reused as fuel or to make plastics there are a number of projects investigating this possibility 71 carbon dioxide scrubbing variants exist based on potassium carbonate which can be used to create liquid fuels though this process requires a great deal of energy input 72 although the creation of fuel from atmospheric co2 is not a climate engineering technique nor does it actually function as greenhouse gas remediation because carbon dioxide will be re-released when the fuel is burned it nevertheless is potentially useful in the creation of a low carbon economy other uses are the production of stable carbonates from silicates eg olivine produces magnesium carbonate this process is still in the rd phase 73 single step methods methanoledit a proven process to produce a hydrocarbon is to make methanol methanol is easily synthesized from co2 and h2 based on this fact the idea of a methanol economy was born single step methods hydrocarbonsedit at the department of industrial chemistry and engineering of materials at the university of messina italy there is a project to develop a system which works like a fuel-cell in reverse whereby a catalyst is used that enables sunlight to split water into hydrogen ions and oxygen gas the ions cross a membrane where they react with the co2 to create hydrocarbons 74 two step methodsedit if co2 is heated to 2400c it splits into carbon monoxide co and oxygen the fischer-tropsch process can then be used to convert the co into hydrocarbons the required temperature can be achieved by using a chamber containing a mirror to focus sunlight on the gas rival teams are developing such chambers at solarec and at sandia national laboratories both based in new mexico 75 according to sandia these chambers could provide enough fuel to power 100 of domestic vehicles using 5800km2 unlike biofuels this would not take fertile land away from crops but would be land that is not being used for anything else james may the british tv presenter visited a demonstration plant in a programme in his big ideas series example ccs projectsedit industrial-scale projectsedit as of

extracted from a natural gas reservoir via a well compressed and piped 2.25km to a new well there the gas has been injected into a depleted natural gas reservoir approximately two kilometers below the surface 143 144 the project has moved to a second stage and is investigating carbon dioxide trapping in a saline aquifer 1500 meters below the surface the otway project is a research and demonstration project focused on comprehensive monitoring and verification 145 this plant does not propose to capture co2 from coal-fired power generation though two co2crc demonstration projects at a victorian power station and research gasifier are demonstrating solvent membrane and adsorbent capture technologies from coal combustion 146 currently only small-scale projects are storing co2 stripped from the products of combustion of coal burnt for electricity generation at coal-fired power stations 147 work currently being carried out by the greenmag group and the university of newcastle and funded by the new south wales and australian governments and industry intends to have a working mineral carbonation pilot plant in operation by 2013 40 view the full list of zero emission projects for fossil fuel power plant in europe 148 limitations of ccs for power stationsedit critics say large-scale ccs deployment is unproven and decades away from being commercialized they say that it is risky and expensive and that a better option is renewable energy some environmental groups point out that ccs technology leaves behind dangerous waste material that has to be stored just like nuclear power stations 149 another limitation of ccs is its energy penalty the technology is expected to use between 10 and 40 percent of the energy produced by a power station 150 wide-scale adoption of ccs may erase efficiency gains in coal power plants of the last 50 years and increase resource consumption by one third even taking the fuel penalty into account however overall levels of co2 abatement would remain high at approximately 80–90 compared to a plant without ccs 151 it is possible for ccs when combined with biomass to result in net negative emissions 152 though all of the currently as of feb 2011 operational beccs bio-energy with carbon capture and storage plants operate on point emissions other than power stations such as biofuel refineries 153 the use of ccs can reduce co2 emissions from the stacks of coal power plants by 85–90 or more but it has no effect on co2 emissions due to the mining and transport of coal it will actually increase such emissions and of air pollutants per unit of net delivered power and will increase all ecological land-use air-pollution and water-pollution impacts from coal mining transport and processing because the ccs system requires 25 more energy thus 25 more coal combustion than does a system without ccs 154 another concern regards the permanence of storage schemes opponents to ccs claim that safe and permanent storage of co2 cannot be guaranteed and that even very low leakage rates could undermine any climate mitigation effect 150 in 1986 a large leakage of naturally sequestered co2 rose from lake nyos in cameroon and asphyxiated 1,700 people while the carbon had been sequestered naturally some point to the event as evidence for the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestering carbon artificially 55 149 on one hand greenpeace claims that ccs could lead to a doubling of coal plant costs 150 it is also claimed by opponents to ccs that money spent on ccs will divert investments away from other solutions to climate change on the other hand ccs is pointed out as economically attractive in comparison to other forms of low carbon electricity generation and seen by the ipcc and others as a critical component for meeting mitigation targets such as 450 ppm and 350 ppm 155 156 157 costedit although the processes involved in ccs have been demonstrated in other industrial applications no commercial scale projects which integrate these processes exist the costs therefore are somewhat uncertain some recent credible estimates indicate that the cost of capturing and storing carbon dioxide is us$60 per ton 158 corresponding to an increase in electricity prices of about us 6c per kwh based on typical coal-fired power plant emissions of 0.97kg  2.13lb co2 per kwh this would double the typical us industrial electricity price now at around 6c per kwh and increase the typical retail residential electricity price by about 50 assuming 100 of power is from coal which may not necessarily be the case as this varies from state to state similar approximate price increases would likely be expected in coal dependent countries such as australia because the capture technology and chemistry as well as the transport and injection costs from such power plants would not in an overall sense vary significantly from country to countrycitation needed the reasons that ccs is expected to cause such power price increases are several firstly the increased energy requirements of capturing and compressing co2 significantly raises the operating costs of ccs-equipped power plants in addition there are added investment and capital costs the process would increase the fuel requirement of a plant with ccs by about 25 for a coal-fired plant and about 15 for a gas-fired plant 4 the cost of this extra fuel as well as storage and other system costs are estimated to increase the costs of energy from a power plant with ccs by 30–60 depending on the specific circumstances pre-commercial ccs demonstration projects are likely to be more expensive than mature ccs technology the total additional costs of an early large-scale ccs demonstration project are estimated to be €0.5-1.1 billion per project over the project lifetime other applications are possible in the belief that use of sequestered carbon could be harnessed to offset the cost of capture and storage walker architects published the first co2 gas caes application proposing the use of sequestered co2 for energy storage on october 24 2008 to date the feasibility of such potential offsets to the cost have not been examined 159 the cost of ccs depends on the cost of capture and storage which varies according to the method used geological storage in saline formations or depleted oil or gas fields typically cost us$0.50–8.00 per tonne of co2 injected plus an additional us$0.10–0.30 for monitoring costs when storage is combined with enhanced oil recovery to extract extra oil from an oil field however the storage could yield net benefits of us$10–16 per tonne of co2 injected based on 2003 oil prices this would likely negate some of the effect of the carbon capture when the oil was burnt as fuel even taking this into account as the table above shows the benefits do not outweigh the extra costs of capturecitation needed cost of electricity generated by different sources including those incorporating ccs technologies can be found in cost of electricity by source if co2 capture was part of a fuel cycle then the co2 would have value rather than be a cost the proposed solar fuel or methane cycle proposed by the fraunhofer societycitation needed amongst others is an example this solar fuel 160 cycle uses the excess electrical renewable energy to create hydrogen via electrolysis of water 161 162 the hydrogen is then combined with co2 to create synthetic natural gas sng and stored in the gas network see the latest cost report on the cost of co2 capture produced by the zero emissions platform governments around the world have provided a range of different types of funding support to ccs demonstration projects including tax credits allocations and grants the funding is associated with both a desire to accelerate innovation activities for ccs as a low-carbon technology and the need for economic stimulus activities as of 2011 approximately us$23.5bn has been made available to support large-scale ccs demonstration projects around the world 163 carbon capture and storage and the kyoto protocoledit one way to finance future ccs projects could be through the clean development mechanism of the kyoto protocol at cop16 in 2010 the subsidiary body for scientific and technological advice at its thirty-third session issued a draft document recommending the inclusion of carbon dioxide capture and storage in geological formations in clean development mechanism project activities 164 at cop17 in durban a final agreement was reached enabling ccs projects to receive support through the clean development mechanism 165 environmental effectsedit the theoretical merit of ccs systems is the reduction of co2 emissions by up to 90 depending on plant type generally environmental effects from use of ccs arise during power production co2 capture transport and storage issues relating to storage are discussed in those sections additional energy is required for co2 capture and this means that substantially more fuel has to be used to produce the same amount of power depending on the plant type for new super-critical pulverized coal pc plants using current technology the extra energy requirements range from 24 to 40 while for natural gas combined cycle ngcc plants the range is 11–22 and for coal-based gasification combined cycle igcc systems it is 14–25 ipcc 2005 166 obviously fuel use and environmental problems arising from mining and extraction of coal or gas increase accordingly plants equipped with flue-gas desulfurization fgd systems for sulfur dioxide control require proportionally greater amounts of limestone and systems equipped with selective catalytic reduction systems for nitrogen oxides produced during combustion require proportionally greater amounts of ammonia ipcc has provided estimates of air emissions from various ccs plant designs see table below while co2 is drastically reduced though never completely captured emissions of air pollutants increase significantly generally due to the energy penalty of capture hence the use of ccs entails a reduction in air quality type and amount of air pollutants still depends on technology co2 is captured with alkaline solvents catching the acidic co2 at low temperatures in the absorber and releasing co2 at higher temperatures in a desorber chilled ammonia ccs plants have inevitable ammonia emissions to air functionalized ammonia emit less ammonia but amines may form secondary amines and these will emit volatile nitrosamines 167 by a side reaction with nitrogendioxide which is present in any flue gas even after denox nevertheless there are advanced amines in testing with little to no vapor pressure to avoid these amine- and consecutive nitrosamine emissions nevertheless all the capture plants amines have in common that practically 100 of remaining sulfur dioxide from the plant is washed out of the flue gas the same applies to dustash see alsoedit energy portal sustainable
