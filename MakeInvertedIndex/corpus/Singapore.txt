best practices to ensure the nations attractiveness as an investment destination and business hub 32 42 43 the legal system of singapore is based on english common law but with substantial local

most technologically advanced in southeast asia 67 it comprises the singapore army republic of singapore navy and republic of singapore air force it is seen as the guarantor of the countrys independence 68 the nations philosophy of defence is one of diplomacy and deterrence 69 this principle translates into the culture involving all citizens in the countrys defence 70 the government spends 4.9 of the countrys gdp on the military and one out of every four dollars of government spending is spent on defence 71 after its independence singapore had two infantry regiments commanded by british officers this force was considered too small to provide effective security for the new country so development of its military forces became a priority 72 britain pulled its military out of singapore in october 1971 leaving behind only a small british australian and new zealand force as a token military presence the last british soldier left singapore in march 1976 new zealand troops were the last to leave in 1989 73 a great deal of initial support came from israel 72 a country that is not recognised by the neighbouring muslim-majority nations of malaysia indonesia or brunei 74 75 76 the main fear after independence was an invasion by malaysia israeli defense force idf commanders were tasked with creating the singapore armed forces saf from scratch and israeli instructors were brought in to train singaporean soldiers military courses were conducted according to the idfs format and singapore adopted a system of conscription and reserve service based on the israeli model 72 singapore still maintains strong security ties with israel and is one of the biggest buyers of israeli arms and weapons systems 77 the matador is one example of recent singaporeanisraeli collaboration 78 the saf is being developed to respond to a wide range of issues in both conventional and unconventional warfare the defence science and technology agency is responsible for procuring resources for the military 69 the geographic restrictions of singapore mean that the saf must plan to fully repulse an attack as they can not fall back and re-group the small size of the population has also affected the way the saf has been designed with a small active force but a large number of reserves 70 singapore has conscription for all able-bodied males at age 18 except those with a criminal record or who can prove that their loss would bring hardship to their families males who have yet to complete pre-university education or are awarded the public service commission scholarship can opt to defer their draft though not required to perform military service the number of women in the saf has been increasing since 1989 they have been allowed to fill military vocations formerly reserved for men before induction into a specific branch of the armed forces recruits undergo at least 9 weeks of basic military training 79 because of the scarcity of open land on the main island training involving activities such as live firing and amphibious warfare is often carried out on smaller islands typically barred to civilian access this also avoids risk to the main island and the city however large-scale drills are considered too dangerous to be performed in the area and since 1975 have been performed in taiwan 79 training is also held in about a dozen other countries in general military exercises are held with foreign forces once or twice per week 70 due to airspace and land constraints the republic of singapore air force rsaf maintains a number of overseas bases in australia the united states and france the rsafs 130 squadron is based in raaf base pearce western australia 80 and its 126 squadron is based in the oakey army aviation centre queensland 81 the rsaf

texas and luke air force base among others 84 85 the saf has sent forces to assist in operations outside the country in areas such as iraq 86 and afghanistan 87 in both military and civilian roles in the region it has helped stabilise east timor and has provided aid to aceh in indonesia following the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami in 2014 the rsn deployed two ships the rss resolute and the tenacious to the gulf of aden to aid in counter piracy efforts as part of task force 151 the saf also helped in relief efforts during hurricane katrina and typhoon haiyan 88 singapore is part of

89 there are two man-made connections to johor malaysia the johorsingapore causeway in the north and the tuas second link in the west jurong island pulau tekong pulau ubin and sentosa are the largest of singapores smaller islands the highest natural point is bukit timah hill at 163.63m  537ft 90 ongoing land reclamation projects have increased singapores land area from 581.5km2  224.5sqmi in the

land reclamation to form larger more functional islands as has been done with jurong island 93 nearly 10 of singapores land has been set aside for parks and nature reserves the network of nature reserves parks park connectors nature ways tree-lined roads and other natural areas have enhanced the sense of green space in the city 94 this is a result of five decades of greening efforts which began in 1963 when prime minister lee kuan yew launched singapores first tree-planting campaign by planting a mempat tree cratoxylum formosum the aim was to soften the harshness of urbanisation and improve the quality of life 95 this initiative continued into the 1970s and 1980s under the parks and recreation department prd renamed the national parks board abbreviation nparks in july 1996 due to these efforts singapore was ranked fourth in the 2014 environmental performance index which measures the effectiveness of state policies for environmental sustainability 96 climate singapore has a

often haze caused by bush fires in neighbouring indonesia usually from the island of sumatra 99 although singapore does not observe daylight saving time dst it follows the gmt+8 time zone one hour ahead of the typical zone for its geographical location 100  biodiversity singapores environment has changed drastically due to rapid urbanisation and immense population density in 1819 when a british trading post was first established on the island singapore was still nearly entirely covered in rainforests during that time it still contained flora shared with the malay peninsula but the biodiversity of the fauna was even then relatively low following the establishment of the trading post rapid deforestation began due to crop cultivation deforestation of singapore was largely completed by the 20th century by some estimates there has been a loss of 95 of the natural habitats of singapore over the course of the past 183 years 103 in modern times over half of the naturally occurring fauna and flora in singapore is present only in nature reserves such as the bukit timah nature reserve and the sungei buloh wetland reserve which comprise only 0.25 of singapores land area 103 to combat these problems the singaporean government has made the singapore green plan in 1992 and the new singapore green plan in 2012 to continue it the plan aims to keep tabs on the unstable populations of fauna and flora to place new nature parks and to connect existing parks in addition there are plans to set up a national biodiversity reference centre now known as the national biodiversity centre 104 economy pre-independence economy before independence in 1965 singapore was the capital of the british straits settlements a crown colony because it held the main british naval base in east asia and the largest dry dock of its time singapore was commonly described in the press as the gibraltar of the east 105 106 the opening of the suez canal in 1869 led to a major increase
