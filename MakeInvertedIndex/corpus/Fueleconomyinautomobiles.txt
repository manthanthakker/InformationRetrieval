fuel economy in automobiles the fuel economy of an automobile is the fuel efficiency relationship between the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle consumption can be expressed in terms of volume of fuel to travel a distance or the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel consumed since fuel consumption of vehicles is a significant factor in air pollution and since importation of motor fuel can be a large part of a nations foreign trade many countries impose requirements for fuel economy different measurement cycles are used to approximate the actual performance of the vehicle the energy in fuel is required to overcome various losses wind resistance tire drag and others in propelling the vehicle and in providing power to vehicle systems such as ignition or air conditioning various measures can be taken to reduce losses at each of the conversions between chemical energy in fuel and kinetic energy of the vehicle driver behavior can affect fuel economy maneuvers such as sudden acceleration and heavy braking waste energy electric cars do not directly burn fuel and so do not have fuel economy per se but equivalence measures such as miles per

fuel economy statisticsedit while the thermal efficiency mechanical output to chemical energy in fuel of petroleum engines has increased since the beginning of the automotive era to around 20-30 6 this is not the only factor in fuel economy the design of automobile as a whole and usage pattern affects the fuel economy published fuel economy is subject to variation between jurisdiction due to variations in testing protocols the average fuel economy for new passenger car in the united states rose from 17 mpg in 1978 to more than 22 mpg in 1982 7 the average fuel economy in 2008 for new cars light trucks and suvs in the united states was 26.4 mpgus  8.9 l/100km 8 2008 model year cars classified as midsize by the us epa ranged from 11 to 46 mpgus 21 to 5 l/100km 9 however due to environmental concerns caused by co2 emissions new eu regulations are being introduced to reduce the average emissions of cars sold beginning in 2012 to 130 gkm of co2 equivalent to 4.5 l/100km  52 mpgus 63 mpgimp for a diesel-fueled car and 5.0 l/100km  47 mpgus 56 mpgimp for a gasoline petrol-fueled car 10 the average consumption across the fleet is not immediately affected by the new vehicle fuel economy for example australias car fleet average in 2004 was 11.5 l/100km  20.5 mpgus 11 compared with the average new car consumption in the same year of 9.3 l/100km  25.3 mpgus 12 speed and fuel economy studiesedit fuel economy at steady speeds with selected vehicles was studied in 2010 the most recent study 13 indicates greater fuel efficiency at higher speeds than earlier studies for example some vehicles achieve better fuel economy at 100kmh  62mph rather than at 70kmh  43mph 13 although not their best economy such as the 1994 oldsmobile cutlass which has its best economy at 90 kilometres per hour  56mph  8.1l/100km  29mpg-us and gets 2 mpg better economy at 105kmh  65mph than at 72kmh  45mph  9.4l/100km  25mpg-us vs 22mpg-us  11l/100km the proportion of driving on high speed roadways varies from 4 in ireland to 41 in the netherlands when the us national maximum speed laws 55mph  89kmh speed limit was mandated there were complaints that fuel economy could decrease instead of increase the 1997 toyota celica got 1 mpg better fuel-efficiency at 105kmh  65mph than it did at 65kmh  40mph  5.41l/100km  43.5mpg-us vs 5.53l/100km  42.5mpg-us although almost 5 mpg better at 60mph  97kmh than at 65mph  105kmh  48.4mpg-us  4.86l/100km vs 43.5mpg-us  5.41l/100km and its best economy  52.6mpg-us  4.47l/100km at only 25mph  40kmh other vehicles tested had from 1.4 to 20.2 better fuel-efficiency at 90kmh  56mph vs 105kmh  65mph their best economy was reached at speeds of 40 to 90kmh  25 to 56mph see graph 13 officials hoped that the 55mph  90kmh limit combined with a ban on ornamental lighting no gasoline sales on sunday and a 15 cut in gasoline production would reduce total gas consumption by 200,000 barrels a day representing a 2.2 drop from annualized 1973 gasoline consumption levels 14a this was partly based on a belief that cars achieve maximum efficiency between 65 and 80kmh  40 and 50mph and that trucks and buses were most efficient at 55mph  89kmh 16 in 1998 the us transportation research board footnoted an estimate that the 1974 national maximum speed limit nmsl reduced fuel consumption by 0.2 to 1.0 percent 17 rural interstates the roads most visibly affected by the nmsl accounted for 9.5 of the us vehicle-miles-traveled in 1973 18 but such free-flowing roads typically provide more fuel-efficient travel than conventional roads

multiplied by the distance through which the vehicle travels represents the work that the vehicles engine must perform the study of fuel economy the amount of energy consumed per unit of distance traveled requires a detailed analysis of the forces that oppose a vehicles motion in terms of physics force  rate at which the amount of work generated energy delivered varies with the distance traveled or note the amount of work generated by the vehicles power source energy delivered by the engine would be exactly proportional to the amount of fuel energy consumed by the engine if the engines efficiency is the same regardless of power output but this is not necessarily the case due to the operating characteristics of the internal combustion engine for a vehicle whose source of power is a heat engine an engine that uses heat to perform useful work the amount of fuel energy that a vehicle consumes per unit of distance level road depends upon ideally a car traveling at a constant velocity on level ground in a vacuum with frictionless wheels could travel at any speed without consuming any energy beyond what is needed to get the car up to speed less ideally any vehicle must expend energy on overcoming road load forces which consist of aerodynamic drag tire rolling resistance and inertial energy that is lost when the vehicle is decelerated by friction brakes with ideal regenerative braking the inertial energy could be completely recovered but there are few options for reducing aerodynamic drag or rolling resistance other than optimizing the vehicles shape and the tire design road load energy or the energy demanded at the wheels can be calculated by evaluating the vehicle equation of motion over a specific driving cycle 24 the vehicle powertrain must then provide this minimum energy in order to move the vehicle and will lose a large amount of additional energy in the process of converting fuel energy into work and transmitting it to the wheels overall the sources of energy loss in moving a vehicle may be summarized as follows engine efficiency  20-30 6 which varies with engine type the mass of the automobile and its load and engine speed usually measured in rpm aerodynamic drag force which increases roughly by the square of the cars speed but note that drag power goes by the cube of the cars speed rolling friction braking although regenerative braking captures some of the energy that would otherwise be lost losses in the transmission manual transmissions can be up to 94 efficient whereas older automatic transmissions may be as low as 70 efficient 25 automatically controlled shifting of gearboxes that have the same internals as manual boxes will give the same efficiency as a pure manual gearbox plus the bonus of added intelligence selecting optimal shifting points air conditioning the power required for the engine to turn the compressor decreases the fuel-efficiency though only when in use this may be offset by the reduced drag of the vehicle compared with driving with the windows down the efficiency of ac systems gradually deteriorates due to dirty filters etc regular maintenance prevents this the extra mass of the air conditioning system will cause a slight increase in fuel consumption power steering older hydraulic power steering systems are powered by a hydraulic pump constantly engaged to the engine power assistance required for steering is inversely proportional to the vehicle speed so the constant load on the engine from a hydraulic pump reduces fuel efficiency more modern designs improve fuel efficiency by only activating the power assistance when needed this is done by using either direct electrical power steering assistance or an electrically powered hydraulic pump cooling older cooling systems used a constantly engaged mechanical fan to draw air through the radiator at a rate directly related to the engine speed this constant load reduces efficiency more modern systems use electrical fans to draw additional air through the radiator when extra cooling is required electrical systems headlights battery charging active suspension circulating fans defrosters media systems speakers and other electronics can also significantly increase fuel consumption as the energy to power these devices causes increased load on the alternator since alternators are commonly only 40–60 efficient the added load from electronics on the engine can be as high as 3 horsepower  2.2kw at any speed including idle in the ftp 75 cycle test a 200 watt load on the alternator reduces fuel efficiency by 1.7mpg 26 headlights for example consume 110 watts on low and up to 240 watts on high these electrical loads can cause much of the discrepancy between real world and epa tests which only include the electrical loads required to run the engine and basic climate control standby the energy needed to keep the engine running while it is not providing power to the wheels ie when stopped coasting or braking fuel-efficiency decreases from electrical loads are most pronounced at lower speeds because most electrical loads are constant while engine load increases with speed so at a lower speed a higher proportion of engine horsepower is used by electrical loads hybrid cars see the greatest effect on fuel-efficiency from electrical loads because of this proportional effect fuel

consequent re-acceleration time-optimized piston path to capture energy from hot gases in the cylinders when they are at their highest temperatures 29 sterling hybrid battery vehicle many aftermarket consumer products exist that are purported to increase fuel economy many of these claims have been discredited in the united states the environmental protection agency maintains a list of devices that have been tested by independent laboratories and makes the test results available to the public 30 fuel economy data reliabilityedit the mandatory publication of the fuel consumption by the manufacturer led some to use dubious practices to reach better values in the past if the test is on a test stand the vehicle may detect open doors and adapt the engine control also when driven according to the test regime the parameters may adapt automatically test laboratories use a golden car that is tested in each one to check that each lab produces the same set of measurements for a given drive cycle 31 tire pressures and lubricants have to be as recommended by the manufacturer higher tire pressures are required on a particular dynamometer type but this is to compensate for the different rolling resistance of the dynamometer not to produce an unrealistic load on the vehicle normally the quoted figures a manufacturer publishes have to be proved by the relevant authority witnessing vehicleengine tests some jurisdictions independently test emissions of vehicles in service and as a final measure can force a recall of all of a particular type of vehicle if the customer vehicles do not fulfill manufacturers claims within reasonable limits the expense and bad publicity from such a recall encourages manufacturers to publish realistic figures the us federal government retests 10–15 of models 32 to make sure that the manufacturers tests are accurate real world fuel consumption can vary greatly as they can be affected by many factors that have little to do with the vehicle driving conditions  weather traffic temperature driving style  hard braking jack rabbit starts and speeding road conditions  paved vs gravel smooth vs potholes and things like carrying excess weight roof racks and fuel quality can all combine to dramatically increase fuel consumption expecting to consistently perform in the face of so many variables is impossible as is the expectation for one set of numbers to encompass every driver and their personal circumstances the ratings are meant to provide a comparison and are not a promise of actual performance concerns over epa estimatesedit for many years critics had claimed that epa estimated fuel economy figures had been misleading the primary arguments of the epa detractors were focused on the lack of real world testing and the very limited scale ie city or highway partly as a response to these criticisms the epa changed their fuel economy rating system in 2008 in an attempt to more adequately address these concerns instead of testing simply in two presumed modes the testing now covers 33 faster speeds and acceleration air conditioner use colder outside temperatures while the new epa standards may represent an improvement real world user data may still be the best way to gather and collect accurate fuel economy information as such the epa has also set up a httpwwwfueleconomygovmpgmpgdoactionbrowselist website where drivers can enter and track their own real-world fuel economy numbers there are also a number of websites that attempt to track and report individual user fuel economy data through real-life driving sites or publications such as consumer reports edmundscom consumer guide and truedeltacom offer this service and claim more accurate numbers than those listed by the epa fuel economy maximizing behaviorsedit governments various environmentalist organizations and companies like toyota and shell oil company have historically urged drivers to maintain adequate air pressure in tires and careful accelerationdeceleration habits keeping track of fuel efficiency stimulates fuel economy-maximizing behavior 34 a five-year partnership between michelin and anglian water shows that 60,000 litres fuel can be saved on tyre pressure the anglian water fleet of 4,000 vans and cars are now lasting their full lifetimethis shows the impact that tyre pressures have on the fuel efficiency 35 fuel economy as part of quality management regimesedit environmental management systems emas as well as good fleet management includes record keeping of the fleet fuel consumption quality management uses those figures to steer the measures acting on the fleets this is a way to check whether procurement driving and maintenance in total have contributed to changes in the fleets overall consumption fuel economy standards and testing proceduresedit  highway  combined australiaedit from october 2008 all new cars had to be sold with a sticker on the windscreen showing the fuel consumption and the co2 emissions 37 fuel consumption figures are expressed as urban extra urban and combined measured according to ece regulations 83 and 101 - which are the based on the european driving cycle previously only the combined number was given australia also uses a star rating system from one to five stars that combines greenhouse gases with pollution rating each from 0 to 10 with ten being best to get 5 stars a combined score of 16 or better is needed so a car with a 10 for economy greenhouse and a 6 for emission or 6 for economy and 10 for emission or anything in between would get the highest 5 star rating 38 the lowest rated car is the ssangyong korrando with automatic transmission with one star while the highest rated was the toyota prius hybrid the fiat 500 fiat punto and fiat ritmo as well as the citroen c3 also received 5 stars 39 the greenhouse rating depends on the fuel economy and the type of fuel used a greenhouse rating of 10 requires 60 or less grams of co2 per km while a rating of zero is more than 440 gkm co2 the highest greenhouse rating of any 2009 car listed is the toyota prius with 106gkm co2 and 4.4l/100km  64mpg-imp 53mpg-us several other cars also received the same rating of 8.5 for greenhouse the lowest rated was the ferrari 575 at 499gkm co2 and 21.8l/100km  13.0mpg-imp 10.8mpg-us the bentley also received a zero rating at 465gkm co2 the best fuel economy of any year is the 2004–2005 honda insight at 3.4l/100km  83mpg-imp 69mpg-us canadaedit vehicle manufacturers follow a controlled laboratory testing procedure to generate the fuel consumption data that they submit to the government of canada this controlled method of fuel consumption testing including the use of standardized fuels test cycles and calculations is used instead of on-road driving to ensure that all vehicles are tested under identical conditions and that the results are consistent and repeatable selected test vehicles are run in for about 6,000km before testing the vehicle is then mounted on a chassis dynamometer programmed to take into account the aerodynamic efficiency weight and rolling resistance of the vehicle a trained driver runs the vehicle through standardized driving cycles that simulate trips in the city and on the highway fuel consumption ratings are derived from the emissions generated during the driving cycles 40 the 5 cycle test 1 the city test simulates urban driving in stop-and-go traffic with an average speed of 34kmh and a top speed of 90kmh the test runs for approximately 31 minutes and includes 23 stops the test begins from a cold engine start which is similar to starting a vehicle after it has been parked overnight during the summer the final phase of the test repeats the first eight minutes of the cycle but with a hot engine start this simulates restarting a vehicle after it has been warmed up driven and then stopped for a short time over five minutes of test time are spent idling to represent waiting at traffic lights the ambient temperature of the test cell starts at 20c and ends at 30c 2 the highway test simulates a mixture of open highway and rural road driving with an average speed of 78kmh and a top speed of 97kmh the test runs for approximately 13 minutes and does not include any stops the test begins from a hot engine start the ambient temperature of the test cell starts at 20c and ends at 30c 3 in the cold temperature operation test the same driving cycle is used as in the standard city test except that the ambient temperature of the test cell is set to -7c 4 in the air conditioning test the ambient temperature of the test cell is raised to 35c the vehicles climate control system is then used to lower the internal cabin temperature starting with a warm engine the test averages 35kmh and reaches a maximum speed of 88kmh five stops are included with idling occurring 19 of the time 5 the high speedquick acceleration test averages 78kmh and reaches a top speed of 129kmh four stops are included and brisk acceleration maximizes at a rate of 13.6kmh per second the engine begins warm and air conditioning is not used the ambient temperature of the test cell is constantly 25c tests 1 3 4  5 are averaged to create the city driving fuel consumption rate tests 2 4  5 are averaged to create the highway driving fuel consumption rate 40 europeedit in the european union passenger vehicles are commonly tested using two drive cycles and corresponding fuel economies are reported as urban and extra-urban in litres per 100km and in the uk in miles per imperial gallon the urban economy is measured using the test cycle known as ece-15 first introduced in 1970 by ec directive 70/220ewg and finalized by eec directive 90c81/01 in 1999 it simulates a 4,052m  2.518mile urban trip at an average speed of 18.7kmh  11.6mph and at a maximum speed of 50kmh  31mph the extra-urban driving cycle or eudc lasts 400 seconds  6minutes 40 seconds at an average speed 62.6kmh  39mph and a top speed of 120kmh  74.6mph 41 eu fuel consumption numbers are often considerably lower than corresponding us epa test results for the same vehicle for example the 2011 honda cr-z with a six-speed manual transmission is rated 6.1/4.4 l/100km in europe 42 and 7.6/6.4 l/100km  31/37 mpg  in the united states 43 in the european union advertising has to show carbon dioxide co2-emission and fuel consumption data in a clear way as described in the uk statutory instrument 2004 no 1661 44 since september 2005 a colour-coded green rating sticker has been available in the uk which rates fuel economy by co2 emissions a  100 gkm b 100–120 c 121–150 d 151–165 e 166–185 f 186–225 and g 226 depending on the type of fuel used for gasoline a corresponds to about 4.1l/100km  69mpg-imp 57mpg-us and g about 9.5l/100km  30mpg-imp 25mpg-us 45 ireland has a very similar label but the ranges are slightly different with a  120 gkm b 121–140 c 141–155 d 156–170 e 171–190 f 191–225 and g 226 46 in the uk the asa advertising standards agency have claimed that fuel consumption figures are misleading often the case with european vehicles as the mpg miles per gallon figures that can be advertised are often not the same as real world driving the asa have said that car manufacturers can use cheats to prepare their vehicles for their compulsory fuel efficiency and emissions tests in a way set out to make themselves look as clean as possible this practice is common in petrol and diesel vehicle tests but hybrid and electric vehicles are not immune as manufacturers apply these techniques to fuel efficiency car expertswho also assert that the official mpg figures given by manufacturers do not represent the true mpg values from real-world driving 47 websites have been set up to show the real-world mpg figures based on crowd-sourced data from real users vs the official mpg figures 48 the major loopholes in the current eu tests allow car manufacturers a number of cheats to improve results car manufacturers can disconnect the alternator thus no energy is used to recharge the battery use special lubricants that are not used in production cars in order to reduce friction turn off all electrical gadgets ie air conradio adjust brakes or even disconnect them to reduce friction tape up cracks between body panels and windows to reduce air resistance remove wing mirrors 49 according to the results of a 2014 study by the international council on clean transportation icct the gap between official and real-world fuel-economy figures in europe has risen to about 38 in 2013 from 10 in 2001 the analysis found that for private cars the difference between on-road and official co2 values rose from around 8 in 2001 to 31 in 2013 and 45 for company cars in 2013 the report is based on data from more than half a million private and company vehicles across europe the analysis was prepared by the icct together with the netherlands organisation for applied scientific research tno and the german institut für energie- und umweltforschung heidelberg ifeu 50 japanedit the evaluation criteria used in japan reflects driving conditions commonly found as the typical japanese driver doesnt drive as fast as other regions internationally speed limits in japan 10–15 modeedit the 10–15 mode driving cycle test is the official fuel economy and emission certification test for new light duty vehicles in japan fuel economy is expressed in kml kilometers per litre and emissions are expressed in gkm the test is carried out on a dynamometer and consist of 25 tests which cover idling acceleration steady running and deceleration and simulate typical japanese urban andor expressway driving conditions the running pattern begins with a warm start lasts for 660 seconds  11 minutes and runs at speeds up to 70kmh  43.5mph 51 52 the distance of the cycle is 6.34km  3.9mi average speed of 25.6kmh  15.9mph and duration 892 seconds  14.9 minutes including the initial 15 mode segment 52 jc08edit a new more demanding test called the jc08 was established in december 2006 for japans new standard that goes into effect in 2015 but it is already being used by several car manufacturers for new cars the jc08 test is significantly longer and more rigorous than the 10–15 mode test the running pattern with jc08 stretches out to 1200 seconds  20 minutes and there are both cold and warm start measurements and top speed is 82kmh  51.0mph the economy ratings of the jc08 are lower than the 10–15 mode cycle but they are expected to be more real world 51 the toyota prius became the first car to meet japans new 2015 fuel economy standards measured under the jc08 test 53 new zealandedit starting on 7 april 2008 all cars of up to 3.5 tonnes gvw sold other than private sale need to have a fuel economy sticker applied if available that shows the rating from one half star to six stars with the most economic cars having the most stars and the more fuel hungry cars the least along with the fuel economy in l/100km and the estimated annual fuel cost for driving 14,000km at present fuel prices the stickers must also appear on vehicles to be leased for more than 4months all new cars currently rated range from 6.9l/100km  41mpg-imp 34mpg-us to 3.8l/100km  74mpg-imp 62mpg-us and received respectively from 4.5 to 5.5 stars 54 united statesedit us energy tax actedit the energy tax act of 1978 55 in the us established a gas guzzler tax on the sale of new model year vehicles whose fuel economy fails to meet certain statutory levels the tax applies only to cars not trucks and is collected by the irs its purpose is to discourage the production and purchase of fuel-inefficient vehicles the tax was phased in over ten years with rates increasing over time it applies only to manufacturers and importers of vehicles although presumably some or all of the tax is passed along to automobile consumers in the form of higher prices only new vehicles are subject to the tax so no tax is imposed on used car sales the tax is graduated to apply a higher tax rate for less-fuel-efficient vehicles to determine the tax rate manufacturers test all the vehicles at their laboratories for fuel economy the us environmental protection agency confirms a portion of those tests at an epa lab in some cases this tax may only apply to certain variants of a given model for example the 2004–2006 pontiac gto captive import version of the holden monaro did incur the tax when ordered with the four-speed automatic transmission but did not incur the tax when ordered with the six-speed manual transmission 56 epa testing procedure through 2007edit two separate fuel economy tests simulate city driving and highway driving the city driving program or urban dynamometer driving schedule or udds or ftp-72 is defined in 40 cfr 86 appi and consists of starting with a cold engine and making 23 stops over a period of 31minutes for an average speed of 20mph  32kmh and with a top speed of 56mph  90kmh the highway program or highway fuel economy driving schedule hwfet is defined in 40 cfr 600 appi and uses a warmed-up engine and makes no stops averaging 48mph  77kmh with a top speed of 60mph  97kmh over a 10-mile  16km distance the measurements are then adjusted downward by 10 city and 22 highway to more accurately reflect real-world results a weight average of city  55 and highway  45 fuel economies is used to determine the guzzler tax 57 58 the procedure has been updated to ftp-75 adding a hot start cycle which repeats the cold start cycle after a 10-minute pause because epa figures had almost always indicated better efficiency than real-world fuel-efficiency the epa has modified the method starting with 2008 updated estimates are available for vehicles back to the 1985 model year 57 59 epa

reaches a top speed of 80mph  130kmh four stops are included and brisk acceleration maximizes at a rate of 8.46mph  13.62kmh per second the engine begins warm and air conditioning is not used ambient temperature varies between 68f  20c to 86f  30c sfto sc03 is the air conditioning test which raises ambient temperatures to 95f  35c and puts the vehicles climate control system to use lasting 9.9minutes the 3.6-mile  5.8km loop averages 22mph  35kmh and maximizes at a rate of 54.8mph  88.2kmh five stops are included idling occurs 19 percent of the time and acceleration of 5.1mphsec is achieved engine temperatures begin warm lastly a cold temperature cycle uses the same parameters as the current city loop except that ambient temperature is set to 20f −7c epa tests for fuel economy do not include electrical load tests beyond climate control which may account for some of the discrepancy between epa and real world fuel-efficiency a 200w electrical load can produce a 0.4kml  0.94mpg reduction in efficiency on the ftp 75 cycle test 26 electric vehicles and hybridsedit following the efficiency claims made for vehicles such as chevrolet volt and nissan leaf the national renewable energy laboratory recommended to use epas new vehicle fuel efficiency formula that gives different values depending on fuel used 61 in november 2010 the epa introduced the first fuel economy ratings in the monroney stickers for plug-in electric vehicles for the fuel economy label of the chevy volt plug-in hybrid epa rated the car separately for all-electric mode expressed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpg-e and for gasoline-only mode expressed in conventional miles per gallon epa also estimated an overall combined cityhighway gas-electricity fuel economy rating expressed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpg-e the label also includes a table showing fuel economy and electricity consumed for five different scenarios 30 miles  48km 45 miles  72km 60 miles  97km and 75 miles  121km driven between a full charge and a never charge scenario this information was included in order to make the consumers aware of the variability of the fuel economy outcome depending on miles driven between charges also the fuel economy for a gasoline-only scenario never charge was included for electric-only mode the energy consumption estimated in kwh per 100 miles  160km is also shown 62 63 for the fuel economy label of the nissan leaf electric car epa rated the combined fuel economy in terms of miles per gallon gasoline equivalent with a separate rating for city and highway driving this fuel economy equivalence is based on the energy consumption estimated in kwh per 100 miles and also shown in the monroney label 64 in may 2011 the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa and epa issued a joint final rule establishing new requirements for a fuel economy and environment label that is mandatory for all new passenger cars and trucks starting with model year 2013 and voluntary for 2012 models the ruling includes new labels for alternative fuel and alternative propulsion vehicles available in the us market such as plug-in hybrids electric vehicles flexible-fuel vehicles hydrogen fuel cell vehicle and natural gas vehicles 65 66 the common fuel economy metric adopted to allow the comparison of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles is miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent mpge a gallon of gasoline equivalent means the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity cubic feet of compressed natural gas cng or kilograms of hydrogen that is equal to the energy in a gallon of gasoline 65 the new labels also include for the first time an estimate of how much fuel or electricity it takes to drive 100 miles  160km providing us consumers with fuel consumption per distance traveled the metric commonly used in many other countries epa explained that the objective is to avoid the traditional miles per gallon metric that can be potentially misleading when consumers compare fuel economy improvements and known as the mpg illusion 67  this illusion arises because the reciprocal ie non-linear relationship between cost equivalently volume of fuel consumed per unit distance driven and mpg value means that differences in mpg values are not directly meaningful  only ratios are in mathematical terms the reciprocal function does not commute with addition and subtraction in general a difference in reciprocal values is not equal to the reciprocal of their difference it has been claimed that many consumers are unaware of this and therefore compare mpg values by subtracting them which can give a misleading picture of relative differences in fuel economy between different pairs of vehicles  for instance an increase from 10 to 20 mpg corresponds to a 100 improvement in fuel economy whereas an increase from 50 to 60 mpg is only a 20 improvement although in both cases the difference is 10 mpg 68 the epa explained that the new gallons-per-100-miles metric provides a more accurate measure of fuel efficiency 65 69  notably it is equivalent to the normal metric measurement of fuel economy liters per 100 kilometers l/100km cafe standardsedit the corporate average fuel economy cafe regulations in the united states first enacted by congress in 1975 70 are federal regulations intended to improve the average fuel economy of cars and light trucks trucks vans and sport utility vehicles sold in the us in the wake of the 1973 arab oil embargo historically it is the sales-weighted average fuel economy of a manufacturers fleet of current model year passenger cars or light trucks manufactured for sale in the united states under truck cafe standards 2008–2011 this changes to a footprint model where larger trucks are allowed to consume more fuel the standards were limited to vehicles under a certain weight but those weight classes were expanded in 2011 state regulationsedit the states are pre-empted by federal law and are not allowed to make fuel efficiency standards however california has a special dispensation from the clean air act to make emissions standards which other states may adopt instead of the federal standards the california air resources board is implementing some legislation that limits greenhouse gas emissions a legal dispute has emerged over whether this is effectually a fuel efficiency standard unit conversionsedit 1mpg  0.425kml 235.2mpg  l/100km 1mpg  1.201mpg imp 1mpg  0.354kml 282mpg  l/100km 1mpg  0.833mpg
