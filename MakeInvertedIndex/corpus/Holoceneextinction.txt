holocene extinction the holocene extinction otherwise referred to as the sixth extinction 1 or anthropocene extinction 2 is the ongoing extinction event of species during the present holocene epoch  11,700 years before adÂ 2000 mainly due to human activity 3 4 the large number of extinctions span numerous families of plants and animals including mammals birds amphibians reptiles and arthropods although 875 extinctions occurring between 1500 and 2009 have been documented by the international union for conservation of nature and natural resources 5 with widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforest as well as other areas the vast majority are thought to be undocumented according to the species-area theory and based on upper-bound estimating the present rate of extinction may be up to 140,000 species per year 6 making it the greatest loss of biodiversity since the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event the holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as megafauna starting between 9,000 and 13,000 years ago the end of the last ice age megafauna outside of the african continent which did not evolve alongside humans proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new predation and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the earth additionally many african species have also gone extinct in the holocene the extinction of the mammoths allowed grasslands they had maintained through grazing habits to become birch forests 7 the new forest and the resulting forest fires may have induced climate change 7 such disappearances might be the result of the proliferation of modern humans 3:8 these extinctions occurring near the pleistoceneholocene boundary are sometimes referred to as the quaternary extinction event there is no general agreement on where the holocene or anthropogenic extinction begins and the quaternary extinction event which includes climate change resulting in the end of the last ice age ends or if they should be considered separate events at all 7 8 some have suggested that anthropogenic extinctions may have begun as early as when the first modern humans spread out of africa between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago which is supported by rapid megafaunal extinction following recent human colonisation in australia new zealand and madagascar 9 in a similar way that any large adaptable predator moving into a new ecosystem would in many cases it is suggested even minimal hunting pressure was enough to wipe out large fauna particularly on geographically isolated islands 10 11 only during the most recent parts of the extinction have plants also suffered large losses 12 the ecology of homo sapiens has been noted as being that of an unprecedented global superpredator 13 that regularly preys on the adults of other apex predators and has worldwide effects on food webs 14 extinctions of species have occurred on every land mass and ocean with many famous examples within africa asia europe australia north and south america and on smaller islands 15 overall the holocene extinction can be characterized by the human impact on the environment the holocene extinction continues into the 21st century with overfishing ocean acidification and the amphibian crisis being a few broader examples of an almost universal cosmopolitan decline in biodiversity it has been suggested human activity has made the period following the mid-20th century different enough from the holocene to consider it a new geological epoch known as the anthropocene 16 which will be considered for implementation into the timeline of earths history by the international commission on stratigraphy in 2016 17  contents 1 human influence on extinction 1.1

late pleistocene over 12,000 years ago there is evidence that abrupt climate change has especially played an enormous role in the extinction of larger mammals 18 however while previous mass extinctions were due to natural environmental causes research shows that wherever on earth humans have migrated other species have gone extinct and human population growth most prominently in the past two centuries is regarded as one of the underlying causes of extinction 19 in terms of how humans have contributed three major factors include the increased global concentration of greenhouse gases affecting the global climate oceanic devastation such as through overfishing and contamination and the modification and destruction of vast tracts of land and river systems around the world to meet solely human-centered ends with 13 percent of earths ice-free land surface now used as row-crop agricultural sites 26 percent used as pastures and 4 percent urban-industrial areas 20 thus replacing the original local ecosystems 21 22 other related human causes of the extinction event include deforestation hunting pollution 23 the introduction in various regions of non-native species and the widespread transmission of infectious diseases at present the rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than the base or historically typical rate of extinction in terms of the natural evolution of the planet 24 and also the current rate of extinction is therefore 10 to 100 times higher than any of the previous mass extinctions in the history of earth it is also the only known mass extinction of plantscitation needed the abundance of species extinctions considered anthropogenic or due to human activity have sometimes especially when referring to hypothesized future events been collectively called the anthropocene extinction 25 26 the anthropocene is a term introduced in 2000 it is now posited by some that a new geological epoch has begun characterised by the most abrupt and widespread extinction of species since the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event 66 million years ago 9 in the future of life  2002 eo wilson of harvard calculated that if the current rate of human disruption of the biosphere continues one-half of earths higher lifeforms will be extinct by 2100 a 1998 poll conducted by the american museum of natural history found that seventy percent of biologists believe that we are in the midst of an anthropogenic extinction 27 numerous scientific studiessuch as a 2004 report published in nature 28 and papers authored by the 10,000 scientists who contribute to the iucns annual red list of threatened specieshave since reinforced this conviction extinction of the megafauna in the late-pleistoceneedit the evidence of all previous extinctions is geological in nature and shorter geological time scale is of the order of several hundred thousand to several million years even extinctions caused by instantaneous events such as the impact of the asteroid in chicxulub which is currently the best example extend the equivalent of many human lives due to complex ecological interactions that were triggered by the eventcitation needed three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the extinction of megafauna in the late pleistocene of these only two have much scientific credibility although ross mcphee proposed that a hyper-disease may have been the cause of the extinction 29 a study by lyons et al demonstrated conclusively that a hyperdisease was unlikely to have caused the extinction 30 the two main theories to the extinction are climate change and human hunting the climate change theory has suggested that a change in climate near the end of the late pleistocene stressed the megafauna to the point of extinction 31 some scientists favor abrupt climate change as the catalyst for the extinction of the mega-fauna at the end of the pleistocene but there are many who believe increased hunting from early modern humans also played a part with others even suggesting that the two interacted 9 32 33 in the americas a controversial explanation for the shift in climate is presented under the younger dryas impact hypothesis megafauna was once found on every continent of the world and large islands such as new zealand and madagascar but is now almost exclusively found on the continent of africa with notable comparisons on australia and the islands previously mentioned experiences population crashes and trophic cascades shortly after the earliest human settlers 10 11 it has been suggested that the african megafauna survived as they evolved alongside humans 9 the timing of south american megafaunal extinction does not appear to correspond to human arrival although the possibility of whether human activity at the time may have impacted the global climate enough to cause such an extinction has been suggested 9 it has been noted in the face of such evidence homo sapiens is unique in its ecology as an unprecedented global superpredator regularly preying on large numbers of fully grown terrestrial and marine apex predators and with a great deal of influence over food webs and climatic systems worldwide 14 anthropogenic impact on climate during the holoceneedit in order to constitute the holocene as an extinction event scientists must determine exactly when anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions began to measurably alter natural atmospheric levels at a global scale and when these alterations caused changes to global climate employing chemical proxies from antarctic ice cores researchers have estimated the fluctuations of carbon dioxide c02 and methane gases ch4 in the earths atmosphere for the late pleistocene and holocene epochs 34 based on these studies general argumentation of when the peak of the anthropocene occurred pertains to the timeframe within the previous two centuries typically beginning with the industrial revolution when greenhouse gas levels were recorded by contemporary methods at its highest 35 36 however scientists that are employing a variance of archaeological and paleoecological data argue that the processes contributing to substantial human modification of the environment spanned many thousands of years ago on a global scale and thus not originating as early as the industrial revolution gaining popularity on his uncommon hypothesis palaeoclimatologist william ruddiman in 2003 stipulated that in the early holocene 11,000 years ago atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane levels has fluctuated at a different pattern than the pleistocene epoch before it 34 37 38 he argued that the patterns of the significant decline of co2 levels during the last ice age of the pleistocene inversely correlates to the holocene where there has been dramatic increases of co2 around 8000 years ago and ch4 levels 3000 years after that 38 the correlation between the downfall of co2 in the pleistocene and the uprising of it during the holocene implies that the causation of this spark of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere are due to the growth of human agriculture during the holocene such as the anthropogenic expansion of land and irrigation 34 38 recent extinctions described are well-documented but the nomenclature used varies 18 the term anthropocene is a term that is used by few scientists and some commentators may refer to the current and projected future extinctions as part of a longer holocene extinction 18 39 the holoceneanthropocene boundary is contested with some commentators asserting significant human influence on climate for much of what is normally regarded as the holocene epoch 40 other commentators place the holoceneanthropocene boundary at the industrial revolution while also saying that formal adoption of this term in the near future will largely depend on its utility particularly to earth scientists working on late holocene successions 18 agricultureedit human civilization flourished in accordance to the efficiency and intensification of prevailing subsistence systems 41 local communities that acquire more subsistence strategies increased in number to combat competitive pressures of land utilization 34 41 therefore the holocene developed competition on the basis of agriculture the growth of agriculture has then introduced newer means of climate change and pollution recent investigations about hunter-gatherer landscape burning has a major implication for the current debate about the timing of the anthropocene and the role that humans may have played in the production of greenhouse gases prior to the industrial revolution 41 studies on early hunter-gatherers raises questions about the current use of population size or density as a proxy for the amount of land clearance and anthropogenic burning that took place in preindustrial times 37 42 scientists have questioned the correlation between population size and early territorial alterations 42 ruddiman and ellis research paper in 2009 makes the case that early farmers involved in systems of agriculture used more land per capita than growers more later in the holocene who intensified their labor to produce more food per unit of area arguing that agricultural involvement in rice production implemented thousands of years ago by relatively small populations have created significant environmental impacts through large-scale means of deforestation 41 while a number of human-derived factors are recognized as potentially contributing to rising atmospheric concentrations of ch4 and co2 deforestation and territorial clearance practices associated with agricultural development may be contributing most to these concentrations globally 35 38 41 climateedit climate change in the early holocene was distinguished prior to the last glacial maximum 15,000 years ago which then started the current period of the glacial retreat where climate started to increase significantly 11,000 years ago 43 the holocene epoch contained a vast number of temperature fluctuations that can be dated from the warm period of the holocene climatic optimum in 5000 to 3000 bc that consisted of temperatures that were 1-2 degrees celsius warmer than today to the more recent emergence of the industrial revolution 37 44 45 during this period came the development of ancient civilizations of the earliest homo sapiens and the growth of agriculture due to the increase of tropical regions deepening the understanding of the anthropogenic impact in the early holocene is a vital factor for analyzing interglacial climate instability due to their involvement in producing of atmospheric carbon dioxide methodologies of the holocene climatic optimumedit to undermine the present and future human-induced climatic changes climatologists and paleontologists have correlated the increases of temperatures with the variations of solar radiation exposed to certain latitudinal earth bands during the early holocene 46 thus believing that the holocene warming was solar in origin where only certain parts of the world experienced warmer climates during seasons such as summer moreover scientists have conducted numerous oceanic sediments that can be dated back to the holocene climatic optimum and discovered drastic increases of sea-levels and their sea-level highstands 47 this evidence of drastic increases of sea levels indicates that the deterioration of ice cores is crucial to understanding how the holocene climatic optimum began and how it played as one of the major transgressions during the holocene maximum 48 as speculations of how the holocene climatic optimum began remain scientifically unclear impurities in gaseous chemistry inside these ice cores have been conducted as a valuable method of obtaining evidence of abnormal temperature fluctuations 49 the nile river showed to have a greater volume and much larger in the holocene than what it is today and the sahara to have been more fertile 50 51 this in turn led many anthropogenic hypotheses to claim that more tropical territories encouraged agricultural processes 34 however there is greater complexity as to whether such changes are heavily caused by anthropogenic effects on climate because of limited methods that can directly identify an empirical correlation prehistoric extinctions  60,000 bce-3500 bceedit although significant debate exists as to how much human predation and indirect effects contributed to prehistoric extinctions certain population crashes have been directly correlated with human arrival 8 9 australiaedit australia was once home to a large assemblage of megafauna with many parallels to those found on the african continent today australias fauna is characterised by primarily marsupial mammals and many reptiles and birds all existing as giant forms until recently humans arrived on the continent very early about 50,000 years ago 9 the extent human arrival contributed is controversial climatic drying of australia 40,000-60,000 years ago was an unlikely cause as it was less severe in speed or magnitude than previous regional climate change which failed to kill off megafauna due to the older timeframe and the soil chemistry on the continent very little subfossil preservation evidence exists relative to elsewhere 52 however continent-wide extinction of all genera weighing over 100 kilograms and six of seven genera weighing between 45 and 100 kilograms occurred around 46,400 years ago  4,000 years after human arrival 53 and the fact that megafauna survived until a later date on the island of tasmania following the establishment of a land bridge 54 suggest direct hunting or anthropogenic ecosystem disruption such as fire-stick farming as likely causes the first evidence of direct human predation leading to extinction in australia was published in 2016 55 dromornithidae an entire family of giant birds though around the size of emus they are actually more related to ducks and other waterfowl analysis of burned eggshells in genyornis newtoni which stood around 7 feet tall suggested human consumption 55 as of yet this is the most reliable

echidna quinkana a five-to-six metre-long predatory terrestrial crocodile extinctions in australia continued from original settlement until today in both plants and animals whilst many more animals and plants have declined or are endangered north and south americaedit there has been a debate as to the extent to which the disappearance of megafauna at the end of the last glacial period can be attributed to human activities by hunting or even by slaughter 56 of prey populations discoveries at monte verde in south america and at meadowcroft rock shelter in pennsylvania have caused a controversy 57 regarding the clovis culture there likely would have been human settlements prior to the clovis culture and the history of humans in the americas may extend back many thousands of years before the clovis culture 57 the amount of correlation between human arrival and megafauna extinction is still being debated for example in wrangel island in siberia the extinction of dwarf woolly mammoths approximately 2000 bce 58 did not coincide with the arrival of humans nor did megafaunal mass extinction on the south american continent although it has been suggested climate changes induced by anthropogenic effects elsewhere in the world may have contributed 9 comparisons are sometimes made between recent extinctions approximately since the industrial revolution and the pleistocene extinction near the end of the last glacial period the latter is exemplified by the extinction of large herbivores such as the woolly mammoth and the carnivores that preyed on them we know that humans of this era actively hunted the mammoth and the mastodon 59 but it is not known if this hunting was the cause of the subsequent massive ecological changes widespread extinctions and climate changes 7 8 the ecosystems encountered by the first americans had not been exposed to human interaction and may have been far less resilient to human made changes than the ecosystems encountered by industrial era humans therefore the actions of the clovis people despite seeming insignificant by todays standards could indeed have had a profound effect on the ecosystems and wild life which was entirely unused to human influence 9 the following species among many others became extinct in this period doedicurus a giant armadillo american cheetah american lion holochilus primigenus pygmy mammoth woolly mammoth and the local columbian mammoth mastodons eremotherium smilodon sabre toothed cats teratorns a group of birds that include some of the largest flying animals of all time caribbeanedit human arrival around 6,000 years ago is correlated with the extinction of many species 60 examples include many different genera of ground and arboreal sloths across all islands these sloths were generally

that numerous species became extinct as people moved across the pacific starting 30,000 years ago in the bismarck archipelago and solomon islands 61 it is currently estimated that among the bird species of the pacific some 2000 species have gone extinct since the arrival of humans representing a 20 drop in the biodiversity of birds worldwide 62 among the extinctions were sylviornis a giant

isolated land masses where megafauna continued to survive almost immediately resulted in their extinction calculations suggest this occurred even if only a small number of animals were hunted it has been suggested this contemporary evidence supports the theory that humans were capable of causing or at least contributing to the extinctions of the quaternary extinction event 9 afro-eurasian

insects mollusks and fish 30 of its organisms are endemic many of its species are endangered or have gone extinct primarily due to accidentally introduced species and livestock grazing over 40 of its bird species have gone extinct and it is the location of 75 of extinctions in the united states 63 extinction has increased in hawaii over the last 200 years and is relatively well documented with

of the islands including several species of giant tortoise on the seychelles and mascarene islands including cylindraspis and meiolania platyceps aldabrachampsus a crocodyliform found on the aldabra atoll madagascaredit within 500 years of the arrival of humans between 2,500-2,000 years ago nearly all of madagascars distinct endemic and geographically isolated megafauna became extinct 65 the largest animals of more than 150kg were extincted very shortly after the first human arrival with large and medium-sized species dying out after prolonged hunting pressure from an expanding human population moving into more remote regions of the island around 1000 years ago smaller fauna experienced initial increases due to decreased competition and then subsequent declines over the last 500 years 11 all fauna weighing over 10kg died out the primary reasons for this are human hunting and habitat loss from early aridification both of which persist and threaten madagascars remaining taxa today eight or more species of elephant birds giant flightless ratites in the genera aepyornis and mullerornis 17 species of lemur known as giant subfossil lemurs some of these lemurs typically

of ruffed lemurs recent extinctions - 1500 onwardsedit one scientist estimates the current extinction rate may be 10,000 times the background extinction rate nevertheless most scientists predict a much lower extinction rate than this outlying estimate 68 stuart pimm stated the current rate of species extinction is about 100 times the natural rate for plants 69 mass extinctions are characterized by the loss of at least 75 of species within a geologically short period of time 70 71 72 in a pair of studies published in 2015 extrapolation from observed extinction of hawaiian snails led to the conclusion that 7 of all species on earth may have been lost already 64 megafaunal extinctions continue into the 21st century modern extinctions are more directly attributable to human influences extinction rates are minimized in the popular imagination by the survival of captive populations of animals that are extinct in the wild such as the pÃ¨re davids deer hawaiian crow and by marginal survivals of highly publicized megafauna that are ecologically extinct such as the giant panda sumatran rhinoceros north american black-footed ferret however the holocene can also be characterisied by widespread extinctions among arthropods widespread local extinctions of populations of species that still exist elsewhere such as the extinction of gray whales in the atlantic and of the leatherback sea turtle in malaysia and by universal declines in range and population of various animal and plant species throughout all of the world the iucn characterises recent extinction as those that have occurred past the cut-off point of 1500 the extinct species listed below are not comprehensive but are some of the most famous examples new zealandedit new zealand is characterised by its geographic

birds but at the time of early european contact  18th century and colonisation  19th century the bird life was prolific with them the europeans brought ship rats possums cats and mustelids which decimated native bird life some of which had adapted flightlessness and ground nesting habits and others had no defensive behavior as a result of having no extant endemic mammalian predators the

that feed on them fishing has had a devastating effect on marine organism populations for several centuries even before the explosion of destructive and highly effective fishing practices like trawling 84 humans are unique among predators in that they regularly predate on other adult apex predators particularly in marine environments 14 bluefin tuna and various sharks in particular are particularly vulnerable to predation pressure from human fishing pollinator declineedit the term pollinator decline refers to the reduction in abundance of insect and other animal pollinators in many
