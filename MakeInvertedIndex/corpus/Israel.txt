etymology upon independence in 1948 the country formally adopted the name state of israel medinat yisrael after other proposed historical and religious names including eretz israel the land of israel zion and judea were considered and rejected 44 in the early weeks of independence the government chose the term israeli to denote a citizen of israel with the formal announcement made by minister of foreign affairs moshe sharett 45 the names land of israel and children of israel have historically been used to refer to the biblical kingdom of israel and the entire jewish people respectively 46 the name israel standardyisraʾel isrāʾīl septuagint greek ἰσραήλ israēl elgod persistsrules though after hosea 12:4 often interpreted as struggle with god 47 48 49 50 in these phrases refers to the patriarch jacob who according to the hebrew bible was given the name after he successfully wrestled with the angel of the lord 51 jacobs twelve sons became the ancestors of the israelites also known as the twelve tribes of israel or children of israel jacob and his sons had lived in canaan but were forced by famine to go into egypt for four generations lasting 430 years 52 until moses a great-great grandson of jacob 53 led the israelites back into canaan during the exodus the earliest known archaeological artifact to mention the word israel is the merneptah stele of ancient egypt dated to the late 13th century bce 54 the area is also known as the holy land being holy for all abrahamic religions including judaism christianity islam and the baháí faith from 1920 the whole region was known as palestine under british mandatenote 3 until the israeli declaration of independence of 1948 55 through the centuries the territory was known by a variety of other names including judea samaria southern syria syria palaestina kingdom of jerusalem iudaea province coele-syria djahy and canaan history antiquity the notion of the land of israel known in hebrew as eretz yisrael has been important and sacred to the jewish people since biblical times according to the torah god promised the land to the three patriarchs of the jewish people 56 57 on the basis of scripture the period of the three patriarchs has been placed somewhere in the early 2nd millenniumbce 58 and the first kingdom of israel was established around the 11th century bce subsequent israelite kingdoms and states ruled intermittently over the next four hundred years and are known from various extra-biblical sources 59 60 61 62 the first record of the name israel as ysrỉꜣr occurs in the merneptah stele erected for egyptian pharaoh merneptah c 1209 bce israel is laid waste and his seed is not 63 this israel was a cultural and probably political entity of the central highlands well enough established to be perceived by the egyptians as a possible challenge to their hegemony but an ethnic group rather than an organised state 64 ancestors of the israelites may have included semites native to canaan and the sea peoples 65 mcnutt says it is probably safe to assume that sometime during iron age a population began to identify itself as israelite differentiating itself from the canaanites through such markers as the prohibition of intermarriage an emphasis on family history and genealogy and religion 66 villages had populations of up to 300 or 400 67 68 which lived by farming and herding and were largely self-sufficient 69 economic interchange was prevalent 70 writing was known and available for recording even in small sites 71 the archaeological evidence indicates a society of village-like centres but with more limited resources and a small population 72 modern scholars see israel arising peacefully and internally from existing people in the highlands of canaan 73 around 930 bce the kingdom split into a southern kingdom of judah and a northern kingdom of israel from the middle of the 8th century bce israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding neo-assyrian empire under tiglath-pileser iii it first split israels territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital samaria  722 bce an israelite revolt  724–722 bce was crushed after the siege and capture of samaria by the assyrian king sargon ii sargons son sennacherib tried and failed to conquer judah assyrian records say he leveled 46 walled cities and besieged jerusalem leaving after receiving extensive tribute 74 in 586 bce king nebuchadnezzar ii of babylon conquered judah according to the hebrew bible he destroyed solomons temple and exiled the jews to babylon the defeat was also recorded by the babylonians 75 76 see the babylonian chronicles in 538 bce cyrus the great of persia conquered babylon and took over its empire cyrus issued a proclamation granting subjugated nations including the people of judah religious freedom for the original text which corroborates the biblical narrative only in very broad terms see the cyrus cylinder according to the hebrew bible 50,000 judeans led by zerubabel returned to judah and rebuilt the temple a second group of 5,000 led by ezra and nehemiah returned to judah in 456 bce although non-jews wrote to cyrus to try to prevent their return classical period with successive persian rule the region divided between syria-coele province and later the autonomous yehud medinata was gradually developing back into urban society largely dominated by judeans the greek conquests largely skipped the region without any resistance or interest incorporated into ptolemaic and finally seleucid empires the southern levant was heavily hellenized building the tensions between judeans and greeks the conflict erupted in 167 bce with the maccabean revolt which succeeded in establishing an independent hasmonean kingdom in judah which later expanded over much of modern israel as the seleucids gradually lost control in the region the roman empire invaded the region in 63 bce first taking control of syria and then intervening in the hasmonean civil war the struggle between pro-roman and pro-parthian factions in judea eventually led to the installation of herod the great and consolidation of the herodian kingdom as a vassal judean state of rome with the decline of herodians judea transformed into a roman province became the site of a violent struggle of jews against greco-romans culminating in the jewish-roman wars ending in wide-scale destruction expulsions and genocide jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled after the failure of the bar kokhba revolt against the roman empire in 132 ce 77 nevertheless there was a continuous small jewish presence and galilee became its religious center 78 79 the mishnah and part of the talmud central jewish texts were composed during the 2nd to 4th centuries ce in tiberias and jerusalem 80 the region came to be populated predominantly by greco-romans on the coast and samaritans in the hill-country christianity was gradually evolving over roman paganism when the area stood under byzantine rule through the 5th and 6th centuries the dramatic events of the repeated samaritan revolts reshaped the land with massive destruction to byzantine christian and samaritan societies and a resulting decrease of the population after the persian conquest and the installation of a short-lived jewish commonwealth in 614 ce the byzantine empire reconquered the country in 628 middle ages and modern history in 634–641 ce the region including jerusalem was conquered by the arabs who had just recently adopted islam it remained under muslim control for the next 1,300 years under various dynasties 82 control of the region transferred between the rashidun caliphs umayyads 82 abbasids 82 fatimids seljuks crusaders and ayyubids throughout the next six centuries 82 before the area was conquered in 1260 by the mamluk sultanate 83 during the siege of jerusalem by the first crusade in 1099 the jewish inhabitants of the city fought side by side with the fatimid garrison and the muslim population who tried in vain to defend the city against the crusaders when the city fell about 60,000 people were massacred including 6,000 jews seeking refuge in a synagogue 84 at this time a full thousand years after the fall of the jewish state there were jewish communities all over the country fifty of them are known and include jerusalem tiberias ramleh ashkelon caesarea and gaza 85 according to albert of aachen the jewish residents of haifa were the main fighting force of the city and mixed with saracen fatimid troops they fought bravely for close to a month until forced into retreat by the crusader fleet and land army 86 87 however joshua prawer expressed doubt over the story noting that albert did not attend the crusades and that such a prominent role for the jews is not mentioned by any other source 88undue weight  discuss in 1165 maimonides visited jerusalem and prayed on the temple mount in the great holy house 90 in 1141 the spanish-jewish poet yehuda halevi issued a call for jews to migrate to the land of israel a journey he undertook himself in 1187 sultan saladin founder of the ayyubid dynasty defeated the crusaders in the battle of hattin and subsequently captured jerusalem and almost all of palestine in time saladin issued a proclamation inviting jews to return and settle in jerusalem 91 and according to judah al-harizi they did from the day the arabs took jerusalem the israelites inhabited it 92 al-harizi compared saladins decree allowing jews to re-establish themselves in jerusalem to the one issued by the persian king cyrus the great over 1,600 years earlier 93 in 1211 the jewish community in the country was strengthened by the arrival of a group headed by over 300 rabbis from france and england 94 among them rabbi samson ben abraham of sens 95 nachmanides the 13th-century spanish rabbi and recognised leader of jewry greatly praised the land of israel and viewed its settlement as a positive commandment incumbent on all jews he wrote if the gentiles wish to make peace we shall make peace and leave them on clear terms but as for the land we shall not leave it in their hands nor in the hands of any nation not in any generation 96 in 1260 control passed to the mamluk sultans of egypt the country was located between the two centres of mamluk power cairo and damascus and only saw some development along the postal road connecting the two cities jerusalem although left without the protection of any city walls since 1219 also saw a flurry of new construction projects centred around the al-aqsa mosque compound the temple mount in 1266 the mamluk sultan baybars converted the cave of the patriarchs in hebron into an exclusive islamic sanctuary and banned christians and jews from entering which previously would be able to enter it for a fee the ban remained in place until israel took control of the building in 1967 97 98 in 1470 isaac b meir latif arrived from ancona and counted 150 jewish families in jerusalem 99 thanks to joseph saragossi who had arrived in the closing years of the 15th century safed and its environs had developed into the largest concentration of jews in palestine with the help of the sephardic immigration from spain the jewish population had increased to 10,000 by the early 16th century 100 in 1516 the region was conquered by the ottoman empire it remained under turkish rule until the end of the first world war when britain defeated the ottoman forces and set up a military administration across the former ottoman syria in 1920 the territory was divided between britain and france under the mandate system and the british-administered area which included modern day israel was named mandatory palestine 83 101 102 zionism and british mandate since the existence of the earliest jewish diaspora many jews have aspired to return to zion and the land of israel 103 though the amount of effort that should be spent towards such an aim was a matter of dispute 104 105 the hopes and yearnings of jews living in exile are an important theme of the jewish belief system 104 after the jews were expelled from spain in 1492 some communities settled in palestine 106 during the 16th century jewish communities struck roots in the four holy citiesjerusalem tiberias hebron and safedand in 1697 rabbi yehuda hachasid led a group of 1,500 jews to jerusalem 107 in the second half of the 18th century eastern european opponents of hasidism known as the perushim settled in palestine 108 109 110 i believe that a wondrous generation of jews will spring into existence the maccabeans will rise again let me repeat once more my opening words the jews who wish for a state will have it we shall live at last as free men on our own soil and die peacefully in our own homes the world will be freed by our liberty enriched by our wealth magnified by our greatness and whatever we attempt there to accomplish for our own welfare will react powerfully and beneficially for the good of humanity the first wave of modern jewish migration to ottoman-ruled palestine known as the first aliyah began in 1881 as jews fled pogroms in eastern europe 112 although the zionist movement already existed in practice austro-hungarian journalist theodor herzl is credited with founding political zionism 113 a movement which sought to establish a jewish state in the land of israel thus offering a solution to the so-called jewish question of the european states in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time 114 in 1896 herzl published der judenstaat the state of the jews offering his vision of a future jewish state the following year he presided over the first zionist congress 115 the second aliyah  1904–14 began after the kishinev pogrom some 40,000 jews settled in palestine although nearly half of them left eventually 112 both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly orthodox jews 116 although the second aliyah included socialist groups who established the kibbutz movement 117 during world war i british foreign secretary arthur balfour sent the balfour declaration of 1917 to baron rothschild walter rothschild 2nd baron rothschild a leader of the british jewish community that stated that britain intended for the creation of a jewish national home within the palestinian mandate 118 119 the jewish legion a group primarily of zionist volunteers assisted in 1918 in the british conquest of palestine 120 arab opposition to british rule and jewish immigration led to the 1920 palestine riots and the formation of a jewish militia known as the haganah meaning the defense in hebrew from which the irgun and lehi or stern gang paramilitary groups later split off 121 in 1922 the league of nations granted britain a mandate over palestine under terms which included the balfour declaration with its promise to the jews and with similar provisions regarding the arab palestinians 122 the population of the area at this time was predominantly arab and muslim with jews accounting for about 11 123 and arab christians at about 9.5 of the population 124 the third  1919–23 and fourth aliyahs  1924–29 brought an additional 100,000 jews to palestine 112 finally the rise of nazism and the increasing persecution of jews in 1930s europe led to the fifth aliyah with an influx of a quarter of a million jews this was a major cause of the arab revolt of 1936–39 during which the british mandate authorities alongside the zionist militias of haganah and irgun killed 5,032 arabs and wounded 14,760 125 126 resulting in over ten percent of the adult male palestinian arab population killed wounded imprisoned or exiled 127 the british introduced restrictions on jewish immigration to palestine with the white paper of 1939 with countries around the world turning away jewish refugees fleeing the holocaust a clandestine movement known as aliyah bet was organized to bring jews to palestine 112 by the end of world war ii the jewish population of palestine had increased to 33 of the total population 128 after world war ii after world war ii britain found itself in intense conflict with the jewish community over jewish immigration limits as well as continued conflict with the arab community over limit levels the haganah joined irgun and lehi in an armed struggle against british rule 129 at the same time hundreds of thousands of jewish holocaust survivors and refugees sought a new life far from their destroyed communities in europe the yishuv attempted to bring these refugees to palestine but many were turned away or rounded up and placed in detention camps in atlit and cyprus by the british on july 22 1946 irgun attacked the british administrative headquarters for palestine which was housed in the southern wing 130 of the king david hotel in jerusalem 131 132 133 91 people of various nationalities were killed and 46 were injured 134 the hotel was the site of the central offices of the british mandatory authorities of palestine principally the secretariat of the government of palestine and the headquarters of the british armed forces in palestine and transjordan 134 135 the attack initially had the approval of the haganah the principal jewish paramilitary group in palestine it was conceived as a response to operation agatha a series of widespread raids including one on the jewish agency conducted by the british authorities and was the deadliest directed at the british during the mandate era  1920–1948 134 135 bruce hoffman characterized as one of the most lethal terrorist incidents of the twentieth century 136 in 1947 the british government announced it would withdraw from mandatory palestine stating it was unable to arrive at a solution acceptable to both arabs and jews on 15 may 1947 the general assembly of the newly formed united nations resolved that a committee united nations special committee on palestine unscop be created to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the assembly a report on the question of palestine 137 in the report of the committee dated 3 september 1947 to the un general assembly 138 the majority of the committee in chapter vi proposed a plan to replace the british mandate with an independent arab state an independent jewish state and the city of jerusalem  the last to be under an international trusteeship system 139 on 29 november 1947 the general assembly adopted a resolution recommending the adoption and implementation of the plan of partition with economic union as resolution 181 ii 140 the plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed by the majority of the committee in the report of 3 september 1947 the jewish agency which was the recognized representative of the jewish community accepted the plan the arab league and arab higher committee of palestine rejected it and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition 141 142 on the following day 1 december 1947 the arab higher committee proclaimed a three-day strike and arab gangs began attacking jewish targets 143 the jews were initially on the defensive as civil war broke out but in early april 1948 moved onto the offensive 144 145 the arab palestinian economy collapsed and 250,000 palestinian arabs fled or were expelled 146 on 14 may 1948 the day before the expiration of the british mandate david ben-gurion the head of the jewish agency declared the establishment of a jewish state in eretz-israel to be known as the state of israel 147 148 the only reference in the text of the declaration to the borders of the new state is the use of the term eretz-israel land of israel 149 the following day the armies of four arab countriesegypt syria transjordan and iraqentered what had been british mandatory palestine launching the 1948 arabisraeli war 150 151 contingents from yemen morocco saudi arabia and sudan joined the war 152 153 the apparent purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the jewish state at inception and some arab leaders talked about driving the jews into the sea 154 155 156 according to benny morris jews felt that the invading arab armies aimed to slaughter the jews 157 the arab league stated that the invasion was to restore law and order and to prevent further bloodshed 158 after a year of fighting a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders known as the green line were established 159 jordan annexed what became known as the west bank including east jerusalem and egypt took control of the gaza strip the united nations estimated that more than 700,000 palestinians were expelled by or fled from advancing israeli forces during the conflictwhat would become known in arabic as the nakba catastrophe 160 first years of the state of israel israel was admitted as a member of the united nations by majority vote on 11 may 1949 161 on 1949 both israel and jordan were genuinely interested in a peace agreement but the british acted as a brake on the jordanian effort in order to avoid damaging british interests in egypt 162 in the early years of the state the labor zionist movement led by prime minister david ben-gurion dominated israeli politics 163 164 the kibbutzim or collective farming communities played a pivotal role in establishing the new state 165 immigration to israel during the late 1940s and early 1950s was aided by the israeli immigration department and the non-government sponsored mossad lealiyah bet institution for illegal immigration 166 both groups facilitated regular immigration logistics like arranging transportation but the latter also engaged in clandestine operations in countries particularly in the middle east and eastern europe where the lives of jews were believed to be in danger and exit from those places was difficult mossad lealiyah bet continued to take part in immigration efforts until its disbanding in 1953 167 an influx of holocaust survivors and jews from arab and muslim lands immigrated to israel during the first 3 years and the number of jews increased from 700,000 to 1,400,000 168 many of whom faced persecution in their original countries 169 the immigration was in accordance with the one million plan consequently the population of israel rose from 800,000 to two million between 1948 and 1958 168 between 1948 and 1970 approximately 1,150,000 jewish refugees relocated to israel 170 the immigrants came to israel for differing reasons some believed in a zionist ideology while others moved to escape persecution there were others that did it for the promise of a better life in israel and a small number that were expelled from their homelands such as british and french jews in egypt after the suez crisis 171 some new immigrants arrived as refugees with no possessions and were housed in temporary camps known as maabarot by 1952 over 200,000 immigrants were living in these tent cities 172 during this period food clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the austerity period the need to solve the crisis led ben-gurion to sign a reparations agreement with west germany that triggered mass protests by jews angered at the idea that israel could accept monetary compensation for the holocaust 173 in 1950 egypt closed the suez canal to israeli shipping and tensions mounted as armed clashes took place along israels borders during the 1950s israel was frequently attacked by palestinian fedayeen nearly always against civilians 174 mainly from the egyptian-occupied gaza strip 175 leading to several israeli counter-raids in 1956 great britain and france aimed at regaining control of the suez canal which the egyptians had nationalized see the suez crisis the continued blockade of the suez canal and straits of tiran to israeli shipping together with the growing amount of fedayeen attacks against israels southern population and recent arab grave and threatening statements prompted israel to attack egypt 176 177 178 179 israel joined a secret alliance with great britain and france and overran the sinai peninsula but was pressured to withdraw by the united nations in return for guarantees of israeli shipping rights in the red sea via the straits of tiran and the canalcitation needed 180 181 the war resulted in significant reduction of israeli border infiltration 182 183 184 185 the refugees were often treated differently according to where they had come from jews of european background were treated more favorably than jews from middle eastern and north african countrieshousing units reserved for the latter were often re-designated for the former with the result that jews newly arrived from arab lands generally ended up staying in transit camps for longer 186 tensions that developed between the two groups over such discrimination persist to the present day 187 in the early 1960s israel captured nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in argentina and brought him to israel for trial 188 the trial had a major impact on public awareness of the holocaust 189 eichmann remains the only person executed in israel by conviction by an israeli civilian court 190 six-day war and yom kippur war since 1964 arab countries concerned over israeli plans to divert waters of the jordan river into the coastal plain 191 had been trying to divert the headwaters to deprive israel of water resources provoking tensions between israel on the one hand and syria and lebanon on the other arab nationalists led by egyptian president gamal abdel nasser refused to recognize israel and called for its destruction 21 192 193 by 1966 israeli-arab relations had deteriorated to the point of actual battles taking place between israeli and arab forces 194 in may 1967 egypt massed its army near the border with israel expelled un peacekeepers stationed in the sinai peninsula since 1957 and blocked israels access to the red seacitation needed other arab states mobilized their forces 195 israel reiterated that these actions were a casus belli on 5 june 1967 israel launched a pre-emptive strike against egypt jordan syria and iraq responded and attacked israel in a six-day war israel defeated jordan and captured the west bank defeated egypt and captured the gaza strip and sinai peninsula and defeated syria and captured the golan heights 196 jerusalems boundaries were enlarged incorporating east jerusalem and the 1949 green line became the administrative boundary between israel and the occupied territories following the 1967 war and the three nos resolution of the arab league during the 1967–1970 war of attrition israel faced attacks from the egyptians in the sinai and from palestinian groups targeting israelis in the occupied territories in israel proper and around the world most important among the various palestinian and arab groups was the palestinian liberation organization plo established in 1964 which initially committed itself to armed struggle as the only way to liberate the homeland 197 198 in the late 1960s and early 1970s palestinian groups launched a wave of attacks 199 200 against israeli and jewish targets around the world 201 including a massacre of israeli athletes at the 1972 summer olympics in munich the israeli government responded with an assassination campaign against the organizers of the massacre a bombing and a raid on the plo headquarters in lebanon on 6 october 1973 as jews were observing yom kippur the egyptian and syrian armies launched a surprise attack against israeli forces in the sinai peninsula and golan heights that opened the yom kippur war the war ended on 26 october with israel successfully repelling egyptian and syrian forces but having suffered over 2,500 soldiers killed in a war which collectively took

control from the labor party 204 later that year egyptian president anwar el sadat made a trip to israel and spoke before the knesset in what was the first recognition of israel by an arab head of state 205 in the two years that followed sadat and begin signed the camp david accords  1978 and the israelegypt peace treaty  1979 206 in return israel withdrew from the sinai peninsula which israel had captured during the six-day war in 1967 and agreed to enter negotiations over an autonomy for palestinians in the west bank and the gaza strip 207 on 11 march 1978 a plo guerilla raid from lebanon led to the coastal road massacre israel responded by launching an invasion of southern lebanon to destroy the plo bases south of the litani river most plo fighters withdrew but israel was able to secure southern lebanon until a un force and the lebanese army could take over the plo soon resumed its policy of attacks against israel in the next few years the plo infiltrated the south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks by air and on the ground meanwhile begins government provided incentives for israelis to settle in the occupied west bank increasing friction with the palestinians in that area 208 the basic law jerusalem the capital of israel passed in 1980 was believed by some to reaffirm israels 1967 annexation of jerusalem by government decree and reignited international controversy over the status of the city no israeli legislation has defined the territory of israel and no act specifically included east jerusalem therein 209 the position of the majority of un member states is reflected in numerous resolutions declaring that actions taken by israel to settle its citizens in the west bank and impose its laws and administration on east jerusalem are illegal and have no validity 210 in 1981 israel annexed the golan heights although annexation was not recognized internationally 211 on 7 june 1981 the israeli air force destroyed iraqs sole nuclear reactor in order to impede iraqs nuclear weapons program the reactor was under construction just outside baghdad following a series of plo attacks in 1982 israel invaded lebanon that year to destroy the bases from which the plo launched attacks and missiles into northern israel 212 in the first six days of fighting the israelis destroyed the military forces of the plo in lebanon and decisively defeated the syrians an israeli government inquiry the kahan commission would later hold begin sharon and several israeli generals as indirectly responsible for the sabra and shatila massacre in 1985 israel responded to a palestinian terrorist attack in cyprus by bombing the plo headquarters in tunis israel withdrew from most of lebanon in 1986 but maintained a borderland buffer zone in southern lebanon until 2000 from where israeli forces engaged in conflict with hezbollah israels ethnic diversity expanded in the 1980s and 1990s due to immigration several waves of ethiopian jews immigrated to israel in the 1980s and 1990s while between 1990 and 1994 russian immigration to israel increased israels population by twelve percent 213 the first intifada a palestinian uprising against israeli rule 214 broke out in 1987 with waves of uncoordinated demonstrations and violence occurring in the occupied west bank and gaza over the following six years the intifada became more organised and included economic and cultural measures aimed at disrupting the israeli occupation more than a thousand people were killed in the violence 215 during the 1991 gulf war the plo supported saddam hussein and iraqi scud missile attacks against israel despite public outrage israel heeded us calls to refrain from hitting back and did not participate in that war 216 217 in 1992 yitzhak rabin became prime minister following an election in which his party called for compromise with israels neighbors 218 219 the following year shimon peres on behalf of israel and mahmoud abbas for the plo signed the oslo accords which gave the palestinian national authority the right to govern parts of the west bank and the gaza strip 220 the plo also recognized israels right to exist and pledged an end to terrorism 221 in 1994 the israeljordan treaty of peace was signed making jordan the second arab country to normalize relations with israel 222 arab public support for the accords was damaged by the continuation of israeli settlements 223 and checkpoints and the deterioration of economic conditions 224 israeli public support for the accords waned as israel was struck by palestinian suicide attacks 225 finally while leaving a peace rally in november 1995 yitzhak rabin was assassinated by a far-right-wing jew who opposed the accords 226 at the end of the 1990s israel under the leadership of benjamin netanyahu withdrew from hebron 227 and signed the wye river memorandum giving greater control to the palestinian national authority 228 ehud barak elected prime minister in 1999 began the new millennium by withdrawing forces from southern lebanon and conducting negotiations with palestinian authority chairman yasser arafat and us president bill clinton at the 2000 camp david summit during the summit barak offered a plan for the establishment of a palestinian state the proposed state included the entirety of the gaza strip and over 90 of the west bank with jerusalem as a shared capital 229 although some argue that the plan was to annex areas which would lead to a cantonization of the west bank into three blocs which the palestinian delegation likened to south african bantustans a loaded word that was disputed by the israeli and american negotiators 230 each side blamed the other for the failure of the talks after the collapse of the talks and a controversial visit by likud leader ariel sharon to the temple mount the second intifada began some commentators contend that the uprising was pre-planned by yasser arafat due to the collapse of peace talks 231 232 233 234 sharon became prime minister in a 2001 special election during his tenure sharon carried out his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the gaza strip and also spearheaded the construction of the israeli west bank barrier 235 ending the intifada 236 237 by this time 1,100 israelis had been killed mostly in suicide bombings 238 the palestinian fatalities by 30 april 2008 reached 4,745 killed by israeli security forces 44 killed by israeli civilians and 577 killed by palestinians 239 in july 2006 a hezbollah artillery assault on israels northern border communities and a cross-border abduction of two israeli soldiers precipitated the month-long second lebanon war 240 241 on 6 september 2007 the israeli air force destroyed a nuclear reactor in syria in may 2008 israel confirmed it had been discussing a peace treaty with syria for a year with turkey as a go-between 242 however at the end of the year israel entered another conflict as a ceasefire between hamas and israel collapsed the gaza war lasted three weeks and ended after israel announced a unilateral ceasefire 243 244 hamas announced its own ceasefire with its own conditions of complete withdrawal and opening of border crossings despite neither the rocket launchings nor israeli retaliatory strikes having completely stopped the fragile ceasefire remained in order 245 in what israel described as a response to more than a hundred palestinian rocket attacks on southern israeli cities 246 israel began an operation in gaza on 14 november 2012 lasting eight days 247 israel started another operation in gaza following an escalation of rocket attacks by hamas in july 2014 248 geography and environment v t e israel is at the eastern end of the mediterranean sea bounded by lebanon to the north syria to the northeast jordan and the west bank to the east and egypt and the gaza strip to the southwest it lies between latitudes 29 and 34 n and longitudes 34 and 36 e the sovereign territory of israel according to the demarcation lines of the 1949 armistice agreements and excluding all territories captured by israel during the 1967 six-day war is approximately 20,770 square kilometers  8,019sqmi in area of which twopercent is water 8 however israel is so narrow that the exclusive economic zone in the mediterranean is double the land area of the country 249 the total area under israeli law including east jerusalem and the golan heights is 22,072 square kilometers  8,522sqmi 250 and the total area under israeli control including the military-controlled and partially palestinian-governed territory of the west bank is 27,799 square kilometers  10,733sqmi 251 despite its small size israel is home to a variety of geographic features from the negev desert in the south to the inland fertile jezreel valley mountain ranges of the galilee carmel and toward the golan in the north the israeli coastal plain on the shores of the mediterranean is home to 57 percent of the nations population 252 253 254 east of the central highlands lies the jordan rift valley which forms a small part of the 6,500-kilometer  4,039mi great rift valley the jordan river runs along the jordan rift valley from mount hermon through the hulah valley and the sea of galilee to the dead sea the lowest point on the surface of the earth 255 further south is the arabah ending with the gulf of eilat part of the red sea unique to israel and the sinai peninsula are makhteshim or erosion cirques 256 the largest makhtesh in the world is ramon crater in the negev 257 which measures 40 by 8 kilometers  25 by 5mi 258 a report on the environmental status of the mediterranean basin states that israel has the largest number of plant species per square meter of all the countries in the basin 259 tectonics and seismicity the jordan rift valley is the result of tectonic movements within the dead sea transform dsf fault system the dsf forms the transform boundary between the african plate to the west and the arabian plate to the east the golan heights and all of jordan are part of the arabian plate while the galilee west bank coastal plain and negev along with the sinai peninsula are on the african plate this tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity in the region the entire jordan valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly for instance during the last two major earthquakes along this structure in 749 and 1033 the deficit in slip that has built up since the 1033 event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of mw~7.4 260 the most catastrophic earthquakes we know of occurred in 31 bce 363 749 and 1033 ce that is every ca 400 years on average 261 destructive earthquakes leading to serious loss of life strike about every 80 years 262 while stringent construction regulations are currently in place and recently built structures are earthquake-safe as of 2007update the majority of the buildings in israel were older than these regulations and many public buildings as well as 50,000 residential buildings did not meet the new standards and were expected to collapse if exposed to a strong quake 262 given the fragile political situation of the middle east region and the presence there of major holy sites a quake reaching magnitude 7 on the richter scale could have dire consequences for world peace 261 climate temperatures in israel vary widely especially during the winter coastal areas such as those of tel aviv and haifa have a typical mediterranean climate with cool rainy winters and long hot summers the area of beersheba and the northern negev has a semi-arid climate with hot summers cool winters and fewer rainy days than the mediterranean climate the southern negev and the arava areas have desert climate with very hot and dry summers and mild winters with few days of rain the highest temperature in the continent of asia  54.0c or 129.2f was recorded in 1942 at tirat zvi kibbutz in the northern jordan river valley 263 264 at the other extreme mountainous regions can be windy cold and areas at elevation of 750 meters or more same elevation as jerusalem will usually receive at least one snowfall each year 265 from may to september rain in israel is rare 266 267 with scarce water resources israel has developed various water-saving technologies including drip irrigation 268 israelis also take advantage of the considerable sunlight available for solar energy making israel the leading nation in solar energy use per capita practically every house uses solar panels for water heating 269 four different phytogeographic regions exist in israel due to the countrys location between the temperate and the tropical zones bordering the mediterranean sea in the west and the desert in the east for this reason the flora and fauna of israel is extremely diverse there are 2,867 known species of plants found in israel of these at least 253 species are introduced and non-native 270 there are 380 israeli nature reserves 271 tiberias and the sea of galilee field of anemone coronaria national flower of israel ramon crater a unique type of crater that can be found only in israel and the sinai peninsula snow in

1,775,400 arabs comprised 20.8 of the population while non-arab christians and people who have no religion listed in the civil registry made up 4.4 1 2 over the last decade large numbers of migrant workers from romania thailand china africa and south america have settled in israel exact figures are unknown as many of them are living in the country illegally 273 but estimates run in the region of 203,000 32 by june 2012 approximately 60,000 african migrants had entered israel 274 about 92 of israelis live in urban areas 275 retention of israels population since 1948 is about even or greater when compared to other countries with mass immigration 276 jewish emigration from israel called yerida in hebrew primarily to the united states and canada is described by demographers as modest 277 but is often cited by israeli government ministries as a major threat to israels future 278 279 in 2009update over 300,000 israeli citizens lived in west bank settlements 280 such as maale adumim and ariel including settlements that predated the establishment of the state of israel and which were re-established after the six-day war in cities such as hebron and gush etzion in 2011 there were 250,000 jews living in east jerusalem 281 20,000 israelis live in golan heights settlements 211 the total number of israeli settlers is over 500,000  6.5 of the israeli population approximately 7,800 israelis lived in settlements in the gaza strip until they were evacuated by the government as part of its 2005 disengagement plan 282 israel was established as a homeland for the jewish people and is often referred to as a jewish state the countrys law of return grants all jews and those of jewish ancestry the right to israeli citizenship 283 over three quarters or 75.5 of the population are jews from a diversity of jewish backgrounds around 4 of israelis  300,000 ethnically defined as others are russian descendants of jewish origin or family who are not jewish according to rabbinical law but were eligible for israeli citizenship under the law of return 284 285 286 approximately 76 of israeli jews are born in israel 16 are immigrants from europe and the americas and 8 are immigrants from asia and africa including the arab world 287 jews from europe and the former soviet union and their descendants born in israel including ashkenazi jews constitute approximately 50 of jewish israelis jews who left or fled arab and muslim countries and their descendants including both mizrahi and sephardi jews 288 form most of the rest of the jewish population 289 290 291 jewish intermarriage rates run at over 35 and recent studies suggest that the percentage of israelis descended from both sephardi and ashkenazi jews increases by 0.5 percent every year with over 25 of school children now originating from both communities 292 v t e athis number includes east jerusalem and west bank areas israeli sovereignty over east jerusalem is internationally unrecognized language israel has two official languages hebrew and arabic 8 hebrew is the primary language of the state and is spoken every day by the majority of the population arabic is spoken by the arab minority with hebrew taught in arab schools as a country of immigrants many languages can be heard on the streets due to mass immigration from the former soviet union and ethiopia some 130,000 ethiopian jews live in israel 294 295 russian and amharic are widely spoken 296 more than one million russian-speaking immigrants arrived in israel from the former soviet union states between 1990 and 2004 297 french is spoken by around 700,000 israelis 298 mostly originating from france and north africa see maghrebi jews english was an official language during the mandate period it lost this status after the creation of israel but retains a role comparable to that of an official language 299 300 301 as may be seen in road signs and official documents many israelis communicate reasonably well in english as many television programs are broadcast in english with subtitles and the language is taught from the early grades in elementary school in addition israeli universities offer courses in the english language on various subjects 302 religion israel comprises a major part of the holy land a region of significant importance to all abrahamic religions judaism christianity islam druze and baháí faith the religious affiliation of israeli jews varies widely a social survey for those over the age of 20 indicates that 55 say they are traditional while 20 consider themselves secular jews 17 define themselves as religious zionists 8 define themselves as haredi jews 303 haredi jews are expected to represent more than 20 of israels jewish population by 2028 304 making up 16 of the population muslims constitute israels largest religious minority about 2 of the population is christian and 1.5 is druze 306 the christian population primarily comprises arab christians but also includes post-soviet immigrants the foreign laborers of multinational origins and followers of messianic judaism considered by most christians and jews to be a form of christianity 307 members of many other religious groups including buddhists and hindus maintain a presence in israel albeit in small numbers 308 out of more than one million immigrants from the former soviet union in israel about 300,000 are considered not jewish by the orthodox rabbinate 309 the city of jerusalem is of special importance to jews muslims and christians as it is the home of sites that are pivotal to their religious beliefs such as the old city that incorporates the western wall and the temple mount the al-aqsa mosque and the church of the holy sepulchre 310 other locations of religious importance in israel are nazareth holy in christianity as the site of the annunciation of mary tiberias and safed two of the four holy cities in judaism the white mosque in ramla holy in islam as the shrine of the prophet saleh and the church of saint george in lod holy in christianity and islam as the tomb of saint george or al khidr a number of other religious landmarks are located in the west bank among them josephs tomb in nablus the birthplace of jesus and rachels tomb in bethlehem and the cave of the patriarchs in hebron the administrative center of the baháí faith and the shrine of the báb are located at the baháí world centre in haifa the leader of the faith is buried in acre apart from maintenance staff there is no baháí community in israel although it is a destination for pilgrimages baháí staff in israel do not teach their faith to israelis following strict policy 311 312 313 a few miles south of the baháí world centre is the middle east centre of the reformist ahmadiyya movement its mixed neighbourhood of jews and ahmadi arabs is the only one of its kind in the country 314 315 education education in israel is highly valued in the national culture with its historical values dating back to ancient israel and was viewed as one fundamental blocks of ancient israelite life 316 jewish communities in the levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community not less than the parents was responsible for the education of the next generation of jews 317 the israeli education system has been praised for various reasons including its high quality and its major role in spurring israels economic development and technological boom 318 many international business leaders and organizations such as microsoft founder bill gates have praised israel for its high quality of education in helping spur israels economic development 319 320 as the israeli economy is largely scientific and technological based the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment in 2012 the country ranked second among oecd countries tied with japan and after canada for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 46 percent compared with the oecd average of 32 percent in addition nearly twice as many israelis aged 55–64 held a higher education degree compared to other oecd countries with 47 percent holding an academic degree compared with the oecd average of 25 38 39 in 2012 the country ranked third in the world in the number of academic degrees per capita  20 percent of the population 321 322 israel has a school life expectancy of 15.5 years 323 and a literacy rate of 97.1 according to the united nations 324 the state education law passed in 1953 established five types of schools state secular state religious ultra orthodox communal settlement schools and arab schools the public secular is the largest school group and is attended by the majority of jewish and non-arab pupils in israel most arabs send their children to schools where arabic is the language of instruction 325 education is compulsory in israel for children between the ages of three and eighteen 326 327 schooling is divided into three tiers primary school grades 1–6 middle school grades 7–9 and high school grades 10–12 culminating with bagrut matriculation exams proficiency in core subjects such as mathematics the hebrew language hebrew and general literature the english language history biblical scripture and civics is necessary to receive a bagrut certificate 328 in arab christian and druze schools the exam on biblical studies is replaced by an exam on muslim christian or druze heritage 329 maariv have describe the christian arabs sectors as the most successful in education system 330 since christian arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group in israel 331 israeli children from russian-speaking families have a higher bagrut pass rate at high-school level 332 although amongst immigrant children born in the former soviet union the bagrut pass rate is highest amongst those families from european fsu states at 62.6 and lower amongst those from central asian and caucasian fsu states 333 in 2003 over half of all israeli twelfth graders earned a matriculation certificate

west bank is the newest university institution upgraded from college status and the first in over thirty years israels seven research universities excluding the open university are consistently ranked among top 500 in the world 344 politics israel operates under a parliamentary system as a democratic republic with universal suffrage 8 a member of parliament supported by a parliamentary majority becomes the prime ministerusually this is the chair of the largest party the prime minister is the head of government and head of the cabinet 345 346 israel is governed by a 120-member parliament known as the knesset membership of the knesset is based on proportional representation of political parties 347 with a 3.25 electoral threshold which in practice has resulted in coalition governments parliamentary elections are scheduled every four years but unstable coalitions or a no-confidence vote by the knesset can dissolve a government earlier the basic laws of israel function as an uncodified constitution in 2003 the knesset began to draft an official constitution based on these laws 8 348 the president of israel is head of state with limited and largely ceremonial duties 345 israel has no official religion 349 350 351 but the definition of the state as jewish and democratic creates a strong connection with judaism as well as a conflict between state law and religious law interaction between the political parties keeps the balance between state and religion largely as it existed during the british mandate 352 legal system israel has a three-tier court system at the lowest level are magistrate courts situated in most cities across the country above them are district courts serving as both appellate courts and courts of first instance they are situated in five of israels six districts the third and highest tier is the supreme court located in jerusalem it serves a dual role as the highest court of appeals and the high court of justice in the latter role the supreme court rules as a court of first instance allowing individuals both citizens and non-citizens to petition against the decisions of state authorities 353 354 although israel supports the goals of the international criminal court it has not ratified the rome statute citing concerns about the ability of the court to remain free from political impartiality 355 israels legal system combines three legal traditions english common law civil law and jewish law 8 it is based on the principle of stare decisis precedent and is an adversarial system where the parties in the suit bring evidence before the court court cases are decided by professional judges rather than juries 353 marriage and divorce are under the jurisdiction of the religious courts jewish muslim druze and christian the election of judges is carried out by a committee of two knesset members three supreme court justices two israeli bar members and two ministers one of which israels justice minister is the committees chairman the committees members of the knesset are secretly elected by the knesset and one of them is traditionally a member of the opposition the committees supreme court justices are chosen by tradition from all supreme court justices by seniority the israeli bar members are elected by the bar and the second minister is appointed by the israeli cabinet the current justice minister and committees chairwoman is ayelet shaked 356 357 358 administration of israels courts both the general courts and the labor courts is carried by the administration of courts situated in jerusalem both general and labor courts are paperless courts the storage of court files as well as court decisions are conducted electronically israels basic law human dignity and liberty seeks to defend human rights and liberties in israel administrative divisions v t e the state of israel is divided into six main administrative districts known as mehozot מחוזות singular mahoz center haifa jerusalem north southern and tel aviv districts as well as the judea and samaria area in the west bank all of the judea and samaria area and parts of the jerusalem and northern districts are not recognized internationally as part of israel districts are further divided into fifteen sub-districts known as nafot נפות singular nafa which are themselves partitioned into fifty natural regions 361 for statistical purposes the country is divided into three metropolitan areas tel aviv metropolitan area population 3,206,400 haifa metropolitan area population 1,021,000 and beer sheva metropolitan area population 559,700 362 israels largest municipality in population and area 363 is jerusalem with 773,800 residents in an area of 126 square kilometres  49sqmi in 2009 israeli government statistics on jerusalem include the population and area of east jerusalem which is widely recognized as part of the palestinian territories under israeli occupation 364 tel aviv haifa and rishon lezion rank as israels next most populous cities with populations of 393,900 265,600 and 227,600 respectively 363 israeli-occupied territories in 1967 as a result of the six-day war israel captured and occupied the west bank including east jerusalem the gaza strip and the golan heights israel also captured the sinai peninsula but returned it to egypt as part of the 1979 israelegypt peace treaty 365 between 1982 and 2000 israel occupied part of southern lebanon in what was known as the security zone since israels capture of these territories israeli settlements and military installations have been built within each of them israel has applied civilian law to the golan heights and east jerusalem and granted their inhabitants permanent residency status and the ability to apply for citizenship the west bank outside of the israeli settlements within the territory has remained under direct military rule and palestinians in this area cannot become israeli citizens israel withdrew its military forces and dismantled the israeli settlements in the gaza strip as part of its disengagement from gaza though it continues to maintain control of its airspace and waters the un security council has declared the annexation of the golan heights and east jerusalem to be null and void and continues to view the territories as occupied 366 367 the international court of justice principal judicial organ of the united nations asserted in its 2004 advisory opinion on the legality of the construction of the israeli west bank barrier that the lands captured by israel in the six-day war including east jerusalem are occupied territory 368 the status of east jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult issue in negotiations between israeli governments and representatives of the palestinians as israel views it as its sovereign territory as well as part of its capital most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of united nations security council resolution 242 which emphasises the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and calls on israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalization of relations with arab states a principle known as land for peace 369 370 371 the west bank was annexed by jordan in 1950 following the arab rejection of the un decision to create two states in palestine only britain recognized this annexation and jordan has since ceded its claim to the territory to the plo the west bank was occupied by israel in 1967 during the six-day war the population are mainly palestinians including refugees of the 1948 arab-israeli war 372 from their occupation in 1967 until 1993 the palestinians living in these territories were under israeli military administration since the israelplo letters of recognition most of the palestinian population and cities have been under the internal jurisdiction of the palestinian authority and only partial israeli military control although israel has on several occasions redeployed its troops and reinstated full military administration during periods of unrest in response to increasing attacks as part of the second intifada the israeli government started to construct the israeli west bank barrier 373 when completed approximately 13 of the barrier will be constructed on the green line or in israel with 87 inside the west bank 374 375 the gaza strip was occupied by egypt from 1948 to 1967 and then by israel after 1967 in 2005 as part of israels unilateral disengagement plan israel removed all of its settlers and forces from the territory israel does not consider the gaza strip to be occupied territory and declared it a foreign territory that view has been disputed by numerous international humanitarian organizations and various bodies of the united nations 376 377 378 379 380 following june 2007 when hamas assumed power in the gaza strip 381 israel tightened its control of the gaza crossings along its border as well as by sea and air and prevented persons from entering and exiting the area except for isolated cases it deemed humanitarian 381 gaza has a border with egypt and an agreement between israel the european union and the pa governed how border crossing would take place it was monitored by european observers 382 egypt adhered to this agreement under mubarak and prevented access to gaza until april 2011 when it announced it was opening its border with gaza foreign relations israel maintains diplomatic relations with 158 countries and has 107 diplomatic missions around the world 383 countries with whom they have no diplomatic relations include most muslim countries 384 only three members of the arab league have normalized relations with israel egypt and jordan signed peace
