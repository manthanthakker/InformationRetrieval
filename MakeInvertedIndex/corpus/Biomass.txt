biomass biofuel biomass geothermal hydropower solar energy tidal power wave power wind power topics by country 100 renewable energy marketing and policy trends v t e biomass is organic matter derived from living or recently living organisms biomass can be used as a source of energy and it most often refers to plants or plant-based materials that are not used for food or feed and are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass 1 as an energy source biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into thermal chemical and biochemical methods  contents 1 biomass sources 2 comparison of total plant biomass

biomass-derived energy since the time when people began burning wood to make fire 2 even today biomass is the only source of fuel for domestic use in many developing countries biomass is all biologically-produced matter based in carbon hydrogen and oxygen the estimated biomass production in the world is 104.9 petagrams  104.9  1015 g - about 105 billion metric tons of carbon per year about half in the ocean and half on land 3 wood remains the largest biomass energy source today 2 examples include forest residues such as dead trees branches and tree stumps yard clippings wood chips and even municipal solid waste wood energy is derived by using lignocellulosic biomass second-generation biofuels as fuel harvested wood may be used directly as a fuel or collected from wood waste streams to be processed into pellet fuel or other forms of fuels the largest source of energy from wood is pulping liquor or black liquor a waste product from processes of the pulp paper and paperboard industrycitation needed in the second sense biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals including biofuels industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants including miscanthus 4 switchgrass hemp corn poplar willow sorghum sugarcane bamboo 5 and a variety of tree species ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm palm oil based on the source of biomass biofuels are classified broadly into two major categories first-generation biofuels are derived from sources such as sugarcane and corn starch sugars present in this biomass are fermented to produce bioethanol an alcohol fuel which can be used directly in a fuel cell to produce electricity or serve as an additive to gasoline however utilizing food-based resources for fuel production only aggravates the food shortage problem 6 second-generation biofuels on the other hand utilize non-food-based biomass sources such as agriculture and municipal waste these biofuels mostly consist of lignocellulosic biomass which is not edible and is a low-value waste for many industries despite being the favored alternative economical production of second-generation biofuel is not yet achieved due to technological issues these issues arise mainly due to chemical inertness and structural rigidity of lignocellulosic biomass 7 8 9 plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy some examples of these plants are wheat which typically yields 7.5–8 tonnes of grain per hectare and straw which typically yields 3.5–5 tonnes per hectare in the uk 10 the grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first-generation biofuel the main contributors of waste energy are municipal solid waste manufacturing waste and landfill gas energy derived from biomass is projected to be the largest non-hydroelectric renewable resource of electricity in the us between 2000 and 2020 11 biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel rotting garbage and agricultural and human waste all release methane gas also called landfill gas or biogas crops such as corn and sugarcane can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel ethanol biodiesel another transportation fuel can be produced from leftover food products like vegetable oils and animal fats 12 several biodiesel companies simply collect used restaurant cooking oil and convert it into biodiesel 13 also biomass-to-liquids called btls and cellulosic ethanol are still under research 14 15 there is research involving algae or algae-derived biomass as this non-food resource can be produced at rates five to ten times those of other types of land-based agriculture such as corn and soy once harvested it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol butanol and methane as well as biodiesel and hydrogen efforts are being made to identify which species of algae are most suitable for energy production genetic engineering approaches could also be utilized to improve microalgae as a source of biofuel 16 the biomass used for electricity generation varies by region forest by-products such as wood residues are common in the us agricultural waste is common in mauritius sugar cane residue and southeast asia rice husks animal husbandry residues such as poultry litter are common in the uk 17 as of 2015update a new bioenergy sewage treatment process aimed at developing countries is under trial the omni processor is a self-sustaining process which uses sewerage solids as fuel in a process to convert waste water into drinking water with surplus electrical energy being generated for export 18 19 20 comparison of total plant biomass yields dry basisedit world resourcesedit if the total annual primary production of biomass is just over 100 billion  1.0e+11 tonnes of carbon yr 21 and the energy reserve per metric tonne of biomass is between about 1.5e3  3e3 kilowatt hours  5e6  10e6 btu 22 or 24.8 tw average then biomass could in principle provide 1.4 times the approximate annual 150e3 terrawatt hours required for current world energy consumption 23 for reference the total solar power on earth is 174 ktw the biomass equivalent to solar energy ratio is 143 ppm parts per million given current living system coverage on earth best in class solar cell efficiency is  20-40 additionally earths internal radioactive energy production largely the driver for volcanic activity continental drift etc is in the same range of power 20 tw at some 50 carbon mass content in biomass annual production this corresponds to about 6 of atmospheric carbon content in co2 for the current 400 ppm common commodity food

modified varietiesedit energy sorghum biomass conversionedit thermal conversionedit thermal conversion processes use heat as the dominant mechanism to convert biomass into another chemical form also known as thermal oil heating it is a type of indirect heating in which a liquid phase heat transfer medium is heated and circulated to one or more heat energy users within a closed loop system 31 the basic alternatives of combustion torrefaction pyrolysis and gasification are separated principally by the extent to which the chemical reactions involved are allowed to proceed mainly controlled by the availability of oxygen and conversion temperature energy created by burning biomass fuel wood is particularly suited for countries where the fuel wood grows more rapidly eg tropical countries there are a number of other less common more experimental or proprietary thermal processes that may offer benefits such as hydrothermal upgrading htu and hydroprocessing some have been developed for use on high moisture content biomass including aqueous slurries and allow them to be converted into more convenient forms some of the applications of thermal conversion are combined heat and power chp and co-firing in a typical dedicated biomass power plant efficiencies range from 20–27 higher heating value basis 32 biomass cofiring with coal by contrast typically occurs at efficiencies near those of the coal combustor  30–40 higher heating value basis 33 chemical conversionedit a range of chemical processes may be used to convert biomass into other forms such as to produce a fuel that is more conveniently used transported or stored or to exploit some property of the process itself many of these processes are based in large part on similar coal-based processes such as fischer-tropsch synthesis methanol production olefins ethylene and propylene and similar chemical or fuel feedstocks in most cases the first step involves gasification which step generally is the most expensive and involves the greatest technical risk 34 biomass is more difficult to feed into a pressure vessel than coal or any liquid therefore biomass gasification is frequently done at atmospheric pressure and causes combustion of biomass to produce a combustible gas consisting of carbon monoxide hydrogen and traces of methane this gas mixture called a producer gas can provide fuel for various vital processes such as internal combustion engines as well as substitute for furnace oil in direct heat applications 35 because any biomass material can undergo gasification this process is far more attractive than ethanol or biomass production where only particular biomass materials can be used to produce a fuel in addition biomass gasification is a desirable process due to the ease at which it can convert solid waste such as wastes available on a farm into producer gas which is a very usable fuel 35 conversion of biomass to biofuel can also be achieved via selective conversion of individual components of biomass 36 for example cellulose can be converted to intermediate platform chemical such a sorbitol 37 glucose 38 hydroxymethylfurfural 39 etc these chemical are then further reacted to produce hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuels 40 biomass also has the potential to be converted to multiple commodity chemicals halomethanes have successfully been by produced using a combination of a fermentans and engineered s cerevisiae 41 this method converts nax salts and unprocessed biomass such as switchgrass sugarcane corn stover or poplar into halomethanes s-adenosylmethionine which is naturally occurring in s cerevisiae allows a methyl group to be transferred production levels of 150mg l-1h-1 iodomethane were achieved at these levels roughly 173000l of capacity would need to be operated just to replace the united states need for iodomethane 41 however an advantage of this method is that it uses nai rather than i2 nai is significantly less hazardous than i2 this method may be applied to produce ethylene in the future other chemical processes such as converting straight and waste vegetable oils into biodiesel is transesterification 42 biochemical conversionedit as biomass is a natural material many highly efficient biochemical processes have developed in nature to break down the molecules of which biomass is composed and many of these biochemical conversion processes can be harnessed biochemical conversion makes use of the enzymes of bacteria and other microorganisms to break down biomass into gaseous or liquid fuels such a biogas or bioethanol 43 in most cases microorganisms are used to perform the conversion process anaerobic digestion fermentation and composting electrochemical conversionedit in addition to combustion biomassbiofuels can be directly converted to electrical energy via electrochemical oxidation of the material this can be performed directly in a direct carbon fuel cell 44 direct ethanol fuel cell or a microbial fuel cell 45 the fuel can also be consumed indirectly via a fuel cell system containing a reformer which converts the biomass into a mixture of co and h2 before it is consumed in the fuel cell 46 in the united statesedit the biomass power generating industry in the united states which consists of approximately 11,000 mw of summer operating capacity actively supplying power to the grid produces about 1.4 percent of the us electricity supply 47 currently the new hope power partnership is the largest biomass power plant in the us the 140 mw facility uses sugarcane fiber bagasse and recycled urban wood as fuel to generate enough power for its large milling and refining operations as well as to supply electricity for nearly 60,000 homes 48 49 second-generation biofuelsedit second-generation biofuels were not in 2010 produced commercially but a considerable number of research activities were taking place mainly in north america europe and also in some emerging countries these tend to use feedstock produced by rapidly reproducing enzymes or bacteria from various sources including excrement 50 grown in cell cultures or hydroponics 51 52 there is huge potential for second generation biofuels but non-edible feedstock resources are highly under-utilized 53 environmental impactedit using biomass as a fuel produces air pollution in the form of carbon monoxide carbon dioxide nox nitrogen oxides vocs volatile organic compounds particulates and other pollutants at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas in some cases such as with indoor heating and cooking 54 55 56 utilization of wood biomass as a fuel can also produce fewer particulate and other pollutants than open burning as seen in wildfires or direct heat applications 57 black carbon  a pollutant created by combustion of fossil fuels biofuels and biomass  is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming 58:56–57 in 2009 a swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in south asia determined that it had been principally produced by open burning of biomass and to a lesser extent by fossil-fuel burning 59 researchers measured a significant concentration of 14c which is associated with recent plant life rather than with fossil fuels 60 biomass power plant size is often driven by biomass availability in close proximity as transport costs of the bulky fuel play a key factor in the plants economics it has to be noted however that rail and especially shipping on waterways can reduce transport costs significantly which has led to a global biomass market 61 to make small plants of 1 mwel economically profitable those power plants need to be equipped with technology that is able to convert biomass to useful electricity with high efficiency such as orc technology a cycle similar to the water steam power process just with an organic working medium such small power plants can be found in europe 62 63 64 65 on combustion the carbon from biomass is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide co2 the amount of carbon stored in dry wood is approximately 50 by weight 66 however according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations plant matter used as a fuel can be replaced by planting for new growth when the biomass is from forests the time to recapture the carbon stored is generally longer and the carbon storage capacity of the forest may be reduced overall if destructive forestry techniques are employed 67 68 69 70 industry professionals claim that a range of issues can affect a plants ability to comply with emissions standards some of these challenges unique to biomass plants include inconsistent fuel supplies and age the type and amount of the fuel supply are completely reliant factors the fuel can be in the form of building debris or agricultural waste such as removal of invasive species or orchard trimmings furthermore many of the biomass plants are old use outdated technology and were not built to comply with todays stringent standards in fact many are based on technologies developed during the term of us president jimmy carter who created the united states department of energy in 1977 2 the us energy information administration projected that by 2017 biomass is expected to be about twice as expensive as natural gas slightly more expensive than nuclear power and much less expensive than solar panels 71 in another eia study released concerning the governments plan to implement a 25 renewable energy standard by 2025 the agency assumed that 598 million tons of biomass would be available accounting for 12 of the renewable energy in the plan 72 the adoption of biomass-based energy plants has been a slow but steady process between the years of 2002 and 2012 the production of these plants has increased 14 73 in the united states alternative electricity-production sources on the whole generate about 13 of power of this fraction biomass contributes approximately 11 of the alternative production 74 according to a study conducted in early 2012 of the 107 operating biomass plants in the united states 85 have been cited by federal or state regulators for the violation of clean air or water standards laws over the past 5 years this data also includes minor infractions 73 despite harvesting biomass crops may sequester carbon for example soil organic carbon has been observed to be greater in switchgrass stands than in cultivated cropland soil especially at depths below 12inches 75 the grass sequesters the carbon in its increased root biomass typically perennial crops sequester much more carbon than annual crops due to much greater non-harvested living biomass both living and dead built up over years and much less soil disruption in cultivation the proposal that biomass is carbon-neutral put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas when a trees carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades current studies indicate that even after 50 years the forest has not recovered to its initial carbon storage and the optimal strategy is likely to be protection of the standing forest 76not in citation given 77 78 the pros and cons of biomass usage regarding carbon emissions may be quantified with the iluc factor there is controversy surrounding the usage of the iluc factor 79 forest-based biomass has recently come under fire from a number of environmental organizations including greenpeace and the natural resources defense council for the harmful impacts it can have on forests and the climate greenpeace recently released a report entitled fuelling a biomess 80 which outlines their concerns around forest-based biomass because any part of the tree can be burned the harvesting of trees for energy production encourages whole-tree harvesting which removes more nutrients and soil cover than regular harvesting and can be harmful to the long-term health of the forest in some jurisdictions forest biomass removal is increasingly involving elements essential to functioning forest ecosystems including standing trees naturally disturbed forests and remains of traditional logging operations that were previously left in the forest environmental groups also cite recent scientific research which has found that it can take many decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be recaptured by regrowing trees and even longer in low productivity areas furthermore logging operations may disturb forest soils and cause them to release stored carboncitation needed in light of the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term in order to mitigate the effects of climate change a number of environmental groups are opposing the large-scale use of forest biomass in energy production 80 81 supply chain issuesedit with the seasonality of biomass supply and a great variability in sources supply chains play a key role in cost-effective delivery of bioenergy there are several potential challenges unique to bioenergy supply chains 82 technical issues inefficiencies of the conversion processes storage methods for seasonal availability complex multi-component constituents incompatible with maximizing efficiency of single purpose use high water content of many biomass feedstock conflicting decisions technologies locations and routes complex
