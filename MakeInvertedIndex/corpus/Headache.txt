headache headache is the symptom of pain anywhere in the region of the head or neck it occurs in migraines tension-type headaches and cluster headaches 1 frequent headaches can affect relationships and employment 1 there is also an increased risk of depression in those with severe headaches 1 headaches can occur as a result of many conditions whether serious or not there are a number of different classification systems for headaches the most well-recognized is that of the international headache society causes of headaches may include fatigue sleep deprivation stress the effects of medications the effects of recreational drugs viral infections common colds head injury rapid ingestion of a very cold food or beverage and dental or sinus issues treatment of a headache depends on the underlying cause but commonly involves pain medication some form of headache is one of the most commonly experienced of all physical discomforts about half of adults have a headache in a given year 1 tension headaches are the most common affecting about 1.6billion people  21.8 of the population followed by migraine headaches which affect about 848 million  11.7 2 contents 1 cause 1.1

life-threatening the description of the headache and findings on neurological examination determine whether additional tests are needed and what treatment is best 3 primary vs secondary headachesedit headaches are broadly classified as primary or secondary 4 primary headaches are benign recurrent headaches not caused by underlying disease or structural problems for example migraine is a type of primary headache while primary headaches may cause significant daily pain and disability they are not dangerous secondary headaches are caused by an underlying disease like an infection head injury vascular disorders brain bleed or tumors secondary headaches can be harmless or dangerous certain red flags or warning signs indicate a secondary headache may be dangerous 5 primary headachesedit 90 of all headaches are primary headaches primary headaches usually first start when people are between 20 and 40 years old  6 the most common types of primary headaches are migraines and tension-type headaches 6 they have different characteristics migraines typically present with pulsing head pain nausea photophobia sensitivity to light and phonophobia sensitivity to sound tension-type headaches usually present with non-pulsing bandlike pressure on both sides of the head not accompanied by other symptoms 7 other very rare types of primary headaches include 5 cluster headaches short episodes  15–180 minutes of severe pain usually around one eye with autonomic symptoms tearing red eye nasal congestion which occur at the same time every day cluster headaches can be treated with triptans and prevented with prednisone ergotamine or lithium trigeminal neuralgia shooting face pain hemicrania continua continuous unilateral pain with episodes of severe pain hemicrania continua can be relieved by the medication indomethacin primary stabbing headache recurrent episodes of stabbing ice pick pain or jabs and jolts for 1 second to several minutes without autonomic symptoms tearing red eye nasal congestion these headaches can be treated with indomethacin primary cough headache starts suddenly and lasts for several minutes after coughing sneezing or straining anything that may increase pressure in the head serious etiologiessee secondary headaches red flag section must be ruled out before a diagnosis of benign primary cough headache can be made primary exertional headache throbbing pulsatile pain which starts during or after exercising lasting for 5 minutes to 24 hours the mechanism behind these headaches is unclear possibly due to straining causing veins in the head to dilate causing pain these headaches can be prevented by not exercising too strenuously and can be treated with medications such as indomethacin primary sex headache dull bilateral headache that starts during sexual activity and becomes much worse during orgasm these headaches are thought to be due to lower pressure in the head during sex it is important to realize that headaches that begin during orgasm may be due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage so serious causes must be ruled out first these headaches are treated by advising the person to stop sex if they develop a headache medications such as propranolol and diltiazem can also be helpful hypnic headache moderate-severe headache that starts a few hours after falling asleep and lasts 15–30 minutes the headache may recur several times during night hypnic headaches are usually in older women they may be treated with lithium secondary headachesedit headaches may be caused by problems elsewhere in the head or neck some of these are not harmful such as cervicogenic headache pain arising from the neck muscles medication overuse headache may occur in those using excessive painkillers for headaches paradoxically causing worsening headaches 3 more serious causes of secondary headaches include 5 meningitis inflammation of the meninges which presents with fever and meningismus or stiff neck bleeding inside the brain intracranial hemorrhage subarachnoid hemorrhage acute severe headache stiff neck without fever ruptured aneurysm arteriovenous malformation intraparenchymal hemorrhage headache only brain tumor dull headache worse with exertion and change in position accompanied by nausea and vomiting often the person will have nausea and vomiting for weeks before the headache starts temporal arteritis inflammatory disease of arteries common in the elderly average age 70 with fever headache weight loss jaw claudication tender vessels by the temples polymyalgia rheumatica acute closed angle glaucoma increased pressure in the eyeball headache that starts with eye pain blurry vision associated with nausea and vomiting on physical exam the person will have a red eye and a fixed mid dilated pupil post-ictal headaches headaches that happen after a convulsion or other type of seizure as part of the period after the seizure the post-ictal state pathophysiologyedit the brain itself is not sensitive to pain because it lacks pain receptors however several areas of the head and neck do have pain receptors and can thus sense pain these include the extracranial arteries middle meningeal artery large veins venous sinuses cranial and spinal nerves head and neck muscles the meninges falx cerebri parts of the brainstem eyes ears teeth and lining of the mouth 8 9 pial arteries rather than pial veins are responsible for pain production 5 headaches often result from traction to or irritation of the meninges and blood vessels the nociceptors may be stimulated by head trauma or tumors and cause headaches blood vessel spasms dilated blood vessels inflammation or infection of meninges and muscular tension can also stimulate nociceptors and cause pain 9 once stimulated a nociceptor sends a message up the length of the nerve fiber to the nerve cells in the brain signaling that a part of the body hurts primary headaches are more difficult to understand than secondary headaches the exact mechanisms which cause migraines tension headaches and cluster headaches are not known there have been different theories over time which attempt to explain what happens in the brain to cause these headaches migraines are currently thought to be caused by dysfunction of the nerves in the brain 10 previously migraines were thought to be caused by a primary problem with the blood vessels in the brain 11 this vascular theory which was developed in the 20th century by wolff suggested that the aura in migraines is caused by constriction of intracranial vessels vessels inside the brain and the headache itself is caused by rebound dilation of extracranial vessels vessels just outside the brain dilation of these extracranial blood vessels activates the pain receptors in the surrounding nerves causing a headache the vascular theory is no longer accepted 10 12 studies have shown migraine head pain is not accompanied by extracranial vasodilation but rather only has some mild intracranial vasodilation 13 currently most specialists think migraines are due to a primary problem with the nerves in the brain 10 auras are thought to be caused by a wave of increased activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex a part of the brain known as cortical spreading depression 14 followed by a period of depressed activity 15 some people think headaches are caused by the activation of sensory nerves which release peptides such as serotonin causing inflammation in arteries dura and meninges and also cause some vasodilation triptans medications which treat migraines block serotonin receptors and constrict blood vessels 16 people who are more susceptible to experience migraines without headache are those who have a family history of migraines women and women who are experiencing hormonal changes or are taking birth control pills or are prescribed hormone replacement therapy 17 tension headaches are thought to be caused by activation of peripheral nerves in the head and neck muscles  18 cluster headaches involve overactivation of the trigeminal nerve and hypothalamus in the brain but the exact cause is unknown 19 diagnosisedit most headaches can be diagnosed by the clinical history alone 5 if the symptoms described by the person sound dangerous further testing with neuroimaging andor lumbar puncture may be necessary electroencephalography eeg is not useful for headache diagnosis 21 the first step to diagnosing a headache is to determine if the headache is old or new 22 a new headache can be a headache that has started recently or a chronic headache that has changed character 22 for example if a person has chronic weekly headaches with pressure on both sides of his head and then develops a sudden severe throbbing headache on one side of his head he has a new headache red flagsedit it can be challenging to differentiate between low-risk benign headaches and high-risk dangerous headaches since symptoms are often similar 23 headaches that are possibly dangerous require further lab tests and imaging to diagnose the american college for emergency physicians published criteria for low-risk headaches they are as follows 24 age younger than 30 years features typical of primary headache history of similar headache no abnormal findings on neurologic exam no concerning change in normal headache pattern no high-risk comorbid conditions for example hiv no new concerning history or physical examination findings a number of characteristics make it more likely that the headache is due to potentially dangerous secondary causes which may be life-threatening or cause long-term damage these red flag symptoms means that a headache warrants further investigation with neuroimaging and lab tests 6 in general people complaining of their first or worst headache warrant imaging and further workup 6 people with progressively worsening headache also warrant imaging as they may have a mass or a bleed that is gradually growing pressing on surrounding structures and causing worsening pain 23 people with neurological findings on exam such as weakness also need further workup 23 the american headache society recommends using ssnoop a mnemonic to remember the red flags for identifying a secondary headache 22 systemic symptoms fever or weight loss systemic disease hiv infection malignancy neurologic symptoms or signs onset sudden thunderclap headache onset after age 40 years previous headache history first worst or different headache other red flag symptoms include 6 22 23 25 old headachesedit old headaches are usually primary headaches and are not dangerous they are most often caused by migraines or tension headaches migraines are often unilateral pulsing headaches accompanied by nausea andor vomiting there may be an aura visual symptoms numbness or tingling 30–60 minutes before the headache warning the person of a headache migraines may also not have auras 25 tension type headaches usually have bilateral bandlike pressure on both sides of the head usually without nausea or vomiting however some symptoms from both headache groups may overlap it is important to distinguish between the two because the treatments are different 25 the mnemonic pound helps distinguish between migraines and tension type headaches pound stands for pulsatile quality 4–72 hours in length unilateral location nausea or vomiting disabling intensity 7 one review article found that if 4–5 of the pound characteristics are present migraine is 24 times as likely a diagnosis than tension type headache likelihood ratio 24 if 3 characteristics of pound are present migraine is 3 times more likely a diagnosis than tension type headache likelihood ratio 3 7 if only 2 pound characteristics are present tension type headaches are 60 more likely likelihood ratio 0.41 another study found the following factors independently each increase the chance of migraine over tension type headache nausea photophobia phonophobia exacerbation by physical activity unilateral throbbing quality chocolate as headache trigger cheese as headache trigger 26 cluster headaches are relatively rare  1–3 in 10,000 people and are more common in men than women they present with sudden onset explosive pain around one eye and are accompanied by autonomic symptoms tearing runny nose and red eye 5 temporomandibular jaw pain chronic pain in the jaw joint and cervicogenic headache headache caused by pain in muscles of the neck are also possible diagnoses 22 for chronic unexplained headaches keeping a headache diary can be useful for tracking symptoms and identifying triggers such as association with menstrual cycle exercise and food the national migraine center has free headache diaries to download at their website 27 while mobile electronic diaries for smartphones are becoming increasingly common a recent review found most are developed with a lack of evidence base and scientific expertise 28 new headachesedit new headaches are more likely to be dangerous secondary headaches they can however simply be the first presentation of a chronic headache syndrome like migraine or tension-type headaches one recommended diagnostic approach is as follows 29 if any urgent red flags are present such as visual loss new seizures new weakness new confusion further workup with imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture should be done see red flags section for more details if the headache is sudden onset thunderclap headache a computed tomography test to look for a brain bleed subarachnoid hemorrhage should be done if the ct scan does not show a bleed a lumbar puncture should be done to look for blood in the csf as the ct scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal if there are signs of infection such as fever rash or stiff neck a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered if there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness in an older person a temporal artery biopsy to look for temporal arteritis should be performed and immediate treatment should be started neuroimagingedit old headachesedit the us headache consortium has guidelines for neuroimaging of non-acute headaches 30 most old chronic headaches do not require neuroimaging if a person has the characteristic symptoms of a migraine neuroimaging is not needed as it is very unlikely the person has an intracranial abnormality 31 if the person has neurological findings such as weakness on exam neuroimaging may be considered new headachesedit all people who present with red flags indicating a dangerous secondary headache should receive neuroimaging 25 the best form of neuroimaging for these headaches is controversial 6 non-contrast computerized tomography ct scan is usually the first step in head imaging as it is readily available in emergency departments and hospitals and is cheaper than mri non-contrast ct is best for identifying an acute head bleed magnetic resonance imaging mri is best for brain tumors and problems in the posterior fossa or back of the brain 6 mri is more sensitive for identifying intracranial problems however it can pick up brain abnormalities that are not relevant to the persons headaches 6 the american college of radiology recommends the following imaging tests for different specific situations 32 lumbar punctureedit a lumbar puncture is a procedure in which cerebral spinal fluid is removed from the spine with a needle a lumbar puncture is necessary to look for infection or blood in the spinal fluid a lumbar puncture can also evaluate the pressure in the spinal column which can be useful for people with idiopathic intracranial hypertension usually young obese women who have increased intracranial pressure or other causes of increased intracranial pressure in most cases a ct scan should be done first 5 classificationedit headaches are most thoroughly classified by the international headache societys international classification of headache disorders ichd which published the second edition in 2004 33 the third edition of the international headache classification was published in 2013 in a beta version ahead of the final version 34 this classification is accepted by the who 35 other classification systems exist one of the first published attempts was in 1951 36 the us national institutes of health developed a classification system in 1962 37 ichd-2edit the international classification of headache disorders ichd is an in-depth hierarchical classification of headaches published by the international headache society it contains explicit operational diagnostic criteria for headache disorders the first version of the classification ichd-1 was published in 1988 the current revision ichd-2 was published in 2004 38 the classification uses numeric codes the top one-digit diagnostic level includes 14 headache groups the first four of these are classified as primary headaches groups 5-12 as secondary headaches cranial neuralgia central and primary facial pain and other headaches for the last two groups 39 the ichd-2 classification defines migraines tension-types headaches cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic headache as the main types of primary headaches 33 also according to the same classification stabbing headaches and headaches due to cough exertion and sexual activity sexual headache are classified as primary headaches the daily-persistent headaches along with the hypnic headache and thunderclap headaches are considered primary headaches as well secondary headaches are classified based on their etiology and not on their symptoms 33 according to the ichd-2 classification the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as whiplash injury intracranial hematoma post craniotomy or other head or neck injury headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage vascular malformations or arteritis are also defined as secondary headaches this type of headaches may also be caused by cerebral venous thrombosis or different intracranial vascular disorders other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure non-infectious inflammatory disease intracranial neoplasm epileptic seizure or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the central nervous system ichd-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well this type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or by exposure to some substances hivaids intracranial infections and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches the ichd-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders in the category of secondary headaches this means that headaches caused by dialysis high blood pressure hypothyroidism and cephalalgia and even fasting are considered secondary headaches secondary headaches according to the same classification system can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including teeth jaws or temporomandibular joint headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as somatization or psychotic disorders are also classified as secondary headaches the ichd-2 classification puts cranial neuralgias and other types of neuralgia in a different category according to this system there are 19 types of neuralgias and headaches due to different central causes of facial pain moreover the ichd-2 includes a category that contains all the headaches that cannot be classified although the ichd-2 is the most complete headache classification there is and it includes frequency in the diagnostic criteria of some types of headaches primarily primary headaches it does not specifically code frequency or severity which are left at the discretion of the examiner 33 nihedit the nih classification consists of brief definitions of a limited number of headaches 40 the nih system of classification is more succinct and only describes five categories of headaches in this case primary headaches are those that do not show organic or structural etiology according to this classification headaches can only be vascular myogenic cervicogenic traction and inflammatory managementedit primary headache syndromes have many different possible treatments in those with chronic headaches the long term use of opioids appears to result in greater harm than benefit 41 migrainesedit migraine can be somewhat improved by lifestyle changes but most people require medicines to control their symptoms 5 medications are either to prevent getting migraines or to reduce symptoms once a migraine starts preventive medications are generally recommended when people have more than four attacks of migraine per month headaches last longer than 12 hours or the headaches are very disabling 5 42 possible therapies include beta blockers antidepressants anticonvulsants and nsaids 42 the type of preventive medicine is usually chosen based on the other symptoms the person has for example if the person also has depression an antidepressant is a good choice abortive therapies for migraines may be oral if the migraine is mild to moderate or may require stronger medicine given intravenously or intramuscularly mild to moderate headaches should first be treated with nsaids like ibuprofen andor acetaminophen if accompanied by nausea or vomiting an antiemitic such as metoclopramide reglan can be given orally or rectally moderate to severe attacks should be treated first with an oral triptan a medication which mimics serotonin an agonist and causes mild vasoconstriction if accompanied by nausea and vomiting parenteral through a needle in the skin triptans and antiemetics can be given several complementary and alternative strategies can help with migraines the american academy of neurology guidelines for migraine treatment in 2000 stated relaxation training electromyographic feedback and cognitive behavioral therapy may be considered for migraine treatment along with medications 43 tension-type headachesedit tension-type headaches can usually be managed with nsaids ibuprofen naproxen acetaminophen or aspirin 5 triptans are not helpful in tension-type headaches unless the person also has migraines for chronic tension type headaches amitriptyline is the only medication proven to help 5 44 45 amitriptyline is a medication which treats depression and also independently treats pain it works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine and also reduces muscle tenderness by a separate mechanism 44 studies evaluating acupuncture for tension-type headaches have been mixed 46 47 48 49 50 overall they show that acupuncture is probably not helpful for tension-type headaches cluster headachesedit abortive therapy for cluster headaches includes subcutaneous sumatriptan injected under the skin and triptan nasal sprays high flow oxygen therapy also helps with relief 5 for people with extended periods of cluster headaches preventive therapy can be necessary verapamil is recommended as first line treatment lithium can also be useful for people with shorter bouts a short course of prednisone  10 days can be helpful ergotamine is useful if given 1–2 hours before an attack 5 see cluster headaches for more detailed information secondary headachesedit treatment of secondary headaches involves treating the underlying cause for example a person with meningitis will require antibiotics a person with a brain tumor may require surgery chemotherapy andor brain radiation neuromodulationedit peripheral neuromodulation has tentative benefits in primary headaches including cluster headaches and chronic migraine 51 how it may work is still being looked into 51 epidemiologyedit approximately 64–77 of people have a headache at some point in their lives during each year on average 46–53 of people have headaches 52 53 most of these headaches are not dangerous only approximately 1–5 of people who seek emergency treatment for headaches have a serious underlying cause 54 more than 90 of headaches are primary headaches 55 most of these primary headaches are tension headaches 53 most people with tension headaches have episodic tension headaches that come and go only 3.3 of adults have chronic tension headaches with headaches for more than 15 days in a month 53 approximately 12–18 of people in the world have migraines 53 more women than men experience migraines in europe and north america 5–9 of men experience migraines while 12–25 of women experience migraines 52 cluster headaches are very rare they affect only 1–3 per thousand people in the world cluster headaches affect approximately three times as many men as women 53 historyedit the first recorded classification system that resembles the modern ones was published by thomas willis in de cephalalgia in 1672 in 1787 christian baur generally divided headaches into idiopathic primary headaches and symptomatic secondary ones and defined 84 categories 40 another name for headache is cephalalgia which is a historic termcitation needed childrenedit in general children suffer from the same types of headaches as adults do but their symptoms may be slightly different the diagnostic approach to headache in children is similar to that of adults however young children may not be able to verbalize pain well 56 if a young child is fussy they may have a headache 57 approximately 1 of emergency department visits for children are for headache 58 59 most of these headaches are not dangerous the most common type of headache seen in pediatric emergency rooms is headache caused by a cold  28.5 other headaches diagnosed in the emergency department include post-traumatic headache  20 headache related to a problem with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt a device put into the brain to remove excess csf and reduce pressure in the brain  11.5 and migraine  8.5 59 60 the most common serious headaches found in children include brain bleeds subdural hematoma epidural hematoma brain abscesses meningitis and ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction only 4–6.9 of kids with a headache have a serious cause 57 just as in adults most headaches are benign but when head pain is accompanied with other symptoms such as speech problems muscle weakness and loss of vision a more serious underlying cause may exist hydrocephalus meningitis encephalitis abscess hemorrhage tumor blood clots or head trauma in these cases the headache evaluation may include ct scan or mri in order to look for possible structural disorders of the central nervous system 61 if a child with a recurrent headache has a normal physical exam neuroimaging is not recommended guidelines state children with abnormal neurologic exams confusion seizures and recent onset of worst headache of life change in headache type or anything suggesting neurologic problems should receive neuroimaging 57 when children complain of headaches many parents are concerned about a brain tumor generally headaches caused by brain masses are incapacitating and accompanied by vomiting 57 one study found characteristics associated with brain tumor in children are headache for greater than 6 months headache related to sleep vomiting confusion no visual symptoms no family history of migraine and abnormal neurologic exam 62 some measures can help prevent headaches in children drinking plenty of water throughout the day avoiding caffeine getting enough and regular sleep eating balanced meals at the proper times and reducing stress and excess of activities may prevent headaches 63 treatments for children are similar to those for adults however certain medications such as narcotics should not be given to children 57 children who have headaches will not necessarily have headaches as adults in one study of 100 children with headache eight years later 44 of those with tension headache and 28 of those with migraines were headache free 64 in another study of people with chronic daily headache 75 did not have chronic daily headaches two years later and 88 did not have chronic daily headaches eight years later 65 referencesedit lewis d w dorbad d  2000 the utility of neuroimaging in the evaluation of children with migraine or chronic daily headache who have normal
