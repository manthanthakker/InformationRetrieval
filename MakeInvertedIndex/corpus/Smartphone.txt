yearsedit devices that combined telephony and computing were first conceptualized by nikola tesla in 1909 and theodore paraskevakos in 1971 and patented in 1974 and were offered for sale beginning in 1993 paraskevakos was the first to introduce the concepts of intelligence data processing and visual display screens into telephones in 1971 while he was working with boeing in huntsville alabama paraskevakos demonstrated a transmitter and receiver that provided additional ways to communicate with remote equipment however it did not yet have general purpose pda applications in a wireless device typical of smartphones they were installed at peoples telephone company in leesburg alabama and were demonstrated to several telephone companies the original and historic working models are still in the possession of paraskevakos 9 forerunneredit the first mobile phone to incorporate pda features was an ibm prototype developed in 1992 and demonstrated that year at the comdex computer industry trade show it included pda features and other visionary mobile applications such as maps stock reports and news a refined version was marketed to consumers in 1994 by bellsouth under the name simon personal communicator the simon was the first commercially available device that could be properly referred to as a smartphone although it was not called that in 1994 11 12 13 in addition to placing and receiving cellular calls simon could send and receive faxes and emails and included an address book calendar appointment scheduler calculator world time clock and notepad utilizing its touch screen display 14 the term smart phone appeared in print as early as 1995 describing atts phonewriter communicator 15non-primary source needed pdasedit in the mid-late 1990s many mobile phone users carried a separate dedicated pda device running early versions of operating systems such as palm os blackberry os or windows cepocket pc 1 these operating systems would later evolve into mobile operating systems in march 1996 hewlett-packard released the omnigo 700lx a modified 200lx pda that supported a nokia 2110-compatible phone with rom-based software to support it it had a 640x200 resolution cga compatible 4-shade gray-scale lcd screen and could be used to place and receive calls and to create and receive text messages emails and faxes it was also 100 dos 5.0 compatible allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles including early versions of windows in august 1996 nokia released the nokia 9000 communicator a digital cellular phone based on the nokia 2110 with an integrated pda based on the geos v3.0 operating system from geoworks the two components were attached by a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design with the display above and a physical qwerty keyboard below the pda provided e-mail calendar address book calculator and notebook applications text-based web browsing and could send and receive faxes when closed the device could be used as a digital cellular phone in june 1999 qualcomm released the pdq smartphone a cdma digital pcs smartphone with an integrated palm pda and internet connectivity 16 subsequent landmark devices included the ericsson r380  2000 by ericsson mobile communications 17 the first device marketed as a smartphone 18 it combined the functions of a mobile phone and pda and supported limited web browsing with a resistive touchscreen utilizing a stylus 19 the kyocera 6035 early 2001 introduced by palm inc combining a pda with a mobile phone it operated on the verizon network and supported limited web browsing 20 21 handsprings treo 180  2002 the first smartphone to combine the palm os and a gsm phone with telephony sms messaging and internet access fully integrated into the os 22 smartphones before present-day android- ios- and blackberry-based phones typically used the symbian operating system originally developed by psion it was the worlds most widely used smartphone operating system until the last quarter of 2010citation needed mass adoptionedit in 1999 the japanese firm ntt docomo released the first smartphones to achieve mass adoption within a country these phones ran on i-mode which provided data transmission speeds up to 9.6 kbits 23 unlike future generations of wireless services ntt docomos i-mode used chtml a language which restricted some aspects of traditional html in favor of increasing data speed for the devices limited functionality small screens and limited bandwidth allowed for phones to use the slower data speeds available 24 the rise of i-mode helped ntt docomo accumulate an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001 it was also ranked first in market capitalization in japan and second globally this power would wane in the face of the rise of 3g and new phones with advanced wireless network capabilities 25 outside japan smartphones were still rare until the introduction of the danger hiptop in 2002 which saw moderate success in the us as the t-mobile sidekick later in the mid-2000s devices based on microsofts windows mobile started to gain popularity among business users in the us the blackberry later gained mass adoption in the us and american users popularized the term crackberry in 2006 due to its addictive nature 26 the company first released its gsm blackberry 6210 blackberry 6220 and blackberry 6230 devices in 2003 27 operating systemsedit symbian was the most popular smartphone os in europe during the middle to late 2000s initially nokias symbian devices were focused on business similar to windows mobile and blackberry devices at the time from 2006 onwards nokia started producing entertainment-focused smartphones popularized by the nseries in asia with the exception of japan the trend was similar to that of europecitation needed in 2003 motorola launched the first smartphone to use linux the a760 handset 28 while the initial release was limited to a single high-end handset only available in the asia-pacific region the makers intention was to eventually use linux on most of its handsets including the lower-end models further models to use linux such as the motorola ming a1200i in 2005 and several successors to the ming line would be unveiled through 2010 in late 2009 motorola released the motorola cliq 29 the first of motorolas smartphones to run the linux-based android operating system in early 2007 apple inc introduced the iphone one of the first smartphones to use a multi-touch interface the iphone was notable for its use of a large touchscreen for direct finger input as its main means of interaction instead of a stylus keyboard or keypad typical for smartphones at the time 30 in october 2008 the first phone to use android called the htc dream also known as the t-mobile g1 was released 31 32 android is an open-source platform founded by andy rubin and now owned by google 33 34 although androids adoption was relatively slow at first it started to gain widespread popularity in 2010 and in early 2012 dominated the smartphone market share worldwide which continues to this day 35 these new platforms led to the decline of earlier ones microsoft for instance started a new os from scratch called windows phone nokia abandoned symbian and partnered with microsoft to use windows phone on its smartphones windows phone then became the third-most-popular os palms webos was bought by hewlett-packard and later sold to lg electronics for use on lg smart tvs blackberry limited formerly known as research in motion also made a new platform based on qnx blackberry 10 the capacitive touchscreen also changed smartphone form factors before 2007 it was common for devices to have a physical numeric keypad or physical qwerty keyboard in either a candybar or sliding form factor however by 2010 there were no top-selling smartphones with physical keypads 2010s technological developmentsedit in 2013 the fairphone company launched its first socially ethical smartphone at the london design festival to address concerns regarding the sourcing of materials in the manufacturing 36 in late 2013 qsalpha commenced production of a smartphone designed entirely around security encryption and identity protection 37 in december 2013 the worlds first curved oled technology smartphones were introduced to the retail market with the sale of the samsung galaxy round and lg g flex models 38 samsung phones with more bends and folds in the screens were expected in 2014 39 in 2013 water and dustproofing have made their way into mainstream high end smartphones including sony xperia z sony xperia z3 and samsung galaxy s5 40 previously this feature was confined to special ruggedized phones designed for outdoor use in early 2014 smartphones were beginning to use quad hd  2k 2560x1440 on 5.5 screens with up to 534 ppi on devices such as the lg g3 which is a significant improvement over apples retina display quad hd is used in advanced televisions and computer monitors but with 110 ppi or less on such larger displays 41 in 2014 wi-fi networks were used a lot for smartphones as wi-fi became more prevalent and easier to connect to it was predicted that wi-fi phone services will start to take off 42 43 44 in 2014 lg introduced lasers on the lg g3 to help camera focus 45 in 2014 some smartphones had such good digital cameras that they could be categorized as high-end point-and-shoot cameras with large sensors up to 1 with 20 megapixels and 4k video some can store their pictures in proprietary raw image format but the android operating system 5.0 lollipop serves open source raw images 46 47 by 2015 smartphones were increasingly integrated with everyday uses for instance credit cards mobile payments and mobile banking were integrated into smartphone applications and software as a service saas platforms 48 additionally recent technological innovations are causing the role of traditional keys to be fused into the smartphones because a smartphone can act as a digital key and access badge for its users 49 in october 2015 microsoft announced windows continuum a feature that allows users to connect their devices to an external monitor via microsoft continuum display dock 50 hp adds a layer to the continuum with their hp workplace which enables user to run a win32 app by a virtualized server 51 the first modular smartphone available to the public was the fairphone 2 which was released in december 2015 unlike most smartphones users can remove and replace parts on this phone future possible developmentsedit foldable oled smartphones have been anticipated for years but have failed to materialize because of the relatively high failure rate when producing these screenscitation needed as well creating a battery that can be folded is another hurdle 52 mobile operating systemsedit androidedit android is a mobile operating system developed by google inc and backed by an industry consortium known as the open handset alliance it is an open source platform with optional proprietary components including a suite of flagship software for google services and the application and content storefront google play 55 android was officially introduced via the release of its inaugural device the htc dream t-mobile g1 on 20 october 2008 56 as an open source product android has also been the subject of third-party development development groups have used the android source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system such as cyanogenmod to add features to the os and provide newer versions of android to devices that no longer receive official updates from their vendor 57 58 59 forked versions of android have also been adopted by other vendors such as amazoncom who used its fire os on a range of tablets and the fire phone 60 61 as it is a non-proprietary platform that has shipped on devices covering a wide range of market segments android has seen significant adoption gartner research estimated that 325 million android smartphones were sold during the fourth quarter of 2015 leading all other platforms samsung electronics who produces android devices was also the top smartphone vendor across all platforms in the same period of time 62 iosedit ios formerly iphone os is a proprietary mobile operating system developed by apple inc primarily for its iphone product line the iphone was first unveiled in january 2007 the device introduced numerous design concepts that have been adopted by modern smartphone platforms such as the use of multi-touch gestures for navigation eschewing physical controls such as physical keyboards in favor of those rendered by the operating system itself on its touchscreen including the keyboard and the use of skeumorphismmaking features and controls within the user interface resemble real-world objects and concepts in order to improve their usability 63 64 in 2008 apple introduced the app store a centralized storefront for purchasing new software for iphone devices 65 66 ios can also integrate with apples desktop music program itunes to sync media to a personal computer 67 68 the dependency on a pc was removed with the introduction of icloud on later versions of ios which provides synchronization of user data via internet servers between multiple devices 69 the iphone lines early dominance was credited with reshaping the smartphone industry and helping make apple one of the worlds most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011 however the iphone and ios have generally been in second place in worldwide market share 62 70 71 windows phoneedit windows phone is a series of proprietary smartphone operating systems developed by microsoft its original release windows phone 7 was a revamped version of the previous windows ce-based windows mobile platform however it was incompatible with the legacy platform 72 windows phones user interface was designed to

hardware support and functionality and added expanded enterprise-oriented functionality such as storage encryption 76 77 78 windows 10 mobile was released in late-2015 it is no longer promoted under the windows phone brand as it is intended to provide greater consistency and integration with windows 10 for pc including cross-platform applications via universal windows platform and the ability to dock supported devices to use a desktop interface with keyboard and mouse support 79 80 81 the windows phone series has had poor adoption in comparison to its competitors lack of interest in the platform also led to a decrease in third-party applications and some vendors ended their support for windows phone altogether  62 82 83 the most prominent windows phone vendor was nokia who exclusively adopted windows phone as its smartphone platform in 2011 as part of a wider partnership with microsoft 84 nokias lumia series was the most popular line of windows phone devices

blackberry app world in april 2009 in february 2014 93 of mobile developers were targeting smartphones first for mobile app development 118 displayedit one of the main characteristics of smartphones is their screen it usually fills most of the phones front surface about 70 screen size usually defines the size of a smartphone many have an aspect ratio of 16:9 some are 4:3 or other ratios they are measured in diagonal inches starting from 2.45 inches 119 phones with screens larger than 5.2 inches are often called phablets smartphones with screens over 4.5 inches commonly are shifted while using a single hand since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface or used in place with both hands liquid-crystal displays are the most common others are ips led oled amoled and e ink displays in the 2010s braille screens which can be used by visually impaired people are being developed it is expected that braille screens will use some type of microfluidics technology 120 accessoriesedit as with cellphones a range of accessories are sold for smartphones including cases screen protectors power charging cables add-on batteries headphones combined headphone-microphones which allow a person to use the phone without holding it to the ear and bluetooth-enabled powered speakers that enable users to listen to music files stored on their smartphones cases range from relatively inexpensive rubber or soft plastic cases which provide moderate protection from bumps and good protection from scratches to more expensive heavy-duty cases that combine a rubber padding with a hard outer shell some cases have a book-like form with a cover that the user opens to use the device when the cover is closed it protects the screen some book-like cases have additional pockets for credit cards thus enabling people to use them as wallets accessories include products sold by the manufacturer of the smartphone and compatible products made by other manufacturers market shareedit usageedit in the

similar to those affecting other mobile telephones as well there are some issues which are unique to smartphones battery lifeedit compared to earlier non-smartphone mobile phones smartphone battery life has generally been poor due to the significant power requirements of their computer systems and color screens poor smartphone battery life has negatively affected customer satisfaction 138 139 140 there is also a trend towards using batteries that the user cannot replace 141 smartphone users have addressed the challenge of limited battery life by purchasing additional chargers for use outside the home at work and in cars and by buying portable external battery packs external battery packs include generic models which are connected to the smartphone with a cable and custom-made models which piggyback onto a smartphones case socialedit a 2012 university of southern california study found that unprotected adolescent sexual activity was more common among owners of smartphones 142 a study conducted by the rensselaer polytechnic institutes rpi lighting research center lrc concluded that smartphones or any backlit devices can seriously affect sleep cycles 143 some persons might become psychologically attached to cellphones resulting in anxiety when separated from the devices 144 a smombie a combination of smartphone and zombie is a walking person using a smartphone and not paying attention as they walk possibly risking an accident in the process an increasing social phenomenon 145 the issue of slow-moving smartphone users led to the temporary creation of a mobile lane for walking in chongqing china 146 the issue of distracted smartphone users led the city of augsburg germany to embed pedestrian traffic lights in the pavement 147 while drivingedit mobile phone use while driving including talking on the phone texting or operating other phone features is common but controversial it is widely considered dangerous due to distracted driving being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents in september 2010 the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa reported that 995 people were killed by drivers distracted by cell phones in march 2011 a us insurance company state farm insurance announced the results of a study which showed 19 of drivers surveyed accessed the internet on a smartphone while driving 148 many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving in egypt israel japan portugal and singapore both handheld and hands-free use of a mobile phone which uses a speakerphone is banned in other countries including the uk and france and in many us states only handheld phone use is banned while hands-free use is permitted a 2011 study reported that over 90 of college students surveyed text initiate reply or read while driving 149 the scientific literature on the dangers of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone or texting while driving is limited a simulation study at the university of utah found a sixfold increase in distraction-related accidents when texting 150 due to the increasing complexity of smartphones this has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices this is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage rather than those which ban handheld use only as officials cannot easily tell which function of the mobile phone is being used simply by looking at the driver this can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a phone call when in fact they were using the device legally for example when using the phones incorporated controls for car stereo gps or satnav a 2010 study reviewed the incidence of mobile phone use while cycling and its effects on behaviour and safety 151 in 2013 a national survey in the us reported the number of drivers who reported
