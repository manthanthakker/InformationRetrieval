and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer pedro álvares cabral who claimed the area for the portuguese empire brazil remained a portuguese colony until 1808 when the capital of the empire was transferred from lisbon to rio de janeiro

tree that once grew plentifully along the brazilian coast 24 in portuguese brazilwood is called pau-brasil with the word brasil commonly given the etymology red like an ember formed from latin brasa ember and the suffix -il from -iculum or -ilium 25 as brazilwood produces a deep red dye it was highly valued by the european cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from brazil 26 throughout the 16th century massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples mostly tupi along the brazilian coast who sold the timber to european traders mostly portuguese but also french in return for assorted european consumer goods 27 the official portuguese name of the land in original portuguese records was the land of the holy cross terra da santa cruz 28 but european sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the land of brazil terra do brasil on account of the brazilwood trade 29 the popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official portuguese name early sailors sometimes also called it the land of parrots terra di papaga 30 in the guarani language an official language of paraguay brazil is called pindorama this was the name the indigenous population gave to the region meaning land of the palm trees 31 history pre-cabraline era the earliest human remains found in the americas luzia woman were found in the area of pedro leopoldo minas gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years 32 33 the earliest pottery ever found in the western hemisphere was excavated in the amazon basin of brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago  6000 bc the pottery was found near santarém and provides evidence that the tropical forest region supported a complex prehistoric culture 34 around the time of the portuguese arrival the territory of current day brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people 35 mostly semi-nomadic who subsisted on hunting fishing gathering and migrant agriculture the indigenous population of brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups eg the tupis guaranis gês and arawaks the tupí people were subdivided into the tupiniquins and tupinambás and there were also many subdivision of the other groups 36 before the arrival of europeans the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture language and moral beliefs 37 these wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war 38 39 while heredity had some weight leadership status was more subdued over time than allocated in succession ceremonies and conventions 40 slavery among the indians had a different meaning than it had for europeans since it originated from a diverse socio-economic organization in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations 41 portuguese colonization the land now called brazil was claimed for the portuguese empire on 22 april 1500 with the arrival of the portuguese fleet commanded by pedro álvares cabral 42 the portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several tribes most of whom spoke languages of the tupiguarani family and fought among themselves 43 though the first settlement was founded in 1532 colonization was effectively begun in 1534 when king dom joãoiii of portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincy colonies of brazil 44 45 however the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic and in 1549 the portuguese king restructured them into the governorate general of brazil a single and centralized portuguese colony in south america 45 46 in the first two centuries of colonization indigenous and european groups lived in constant war establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other 47 48 49 50 by the mid-16th century cane sugar had become brazils most important exportation product 43 51 and slaves purchased in sub-saharan africa in the slave market of western africa 52 not only those from portuguese allies of their colonies in angola and mozambique had become its largest import 53 54 to cope with plantations of sugarcane due to increasing international demand for brazilian sugar 55 56 by the end of the 17th century sugarcane exports began to decline 57 and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colonys economy fostering a brazilian gold rush 58 which attracted thousands of new settlers to brazil from portugal and all portuguese colonies around the world 59 this increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers 60 portuguese expeditions known as bandeiras gradually advanced the portugal colonial original frontiers in south america to approximately the current brazilian borders 61 62 in this era other european powers tried to colonize parts of brazil in incursions that the portuguese had to fight notably the french in rio during the 1560s in maranhão during the 1610s and the dutch in bahia and pernambuco during the dutchportuguese war after the end of iberian union 63 the portuguese colonial administration in brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of portugals wealthiest and largest colony to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance such as the quilombo of palmares 64 and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence such as the minas conspiracy 65 united kingdom with portugal in late 1807 spanish and napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental portugal causing prince regent joão in the name of queen maria i to move the royal court from lisbon to brazil 66 there they established some of brazils first financial institutions such as its local stock exchanges 67 and its national bank additionally ending the portuguese monopoly on brazilian trade and opening brazil to other nations in 1809 in retaliation for being forced into exile the prince regent ordered the portuguese conquest of french guiana 68 with the end of the peninsular war in 1814 the courts of europe demanded that queen maria i and prince regent joão return to portugal deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient european monarchy to reside in a colony in 1815 in order to justify continuing to live in brazil where the royal court had thrived for the past six years the crown established the united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state 69 however such a ploy didnt last long since the leadership in portugal resentful with the new status of its larger colony continued to require the return of court to lisbon as postulated by the liberal revolution of 1820 as well as groups of brazilians impatient for practical and real changes still demanded independence and a republic as showed by the 1817 pernambucan revolt 69 in 1821 as a demand of revolutionaries who had taken the city of porto 70 d joão vi was unable to hold out any longer and departed for lisbon there he swore oath to the new constitution leaving his son prince pedro de alcântara as regent of the kingdom of brazil 71 independent empire tensions between portuguese and brazilians increased and the portuguese cortes guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 liberal revolution tried to re-establish brazil as a colony 72 the brazilians refused to yield and prince pedro decided to stand with them declaring the countrys independence from portugal on 7 september 1822 73 a month later prince pedro was declared the first emperor of brazil with the regnal title of dom pedroi resulting in the foundation of the empire of brazil 74 the brazilian war of independence which had already begun along this process spread through northern northeastern regions and in cisplatina province 75 with the last portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 march 1824 76 portugal officially recognized brazil on 29 august 1825 77 on 7 april 1831 worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissensions with both liberal and conservative sides of politics including an attempt of republican secession 78 as well as unreconciled with the way that absolutists in portugal had given to the succession of king john vi pedroi went to portugal to reclaim his daughters crown abdicating the brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir who thus became the empires second monarch with the regnal title of dom pedroii 79 as the new emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he became of age a regency was set up by the national assembly 80 in the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power during this period a series of localized rebellions took place as the cabanagem the malê revolt the balaiada the sabinada and the ragamuffin war which emerged from the dissatisfaction of the provinces with the central power coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar of a vast slaveholding and newly independent nation state 81 this period of internal political and social upheaval which included the praieira revolt was overcome only at the end of the 1840s years after the end of the regency which occurred with the premature coronation of pedro ii in 1841 82 during the last phase of the monarchy internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery the atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850 83 as a result of the british aberdeen act but only in may 1888 after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country was the institution formally abolished 84 the foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related issues with the countries of the southern cone with which brazil has borders long after the cisplatine war that resulted in independence for uruguay 85 brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of pedroii these were the platine war the uruguayan war and the devastating paraguayan war the largest war effort in brazilian history 86 87 on 15 november 1889 worn out by years of economic stagnation in attrition with the majority of army officers as well as with rural and financial elites for different reasons the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup 88 early republic the early republican government was little more than a military dictatorship with army dominating affairs both at rio de janeiro and in the states freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power 89 in 1894 following the unfoldings of two severe crises an economic along with a military one the republican civilians rose to power 90 91 92 little by little a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate the defeated opposition presidential candidate getúlio vargas supported by most of the military successfully led the brazilian revolution of 1930 93 94 vargas was supposed to assume power temporarily but instead closed the congress extinguished the constitution ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states governors with his own supporters 95 96 in the 1930s three major attempts to remove vargas and his supporters from power occurred the first was the failed constitutionalist revolution of 1932 the second was the anti-fascist brazilian uprising of 1935 led by communists and the fascist integralist movement attempted a coup in may 1938 97 98 99 the 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which the congress transferred more power to the executive the 1937 coup détat resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election installed vargas as a dictator and began the estado novo era noted for government brutality and censorship of the press 100 in foreign policy the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of the republican period 101 was followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the league of nations 102 after its involvement in world war i 103 104 in world war ii brazil remained neutral until august 1942 when the country entered on the allied side 105 106 after suffering retaliations undertaken by nazi germany and fascist italy due to the country having severed diplomatic relations with axis powers in the wake of the pan-american conference 107 with the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the nazi-fascist regimes in europe vargass position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup with democracy being reinstated by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years before 108 vargas committed suicide in august 1954 amid a political crisis after having returned to power by election in 1950 109 110 contemporary era several brief interim governments succeeded after vargass suicide 111 juscelino kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises 112 the economy and industrial sector grew remarkably 113 but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of brasília inaugurated in 1960 114 his successor was jânio quadros who resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office 115 his vice-president joão goulart assumed the presidency but aroused strong political opposition 116 and was deposed in april 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military regime 117 the new regime was intended to be transitory 118 but it gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the fifth institutional act in 1968 119 the oppression was not limited to only those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime but also reached institutional opponents artists journalists and other members of civil society 120 121 inside and outside the country through the infamous operation condor 122 123 despite its brutality like other totalitarian regimes in history due to an economic boom known as an economic miracle the regime reached its highest level of popularity in the early 1970s 124 slowly however the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas 125 plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure made an opening policy inevitable which from the regime side was led by generals geisel and golbery 126 with the enactment of the amnesty law in 1979 brazil began its slow return to democracy which would be completed during the 1980s 82 civilians returned to power in 1985 when josé sarney assumed the presidency becoming unpopular during his tenure due to his failure in controlling the economic crisis and hyperinflation inherited from the military regime 127 sarneys unsuccessful government allowed the election in 1989 of the almost unknown fernando collor who was subsequently impeached by the national congress in 1992 128 collor was succeeded by his vice-president itamar franco who appointed fernando henrique cardoso as minister of finance in 1994 cardoso produced a highly successful plano real 129 that after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation finally granted stability to the brazilian economy 130 131 leading cardoso to be elected that year and again in 1998 132 the peaceful transition of power from fernando henrique to his main opposition leader luiz inácio lula da silva elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006 was seen as a proof that brazil had finally succeeded in achieving a long-sought political stability 133 134 however sparked by indignation and frustrations accumulated over decades against corruption police brutality inefficiencies of political establishment and public service numerous peaceful protests erupted in brazil from the middle of first term of dilma rousseff who succeeded lula in 2010 135 136 enhanced by a political and economic crises with evidences of involvement of politicians from all main political parties in several bribery and tax evasion schemes 137 138 with large street protests for and against her 139 rousseff was impeached by the brazilian congress in 2016 5 140 geography brazil occupies a large area along the eastern coast of south america and includes much of the continents interior 141 sharing land borders with uruguay to the south argentina and paraguay to the southwest bolivia and peru to the west colombia to the northwest and venezuela guyana suriname and france french overseas region of french guiana to the north it shares a border with every south american country except ecuador and chile it also encompasses a number of oceanic archipelagos such as fernando de noronha rocas atoll saint peter and paul rocks and trindade and martim vaz 14 its size relief climate and natural resources make brazil geographically diverse 141 including its atlantic islands brazil lies between latitudes 6n and 34s and longitudes 28 and 74w brazil is the fifth largest country in the world and third largest in the americas with a total area of 8,515,767.049km2  3,287,956sqmi 142 including 55,455km2  21,411sqmi of water 14 it spans four time zones from utc−5 comprising the state of acre and the westernmost portion of amazonas to utc−4 in the western states to utc−3 in the eastern states the national time and utc−2 in the atlantic islands 143 brazil is the only country in the world that has the equator and the tropic of capricorn running through it it is also the only country to have contiguous territory both inside and outside the tropics brazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills mountains plains highlands and scrublands much of the terrain lies between 200 metres  660ft and 800 metres  2,600ft in elevation 144 the main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country 144 the northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad rolling terrain broken by low rounded hills 144 the southeastern section is more rugged with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to 1,200 metres  3,900ft 144 these ranges include the mantiqueira and espinhaço mountains and the serra do mar 144 in the north the guiana highlands form a major drainage divide separating rivers that flow south into the amazon basin from rivers that empty into the orinoco river system in venezuela to the north the highest point in brazil is the pico da neblina at 2,994 metres  9,823ft and the lowest is the atlantic ocean 14 brazil has a dense and complex system of rivers one of the worlds most extensive with eight major drainage basins all of which drain into the atlantic 145 major rivers include the amazon the worlds second-longest river and the largest in terms of volume of water the paraná and its major tributary the iguaçu which includes the iguazu falls the negro são francisco xingu madeira and tapajós rivers 145 climate the climate of brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography but most of the country is tropical 14 according to the köppen system brazil hosts five major climatic subtypes equatorial tropical semiarid highland tropical temperate and subtropical the different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast to temperate coniferous forests in the south and tropical savannas in central brazil 146 many regions have starkly different microclimates 147 148 an equatorial climate characterizes much of northern brazil there is no real dry season but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls 146 temperatures average 25c  77f 148 with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons 147 over central brazil rainfall is more seasonal characteristic of a savanna climate 147 this region is as extensive as the amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude 146 in the interior northeast seasonal rainfall is even more extreme the semiarid climatic region generally receives less than 800 millimetres  31.5in of rain 149 most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year 150 and occasionally less than this creating long periods of drought 147 brazils 1877–78 grande seca great drought the worst in brazils history 151 caused approximately half a million deaths 152 a similarly devastating drought occurred in 1915 153 south of bahia near the coasts and more southerly most of the state of são paulo the distribution of rainfall changes with rain falling throughout the year 146 the south enjoys subtropical conditions with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding 18c  64.4f 148 winter frosts and snowfall are not rare in the highest areas 146 147 biodiversity and environment brazils large territory comprises different ecosystems such as the amazon rainforest recognized as having the greatest biological diversity in the world 154 with the atlantic forest and the cerrado sustaining the greatest biodiversity 155 in the south the araucaria pine forest grows under temperate conditions 155 the rich wildlife of brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats scientists estimate that the total number of plant and animal species in brazil could approach four million mostly invertebrates 155 larger mammals include carnivores pumas jaguars ocelots rare bush dogs and foxes and herbivores peccaries tapirs anteaters sloths opossums and armadillos deer are plentiful in the south and many species of new world monkeys are found in the northern rain forests 155 156 concern for the environment has grown in response to global interest in environmental issues 157 brazils amazon basin is home to an extremely diverse array of fish species including the red-bellied piranha despite its reputation as a ferocious freshwater fish the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger biodiversity can contribute to agriculture livestock forestry and fisheries extraction however almost all economically exploited species of plants such as soybeans and coffee or animals such as chickens are imported from other countries and the economic use of native species still crawls in the brazilian gdp the forest sector represents just over 1 and fishing 0.4 the natural heritage of brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture logging mining resettlement oil and gas extraction over-fishing wildlife trade dams and infrastructure water pollution climate change fire and invasive species 154 in many areas of the country the natural environment is threatened by development 158 construction of highways has opened up previously remote areas for agriculture and settlement dams have flooded valleys and inundated wildlife habitats and mines have scarred and polluted the landscape 157 159 at least 70 dams are said to be planned for the amazon region including the controversial belo monte hydroelectric dam 160 government and politics the form of government is that of a democratic federative republic with a presidential system 16 the president is both head of state and head of government of the union and is elected for a four-year term 16 with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term the current president is michel temer who replaced dilma rousseff after her impeachment 161 the president appoints the ministers of state who assist in government 16 legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in brazil the national congress is the federations bicameral legislature consisting of the chamber of deputies and the federal senate judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively brazil is a democracy according to the democracy index 2010 162 the brazilian federation is the indissoluble union of the states the municipalities and the federal district 16 the union the states and the federal district and the municipalities are the spheres of government the federation is set on five fundamental principles 16 sovereignty citizenship dignity of human beings the social values of labour and freedom of enterprise and political pluralism the classic tripartite branches of government executive legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system are formally established by the constitution 16 the executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and statefederal district spheres all members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected 163 164 165 judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams 163 for most of its democratic history brazil has had a multi-party system proportional representation voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70 16 together with several smaller parties four political parties stand out workers party pt brazilian social democracy party psdb brazilian democratic movement party pmdb and democrats dem fifteen political parties are represented in congress it is common for politicians to switch parties and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly 166 almost all governmental and administrative functions are exercised by authorities and agencies affiliated to the executive law brazilian law is based on roman-germanicnot in citation given traditions 167 and civil law concepts prevail over common law practice most of brazilian law is codified although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part playing a complementary role court decisions set out interpretive guidelines however they are seldom binding on other specific cases doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases the legal system is based on the federal constitution which was promulgated on 5 october 1988 and is the fundamental law of brazil all other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules 168 as of april 2007update there have been 53 amendments states have their own constitutions which must not contradict the federal constitution 169 municipalities and the federal district have organic laws leis orgânicas which act in a similar way to constitutions 170 legislative entities are the main source of statutes although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms 16 jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities although in rare situations the federal constitution allows the federal senate to pass on legal judgments 16 there are also specialized military labor and electoral courts 16 the highest court is the supreme federal court this system has been criticized over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision-making lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve and in some cases more than a decade elapses before definitive rulings 171 nevertheless the supreme federal tribunal was the first court in the world to transmit its sessions on television and also via youtube 172 173 more recently in december 2009 the supreme court adopted twitter to display items on the day planner of the ministers to inform the daily actions of the court and the most important decisions made by them 174 military the armed forces of brazil are the second largest in latin america by active personnel and the largest in terms of military equipment 175 it consists of the brazilian army including the army aviation command the brazilian navy including the marine corps and naval aviation and the brazilian air force brazils conscription policy gives it one of the worlds largest military forces estimated at more than 1.6 million reservist annually 176 numbering close to 236,000 active personnel 177 the brazilian army has the largest number of armored vehicles in south america including armored transports and tanks 178 it is also unique in latin america for its large elite forces specializing in unconventional missions the brazilian special operations command 179 180 181 and the versatile strategic rapid action force made up of highly mobilized and prepared special operations brigade infantry brigade parachutist 182 183 1st jungle infantry battalion airmobile 184 and 12th brigade light infantry airmobile 185 to act anywhere in the country in short time the external aggression hypothesis 186 the states military police and the military firefighters corps are described as an ancillary forces of the army by the constitution but are under the control of each states governor 16 the navy once operated some of the most powerful warships in the world with the two minas geraes-class dreadnoughts which sparked a south american dreadnought race between argentina brazil and chile 187 today it is a green water force and has a group of specialized elite in retaking ships and naval facilities grumec unit specially trained to protect brazilian oil platforms along its coast 188 its the only navy in latin america that operates an aircraft carrier nae são paulo 189 and one of the ten navies of the world to operate this type of ship 178 the air force it is the largest in latin america has about 700 manned aircraft in service and effective about 67 thousand military 190 brazil has not been invaded since 1865 during the paraguayan war 191 additionally brazil has no contested territorial disputes with any of its neighbours 192 and neither does it have rivalries like chile and bolivia have with each other 193 194 the brazilian military has also three times intervened militarily to overthrow the brazilian government 195 it has built a tradition of participating in un peacekeeping missions such as in haiti and east timor 196 foreign policy brazils international relations are based on article 4 of the federal constitution which establishes non-intervention self-determination international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as the guiding principles of brazils relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations 197 according to the constitution the president has ultimate authority over foreign policy while the congress is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and international treaties as well as legislation relating to brazilian foreign policy 198 brazils foreign policy is a by-product of the countrys unique position as a regional power in latin america a leader among developing countries and an emerging world power 199 brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of multilateralism peaceful dispute settlement and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries 200 an increasingly well-developed tool of brazils foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries 201 brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels 201 total aid is estimated to be around $1 billion per year that includes 201 technical cooperation of around $480 million $30 million in 2010 provided directly by the brazilian cooperation agency abc an estimated $450 million for in-kind expertise provided by brazilian institutions specialising in technical cooperation in addition brazil manages a peacekeeping mission in haiti $350 million and makes in-kind contributions to the world

the brazilian south-south aid has been described as a global model in waiting 202 law enforcement and crime in brazil the constitution establishes five different police agencies for law enforcement federal police department federal highway police federal railroad police military police and civil police of these the first three are affiliated with federal authorities and the last two are subordinate to state governments all police forces are the responsibility of the executive branch of any of the federal or estadual powers 16 the national public security force also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country 203 the country still has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence and homicide in 2012 the world health organization who estimated the number of 32 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants one of the highest rates of intentional homicide of the world 204 the number considered tolerable by the who is about 10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants 205 however there are differences between the crime rates in the brazilian states while in são paulo the homicide rate registered in 2013 was 10.8 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in alagoas it was 64.7 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants 206 brazil also has high levels of incarceration and the third largest prison population in the world behind only china and the united states with an estimated total of approximately 700,000 prisoners around the country june 2014 an increase of about 300 compared to the index registered in 1992 207 the high number of prisoners eventually overloaded the brazilian prison system leading to a shortfall of about two hundred thousand accommodations 208 administrative divisions brazil is a federation composed of 26 states one federal district which contains the capital city brasília and municipalities 16 states have autonomous administrations collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the federal government they have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters they also have independent courts of law for common justice despite this states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in the united states for example criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral congress and are uniform throughout the country 16 the states and the federal district may be grouped into regions northern northeast central-west southeast and southern the brazilian regions are merely geographical not political or administrative divisions and they do not have any specific form of government although defined by law brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects municipalities as the states have autonomous administrations collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the union and state government 16 each has a mayor and an elected legislative body but no separate court of law indeed a court of law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called comarca

undergoing a currency crisis until definitively changing the exchange regime to free-float in january 1999 217 brazil received an international monetary fund rescue package in mid-2002 of $30.4billion 218 then a record sum brazils central bank paid back the imf loan in 2005 although it was not due to be repaid until 2006 219 one of the issues the central bank of brazil recently dealt with was an excess of speculative short-term capital inflows to the country which may have contributed to a fall in the value of the us dollar against the real during that period 220 nonetheless foreign direct investment fdi related to long-term less speculative investment in production is estimated to be $193.8billion for 2007 221 inflation monitoring and control currently plays a major part in the central

generation 232 the first car with an ethanol engine was produced in 1978 and the first airplane engine running on ethanol in 2005 233 recent oil discoveries in the pre-salt layer have opened the door for a large increase in oil production 234 the governmental agencies responsible for the energy policy are the ministry of mines and energy the national council for energy policy the national agency of petroleum natural gas and biofuels and the national agency of electricity 235 tourism tourism in brazil is a growing sector and key to the economy of several regions of the country the country had 5 million visitors in 2010 ranking in terms of international tourist arrivals as the second destination in south america and third in latin america after mexico and argentina revenues from international tourists reached us$6 billion in 2010 showing a recovery from the 2008–2009 economic crisis 236 historical records of 5.4 million visitors and us$6.8 billion in receipts were reached in 2011 237 238 natural areas are its most popular tourism product a combination of ecotourism with leisure and recreation mainly sun and beach and adventure travel as well as cultural tourism among the most popular destinations are the amazon rainforest beaches and dunes in the northeast region the pantanal in the center-west region beaches at rio de janeiro and santa catarina cultural tourism in minas gerais and business trips to são paulo city 239 in terms of the 2015 travel and tourism competitiveness index ttci which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries brazil ranked in the 28st place at the worlds level third in the americas after canada and united states 240 241 brazils main competitive advantages are its natural resources which ranked 1st on this criteria out of all countries considered and ranked 23rd for its cultural resources due to its many world heritage sites the ttci report notes brazils main weaknesses its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped ranked 116th with the quality of roads ranking in 105th place and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness ranked 114th due in part to high ticket taxes and airport charges as well as high prices and high taxation safety and security have improved significantly 75th in 2011 up from 128th in 2008 241 according to the world tourism organization wto international travel to brazil accelerated in 2000 particularly during 2004 and 2005 however in 2006 a slow-down took place and international arrivals had almost no growth in 2007–08 242 243 244 in spite of this trend revenues from international tourism continued to rise from usd 4 billion in 2005 to 5 billion in 2007 despite 330 000 fewer arrivals this favorable trend is the result of the strong devaluation of the us dollar against the brazilian real which began in 2004 but which makes brazil a more expensive international destination 245 this trend changed in 2009 when both visitors and revenues fell as a result of the great recession of 2008–09 246 by 2010 the industry had recovered and arrivals grew above 2006 levels to 5.2 million international visitors and receipts from these visitors reached usd 6 billion 236 in 2011 the historical record was reached with 5.4 million visitors and us$6.8 billion in receipts 237 238 despite continuing record-breaking international tourism revenues the number of brazilian tourists travelling overseas has been growing steadily since 2003 resulting in a net negative foreign exchange balance as more money is spent abroad by brazilians than comes in as receipts from international tourists visiting brazil tourism expenditures abroad grew from usd 5.8 billion in 2006 to usd 8.2 billion in 2007 a 42 increase representing a net deficit of usd 3.3 billion in 2007 as compared to usd 1.5 billion in 2006 a 125 increase from the previous year 247 this trend is caused by brazilians taking advantage of the stronger real to travel and making relatively cheaper expenditures abroad 247 brazilians traveling overseas in 2006 represented 4 of the countrys population 248 in 2005 tourism contributed with 3.2 of the countrys revenues from exports of goods and services and represented 7 of direct and indirect employment in the brazilian economy 249 in 2006 direct employment in the sector reached 1.9 million people 250 domestic tourism is a fundamental market segment for the industry as 51 million people traveled throughout the country in 2005 251 and direct revenues from brazilian tourists reached usd 22 billion 252 5.6 times more receipts than international tourists in 2005 in 2005 rio de janeiro foz do iguaçu são paulo florianópolis and salvador

significant resources to launch vehicles and manufacture of satellite 257 owner of relative technological sophistication the country develops submarines aircraft as well as being involved in space research having a vehicle launch center light and being the only country in the southern hemisphere the integrate team building international space station iss 258 the country is also a pioneer in the search for oil in deep water from where extracts 73 of its reserves uranium is enriched at the resende nuclear fuel factory mostly for research purposes as brazil obtains 88 from its electricity from hydroelectricity 259 and the countrys first nuclear submarine will be delivered in 2015 by france 260 brazil is one of the three countries in latin america 261 with an operational synchrotron laboratory a research facility on physics chemistry material science and life sciences and brazil is the only latin american country to have a semiconductor company with its own fabrication plant the ceitec 262 according to the global information technology report 2009-2010 of the world economic forum brazil is the 61 worlds largest developer of information technology 263 brazil also has a large number of outstanding scientific personalities among the most renowned brazilian inventors are priests bartolomeu de gusmão landell de moura and francisco joão de azevedo besides alberto santos-dumont 264 evaristo conrado engelberg 265 manuel dias de abreu 266 andreas pavel 267 e nélio josé nicolai 268 brazilian science is represented by the likes of césar lattes brazilian physicist pathfinder of pi meson 269 mário schenberg considered the greatest theoretical physicist of brazil 270 josé leite lopes only brazilian physicist holder of unesco science prize 271 artur ávila the first latin american winner of fields medal 272 and fritz müller pioneer in factual support the theory of evolution by charles darwin 273 transport brazilian roads are the primary carriers of freight and passenger traffic the road system totaled 1.98 million km  1.23 million mi in 2002 the total of paved roads increased from 35,496km  22,056mi  22,056mi in 1967 to 184,140km  114,419mi  114,425mi in 2002 275 the first investments in road infrastructure have given up in the 1920s the government of washington luis being pursued in the governments of getúlio vargas and eurico gaspar dutra 276 president juscelino kubitschek  1956–61 who designed and built the capital brasília was another supporter of highways kubitschek was responsible for the installation of major car manufacturers in the country volkswagen ford and general motors arrived in brazil during his rule and one of the points used to attract them was of course support for the construction of highways with the implementation of fiat in 1976 ending an automobile market closed loop from the end of the 1990s the country has received large foreign direct investments installing in its territory other major car manufacturers and utilities such as iveco renault peugeot citroen honda mitsubishi mercedes-benz bmw hyundai toyota among others 277 brazil is the seventh most important country in the auto industry 278 brazils railway system has been declining since 1945 when emphasis shifted to highway construction the total length of railway track was 30,875km  19,185mi in 2002 as compared with 31,848km  19,789mi in 1970 most of the railway system belonged to the federal railroad corporation rffsa which was privatized in 2007 279 the são paulo metro was the first underground transit system in brazil the other metro systems are in rio de janeiro porto alegre recife belo horizonte brasília teresina and fortaleza the country has an extensive rail network of 28,538 kilometres  17,733 miles in length the tenth largest network in the world 8 currently the brazilian government unlike the past seeks to encourage this mode of transport an example of this incentive is the project of the riosão paulo high-speed rail that will connect the two main cities of the country to carry passengers there are about 2,500 airports in brazil including landing fields the second largest number in the world after the united states 280 são paulo-guarulhos international airport near são paulo is the largest and busiest airport with nearly 20 million passengers annually while handling the vast majority of commercial traffic for the country 281 for freight transport waterways are of importance eg the industrial zones of manaus can be reached only by means of the solimões- amazonas waterway  3,250 kilometres  2,020 miles with 6 metres  20 feet minimum depth the country also has 50,000 kilometres  31,000 miles of waterways 8 coastal shipping links widely separated parts of the country bolivia and paraguay have been given free ports at santos of the 36 deep-water ports santos itajaí rio grande paranaguá rio de janeiro sepetiba vitória suape manaus and são francisco do sul are the most important 282 bulk carriers have to wait up to 18 days before being serviced container ships 36,3 hours on average 283 water supply and sanitation among the achievements in the water supply and sanitation sector is an increase in access to water piped on premises from 79 to 92 between 1990 and 2010 an increase in access to improved sanitation from 68 to 79 in the same period 284 a functioning national system to finance water and sanitation infrastructure a high level of cost recovery compared to most other developing countries as well as a number of notable technical and financial innovations such as condominial sewerage and an output-based subsidy for treated wastewater called prodes among the challenges is the still high number of poor brazilians living in urban slums favela and in rural areas without access to piped water or sanitation water scarcity in the northeast of brazil water pollution especially in the south-east of the country the low share of collected wastewater that is being treated  35 in 2000 and long-standing tensions between the federal state and municipal governments about their respective roles in the sector health the brazilian public health system the national health system sus is managed and provided by all levels of government 285 the public health services are universal and available to all citizens of the country for free nevertheless millions of affluent brazilians have private health care coverage 286 according to the brazilian government the most serious health problems are 287 childhood mortality about 2.51 of childhood mortality reaching 3.77 in the northeast region motherhood mortality about 73.1 deaths per 100,000 born children in 2002 mortality by non-transmissible illness 151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by heart and

federal district and municipalities must manage and organize their respective education systems each of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance which manages funds as well as the mechanisms and funding sources the constitution reserves 25 of the state budget and 18 of federal taxes and municipal taxes for education 289 according to the ibge in 2011 the literacy

pessoa and was formalized on 20 april 1923 with the creation of radio society of rio de janeiro 296 television in brazil began officially on 18 september 1950 with the founding of tv tupi by assis chateaubriand 297 since then television has grown in the country creating large public networks such as globo sbt record and bandeirantes today it is the most important factor in popular culture of brazilian society indicated by research showing that as much as 67 298 299 of the general population follow the same daily soap opera broadcast digital television using the sbtvd standard based on the japanese standard isdb-t was adopted 29 june 2006 and launched on 2 november 2007 300 in may 2010 brazil launched tv brasil internacional an international television station initially broadcasting to 49 countries 301 demographics the population of brazil as recorded by the 2008 pnad was approximately 190 million 302  22.31 inhabitants per square kilometre or 57.8sqmi with a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1 303 and 83.75 of the population defined as urban 304 the population is heavily concentrated in the southeastern  79.8 million inhabitants and northeastern  53.5 million inhabitants regions while the two most extensive regions the center-west and the north which together make up 64.12 of the brazilian territory have a total of only 29.1 million inhabitants the first census in brazil was carried out in 1872 and recorded a population of 9,930,478 305 from 1880 to 1930 4 million europeans arrived 306 brazils population increased significantly between 1940 and 1970 because of a decline in the mortality rate even though the birth rate underwent a slight decline in the 1940s the annual population growth rate was 2.4 rising to 3.0 in the 1950s and remaining at 2.9 in the 1960s as life expectancy rose from 44 to 54 years 307 and to 72.6 years in 2007 308 it has been steadily falling since the 1960s from 3.04 per year between 1950 and 1960 to 1.05 in 2008 and is expected to fall to a negative value of–0.29 by 2050 309 thus completing the demographic transition 310 in 2008 the illiteracy rate was 11.48 311 and among the youth ages 15–19 1.74 it was highest  20.30 in the northeast which had a large proportion of rural poor 312 illiteracy was high  24.18 among the rural population and lower  9.05 among the urban population 313 race and ethnicity according to the national research by household sample pnad of 2008 48.43 of the population about 92 million described themselves as white 43.80 about 83 million as pardo brown 6.84 about 13 million as black 0.58 about 1.1 million as asian and 0.28 about 536 thousand as amerindian officially called indígena indigenous while 0.07 about 130 thousand did not declare their race 314 in 2007 the national indian foundation

in brazil 316 317 318 since the arrival of the portuguese in 1500 considerable miscegenation between amerindians europeans and africans has taken place in all regions of the country with european ancestry being dominant nationwide according to the vast majority of all autosomal studies undertaken covering the entire population accounting for between 65 to 77 319 320 321 322 brazilian society is more markedly divided by social class lines although a high income disparity is found between race groups so racism and classism can be conflated socially significant closeness to one racial group is taken in account more in the basis of appearance phenotypes rather than ancestry to the extent that full siblings can pertain to different racial groups 323 socioeconomic factors are also significant because a minority of pardos are likely to start declaring themselves white or black if socially upward 324 skin color and facial features do not line quite well with ancestry usually afro-brazilians are evenly mixed and european ancestry is dominant in whites and pardos with a significant non-european contribution but the individual variation is great 322 325 326 327 the brown population officially called pardo in portuguese also colloquially moreno 328 329 is a broad category that includes caboclos assimilated amerindians in general and descendants of whites and natives mulatos descendants of primarily whites and afro-brazilians and cafuzos descendants of afro-brazilians and natives 328 329 330 331 332 people of considerable amerindian ancestry form the majority of the population in the northern northeastern and center-western regions 333 higher percents of blacks mulattoes and tri-racials can be found in the eastern coast of the northeastern region from bahia to paraíba 332 334 and also in northern maranhão 335 336 southern minas gerais 337 and in eastern rio de janeiro 332 337 from the 19th century brazil opened its borders to immigration about five million people from over 60 countries migrated to brazil between 1808 and 1972 most of them of portuguese italian spanish german ukrainian polish jewish russian chinese japanese and arab origin 338 339 religion religion in brazil formed from the meeting of the catholic church with the religious traditions of enslaved african peoples and indigenous peoples 340 this confluence of faiths during the portuguese colonization of brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of brazilian catholic church characterized by traditional portuguese festivities 341 and in some instances allan kardecs spiritism a religion which incorporates elements of spiritualism and christianity religious pluralism increased during the 20th century 342 and the protestant community has grown to include over 22 of the population 343 the most common protestant denominations are pentecostal and evangelical ones other protestant branches with a notable presence in the country include the baptists seventh-day adventists lutherans and the reformed tradition 344 roman catholicism is the countrys predominant faith brazil has the worlds largest catholic population 345 according to the 2000 demographic census the pnad survey does not inquire about religion 73.57 of the population followed roman catholicism 15.41 protestantism 1.33 kardecist spiritism 1.22 other christian denominations 0.31 afro-brazilian religions 0.13 buddhism 0.05 judaism 0.02 islam 0.01 amerindian religions 0.59 other religions undeclared or undetermined while 7.35 have no religion 346 however in the last ten years protestantism particularly pentecostalism and evangelicalism has spread in brazil while the proportion of catholics has dropped significantly 347 after protestantism individuals professing no religion are also a significant group exceeding 7 of the population as of the 2000 census the cities of boa vista salvador and porto velho have the greatest proportion of irreligious residents in brazil teresina fortaleza and florianópolis were the most roman catholic in the country 348 greater rio de janeiro not including the city proper is the most irreligious and least roman catholic brazilian periphery while greater porto alegre and greater fortaleza are on the opposite sides of the lists respectively 348 urbanization according to ibge brazilian institute of geography and statistics urban areas already concentrate 84.35 of the population while the southeast region remains the most populated one with over 80 million inhabitants 349 the largest metropolitan areas in brazil are são paulo rio de janeiro and belo horizonte all in the southeastern region with 19.5 11.5 and 5.1million inhabitants respectively 350 the majority of state capitals are the largest cities in their states except for vitória the capital of espírito santo and florianópolis the capital of santa catarina there are also non-capital metropolitan areas in the states of são paulo campinas santos and the paraíba valley minas gerais steel valley rio grande do sul sinos valley and santa catarina joinville and itajaí valley 351 v t e language the official language of brazil is portuguese 353 article 13 of the constitution of the federal republic of brazil which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers radio television and for business and administrative purposes the most famous exception to this is a strong sign language law that was passed by the national congress of brazil legally recognized in 2002 354 the law was regulated in 2005 355 the law mandates the use of the brazilian sign language more commonly known by its portuguese acronym libras in education and government services the language must be taught as a part of the education and speech and language pathology curricula libras teachers instructors and translators are recognized professionals schools and health services must provide access inclusion to deaf people 356 brazilian portuguese has had its own development mostly similar to 16th-century central and southern dialects of european portuguese 357 despite a very substantial number of portuguese colonial settlers and more recent immigrants coming from northern regions and in minor degree portuguese macaronesia with a few influences from the amerindian and african languages especially west african and bantu restricted to the vocabulary only 358 as a resultcitation needed the language is somewhat different mostly in phonology from the language of portugal and other portuguese-speaking countries the dialects of the other countries partly because of the more recent end of portuguese colonialism in these regions have a closer connection to contemporary european portuguese these differences are comparable to those between american and british english 358 brazil is the only portuguese-speaking nation in the americas making the language an important part of brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its spanish-speaking neighbors 359 in 1990 the community of portuguese language countries cplp which included representatives from all countries with portuguese as the official language reached an agreement on the reform of the portuguese orthography to unify the two standards then in use by brazil on one side and the remaining lusophone countries on the other this spelling reform went into effect in brazil on 1 january 2009 in portugal the reform was signed into law by the president on 21 july 2008 allowing for a 6-year adaptation period during which both orthographies will co-exist the remaining cplp countries are free to establish their own transition timetables 360 minority languages are spoken throughout the nation one hundred and eighty amerindian languages are spoken in remote areas and a significant number of other languages are spoken by immigrants and their descendants 358 in the municipality of são gabriel da cachoeira nheengatu a currently endangered south american creole language  or an anti-creole according to some linguists  with mostly indigenous brazilian languages lexicon and portuguese-based grammar that together with its southern relative língua geral paulista once was a major lingua franca in brazilcitation needed being replaced by portuguese only after governmental prohibition led by major political changesexcessive detail baniwa and tucano languages had been granted co-official status with portuguese 361 there are significant communities of german mostly the brazilian hunsrückisch a high german language dialect and italian mostly the talian a venetian dialect origins in the southern and southeastern regions whose ancestors native languages were carried along to brazil and which still alive there are influenced by the portuguese language 362 363 talian is officially a historic patrimony of rio grande do sul 364 and two german dialects possess co-official status in a few municipalities 365 learning at least one second language generally english or spanish is mandatory for all the 12 grades of the mandatory education system primary and secondary education there called ensino fundamental and ensino médio respectively brazil is the first country in south america to offer esperanto to secondary students 366 culture the core culture of brazil is derived from portuguese culture because of its strong colonial ties with the portuguese empire 367 among other influences the portuguese introduced the portuguese language roman catholicism and colonial architectural styles the culture was however also strongly influenced by african indigenous and non-portuguese european cultures and traditions 368 some aspects
