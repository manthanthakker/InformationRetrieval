sustainable consumption sustainable consumption sc shares a number of common features with and is closely linked to the terms sustainable production and sustainable development sustainable consumption as part of sustainable development is a prerequisite in the world-wide struggle against sustainability challenges such as climate change famines or environmental pollution sustainable development as well as sustainable consumption rely on certain premises such as wise use of resources and minimisation of waste and pollution use of renewable resources within their capacity for renewal fuller

consumption governance  the oslo definitionedit the definition proposed by the 1994 oslo symposium on sustainable consumption defines it as the use of services and related products which respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while minimizing the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of future generations 1 strong and weak sustainable consumptionedit in order to achieve sustainable consumption two developments have to take place it requires both an increase in the efficiency of consumption as well as a change in consumption patterns and reductions in consumption levels in industrialized countries the first prerequisite is not sufficient on its own and can be named weak sustainable consumption here technological improvements and eco-efficiency support a necessary reduction in resource consumption once this aim has been met the second prerequisite the change in patterns and reduction of levels of consumption is indispensable strong sustainable consumption approaches also pay attention to the social dimension of well-being and assess the need for changes based on a risk-averse perspective 2 in order to achieve what can be termed strong sustainable consumption changes in infrastructures as well as the choices customers have are required in the political arena weak sustainable consumption has been discussed whereas strong sustainable consumption is missing from all debates 3 taking into consideration those two approaches to sustainable consumption it is evident that individual consumers play a key role a huge problem is the existence of a so-called attitude-behaviour or values-action gap ie many consumers are well aware of the importance of their consumption choices and care about environmental issues however most of them do not translate their concerns into their consumption patterns as the purchase-decision making process is highly complicated and relies on eg social political and psychological factors young et al identified a lack of time for research high prices a lack of information and the cognitive effort needed as the main barriers when it comes to green consumption choices 4 institutionalising sustainable consumptionedit developments of global sustainable consumption governanceedit 1992 - at the united nations conference on environment and development unced the concept of sustainable consumption is established in chapter 4 of the agenda 21 5 1994 - sustainable

program on sustainable consumption and production scp in the plan of implementation at the world summit on sustainable development wssd in johannesburg 8 2003 - the marrakech process was developed by co-ordination of a series a of meetings and other multi-stakeholder processes by unep and undesa following the wssd 9 sustainable consumption initiativesedit the centre on sustainable consumption and production is one of the leading independent authorities that is exploring the dimensions of consumption and production another scientific network focusing on sustainable consumption research is the sustainable consumption research and action initiative scorai with more than 800 members from mostly academia but also the non-profit sector 10 in 2007 tesco the largest supermarket in the united kingdom established the sustainable consumption institute sci with a Â£25 million grant to the university of manchester sustainable consumption teachingedit a benchmark of teaching activities on the topic of sustainable consumption has been carried out by the scientific network sustainable consumption research and action initiative scorai in february 2016 11 the main results for the identified courses are as follows most of the courses are fairly recent some in early 2000 most established between 2012-2014 they are generally not mandatory and are designed for 2-3 hours per week over one semester granting 2-5 credits ects the courses are balanced in number between undergraduate and graduate courses with a small fraction focussing on teacher training and policyngo training most courses are small in class size  15-25 with some ranging between 60-100 students 22 courses have been identified with a consumerconsumption specific focus 11 with a social change focus 6 with a policy focus 4
