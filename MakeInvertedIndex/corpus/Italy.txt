repubblica italiana 7 8 9 10 is a unitary parliamentary republic in europenote 1 located in the heart of the mediterranean sea italy shares open land borders with france switzerland austria slovenia san marino and vatican city italy covers an area of 301,338km2  116,347sqmi and has a largely temperate seasonal climate or mediterranean climate due to its shape it is often referred to in italy as lo stivale the boot 11 12 with 61 million inhabitants it is the third most populous eu member state since classical times ancient phoenicians and greeks etruscans and celts have inhabited the south centre and north of the italian peninsula respectively with various italic peoples dispersed throughout italy alongside other ancient italian tribes and greek carthaginian and phoenician colonies the italic tribe known as the latins formed the roman kingdom which eventually spread throughout italy assimilating and conquering other nearby civilisations and forming the roman republic rome ultimately emerged as the dominant power conquering much of the ancient world and becoming the leading cultural political and religious centre of western civilisation the legacy of the roman empire is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of civilian law republican governments christianity and the latin script during the middle ages italy suffered sociopolitical collapse amid calamitous barbarian invasions but by the 11th century numerous rival city-states and maritime republics rose to great prosperity through shipping commerce and banking and even laid the groundwork for capitalism 13 these independent city-states and regional republics acting as europes main port of entry for asian and near eastern imported goods often enjoyed a greater degree of democracy in comparison to the monarchies and feudal states found throughout europe at the time though much of central italy remained under the control of the theocratic papal states while southern italy remained largely feudal partially as a result of a succession of byzantine arab norman spanish and bourbon conquests of the region 14 the renaissance began in italy and spread to the rest of europe bringing a renewed interest in humanism science exploration and art with the start of the modern era italian culture flourished at this time producing famous scholars artists and polymaths such as leonardo da vinci galileo michelangelo and machiavelli explorers from italy such as marco polo christopher columbus amerigo vespucci and giovanni da verrazzano discovered new routes to the far east and the new world helping to usher in the european age of discovery nevertheless italys importance as a hub of commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes from the new world as new world imports and trade routes became more influential in europe and bypassed the east asian and mediterranean trade routes that the italian city-states had dominated 14 15 16 furthermore the italian city-states constantly engaged one another in bloody warfare with this tension and violent rivalry culminating in the italian wars of the 15th and 16th centuries a series of wars and foreign invasions that left the italian states vulnerable to annexation by neighbouring european powers italy would remain politically fragmented and fall prey to conquest occupation and general foreign domination by european powers such as france spain and austria subsequently entering a long period of decline by the mid-19th century a rising movement in support of italian nationalism and italian independence from foreign control lead to a period of revolutionary political upheaval known as the risorgimento which sought to bring about a rebirth of italian cultural and economic prominence by liberating and consolidating the italian peninsula and insular italy into an independent and unified nation-state after various unsuccessful attempts the italian wars of independence the expedition of the thousand and the capture of rome resulted in the eventual unification of the country now a great power after centuries of foreign domination and political division 17 from the late 19th century to the early 20th century the new kingdom of italy rapidly industrialised especially in the so-called industrial triangle of milan turin and genoa in the north and soon acquired a small colonial empire 18 19 however the southern areas of the country remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation fuelling a large and influential diaspora despite being one of the main victors in world war i italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil leading the way to the rise of a fascist dictatorship in 1922 the subsequent participation in world war ii on the axis side ended in military defeat economic destruction and a civil war following the rise of the italian resistance movement in the years that followed italy abolished the italian monarchy reinstated democracy enjoyed a prolonged economic boom and despite periods of sociopolitical turmoil eg anni di piombo mani pulite second mafia war and maxi trial became one of the worlds most developed nations 5 20 21 22 italy has the third largest economy in the eurozone and eighth largest economy in the world it has a very high level of human development and enjoys the highest life expectancy in the eu 23 italy plays a prominent role in regional and global economic military cultural and diplomatic affairs and the country is both a regional power 24 25 and a great power 26 27 italy is a founding and leading member of the european union and the member of numerous international institutions including the un nato the oecd the osce the wto the g7g8 g20 the union for the mediterranean the council of europe

 the assumptions on the etymology of the name italia are very numerous and the corpus of the solutions proposed by historians and linguists is very wide 28 according to one of the more common explanations the term italia from latin italia 29 was borrowed through greek from the oscan víteliú meaning land of young cattle cf lat vitulus calf umb vitlo calf 30 the bull was a symbol of the southern italic tribes and was often depicted goring the roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free italy during the social war greek historian dionysius of halicarnassus states this account together with the legend that italy was named after italus 31 mentioned also by aristotle 32 and thucydides 33 the name italia originally applied only to a part of what is now southern italy  according to antiochus of syracuse the southern portion of the bruttium peninsula modern calabria province of reggio and part of the provinces of catanzaro and vibo valentia but by his time oenotria and italy had become synonymous and the name also applied to most of lucania as well the greeks gradually came to apply the name italia to a larger region but it was during the reign of emperor augustus end of the 1st century bc that the term was expanded to cover the entire peninsula until the alps 34 history prehistory and antiquity excavations throughout italy revealed a neanderthal presence dating back to the palaeolithic period some 200,000 years ago 36 modern humans arrived about 40,000 years ago the ancient peoples of pre-roman italy  such as the umbrians the latins from which the romans emerged volsci oscans samnites sabines the celts the ligures and many others  were indo-european peoples the main historic peoples of possible non-indo-european heritage include the etruscans the elymians and sicani in sicily and the prehistoric sardinians which includes the nuragic civilisation other ancient italian peoples of undetermined language families but of possible non-indo-european origins include the rhaetian people and cammuni known for their rock carvings between the 17th and the 11th centuries bc mycenaean greeks established contacts with italy 38 39 40 41 and in the 8th and 7th centuries bc greek colonies were established all along the coast of sicily and the southern part of the italian peninsula became known as magna graecia also the phoenicians established colonies on the coasts of sardinia and sicily rome a settlement around a ford on the river tiber conventionally founded in 753 bc grew over the course of centuries into a massive empire stretching from britain to the borders of persia and engulfing the whole mediterranean basin in which greek and roman and many other cultures merged into a unique civilisation the roman legacy has deeply influenced the western civilisation shaping most of the modern world 42 in a slow decline since the third century ad the empire split in two in 395 ad the western empire under the pressure of the barbarian invasions eventually dissolved in 476 ad when its last emperor was deposed by the germanic chief odoacer while the eastern half of the empire survived for another thousand years middle ages after the fall of the western roman empire italy was seized by the ostrogoths 43 followed in the 6th century by a brief reconquest under byzantine emperor justinian the invasion of another germanic tribe the lombards late in the same century reduced the byzantine presence to a rump realm the exarchate of ravenna and started the end of political unity of the peninsula for the next 1,300 years the lombard kingdom was subsequently absorbed into the frankish empire by charlemagne in the late 8th century the franks also helped the formation of the papal states in central italy until the 13th century italian politics was dominated by the relations between the holy roman emperors and the papacy with most of the italian city-states siding for the former ghibellines or for the latter guelphs from momentary convenience 44 it was during this chaotic era that italian towns saw the rise of a peculiar institution the medieval commune given the power vacuum caused by extreme territorial fragmentation and the struggle between the empire and the holy see local communities sought autonomous ways to maintain law and order 45 in 1176 a league of city-states the lombard league defeated the german emperor frederick barbarossa at the battle of legnano thus ensuring effective independence for most of northern and central italian cities in coastal and southern areas the maritime republics the most notable being venice genoa pisa and amalfi heavily involved in the crusades grew to eventually dominate the mediterranean and monopolise trade routes to the orient 46 in the south sicily had become an islamic emirate in the 9th century thriving until the italo-normans conquered it in the late 11th century together with most of the lombard and byzantine principalities of southern italy 47 through a complex series of events southern italy developed as a unified kingdom first under the house of hohenstaufen then under the capetian house of anjou and from the 15th century the house of aragon in sardinia the former byzantine provinces became independent states known as giudicati although some parts of the island were under genoese or pisan control until the aragonese conquered it in the 15th century the black death pandemic of 1348 left its mark on italy by killing perhaps one third of the population 48 49 however the recovery from the plague led to a resurgence of cities trade and economy which allowed the bloom of humanism and renaissance that later spread in europe early modern in the 14th and 15th centuries northern-central italy was divided into a number of warring city-states the rest of the peninsula being occupied by the larger papal states and the kingdom of sicily referred to here as naples though many of these city-states were often formally subordinate to foreign rulers as in the case of the duchy of milan which was officially a constituent state of the mainly germanic holy roman empire the city-states generally managed to maintain de facto independence from the foreign sovereigns that had seized italian lands following the collapse of the western roman empire the strongest among these city-states gradually absorbed the surrounding territories giving birth to the signorie regional states often led by merchant families which founded local dynasties war between the city-states was endemic and primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as condottieri bands of soldiers drawn from around europe especially germany and switzerland led largely by italian captains 50 decades of fighting eventually saw florence milan and venice emerged as the dominant players that agreed to the peace of lodi in 1454 which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries this peace would hold for the next forty years the renaissance a period of vigorous revival of the arts and culture originated in italy thanks to a number of factors as the great wealth accumulated by merchant cities the patronage of its dominant families like the medici of florence 51 52 and the migration of greek scholars and texts to italy following the conquest of constantinople at the hands of the ottoman turks 53 54 55 the italian renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the italian wars the ideas and ideals of the renaissance soon spread into northern europe france england and much of europe in the meantime the discovery of the americas the new routes to asia discovered by the portuguese and the rise of the ottoman empire all factors which eroded the traditional italian dominance in trade with the east caused a long economic decline in the peninsula following the italian wars  1494 to 1559 ignited by the rivalry between france and spain the city-states gradually lost their independence and came under foreign domination first under spain  1559 to 1713 and then austria  1713 to 1796 in 1629–1631 a new outburst of plague claimed about 14 of italys population 56 in addition as the spanish empire started to decline in the 17th century so did its possessions in naples sicily sardinia and milan in particular southern italy was impoverished and cut off from the mainstream of events in europe 57 in the 18th century as a result of the war of spanish succession austria replaced spain as the dominant foreign power while the house of savoy emerged as a regional power expanding to piedmont and sardinia in the same century the two-century long decline was interrupted by the economic and state reforms pursued in several states by the ruling élites 58 during the napoleonic wars northern-central italy was invaded and reorganised as a new kingdom of italy a client state of the french empire 59 while the southern half of the peninsula was administered by joachim murat napoleons brother-in-law who was crowned as king of naples the 1814 congress of vienna restored the situation of the late 18th century but the ideals of the french revolution could not be eradicated and soon re-surfaced during the political upheavals that characterised the first part of the 19th century italian unification the birth of the kingdom of italy was the result of efforts by italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the house of savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire italian peninsula in the context of the 1848 liberal revolutions that swept through europe an unsuccessful war was declared on austria the kingdom of sardinia again attacked the austrian empire in the second italian war of independence of 1859 with the aid of france resulting in liberating lombardy in 1860–61 general giuseppe garibaldi led the drive for unification in naples and sicily 60 allowing the sardinian government led by the count of cavour to declare a united italian kingdom on 17 march 1861 in 1866 victor emmanuel ii allied with prussia during the austro-prussian war waging the third italian war of independence which allowed italy to annex venetia finally as france during the disastrous franco-prussian war of 1870 abandoned its garrisons in rome the italians rushed to fill the power gap by taking over the papal states the constitutionl law of the kingdom of sardinia the albertine statute of 1848 was extended to the whole kingdom of italy in 1861 and provided for basic freedoms of the new state but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting the government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces in 1913 male universal suffrage was adopted as northern italy quickly industrialised the south and rural areas of north remained underdeveloped and overpopulated forcing millions of people to migrate abroad while the italian socialist party constantly increased in strength challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment starting from the last two decades of the 19th century italy developed into a colonial power by forcing somalia eritrea and later libya and the dodecanese under its rule 61 italy nominally allied with the german empire and the empire of austria-hungary in the triple alliance in 1915 joined the allies into the war with a promise of substantial territorial gains that included western inner carniola former austrian littoral dalmatia as well as parts of the ottoman empire the war was initially inconclusive as the italian army get struck in a long attrition war in the alps making little progress and suffering very heavy losses eventually in october 1918 the italians launched a massive offensive culminating in the victory of vittorio veneto the italian victory 62 63 64 marked the end of the war on the italian front secured the dissolution of the austro-hungarian empire and was chiefly instrumental in ending the first world war less than two weeks later during the war more than 650,000 italian soldiers and as many civilians died 65 and the kingdom went to the brink of bankruptcy under the peace treaties of saint-germain rapallo and rome italy obtained most of the promised territories but not dalmatia except zara allowing nationalists to define the victory as mutilated moreover italy annexed the hungarian harbour of fiume that was not part of territories promised at london but had been occupied after the end of the war by gabriele dannunzio fascist regime the socialist agitations that followed the devastation of the great war inspired by the russian revolution led to counter-revolution and repression throughout italy the liberal establishment fearing a soviet-style revolution started to endorse the small national fascist party led by benito mussolini in october 1922 the blackshirts of the national fascist party attempted a coup the march on rome which failed but at the last minute king victor emmanuel iii refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed mussolini prime minister over the next few years mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties thus forming a dictatorship these actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as nazi germany and francoist spain in 1935 mussolini invaded ethiopia resulting in an international alienation and leading to italys withdrawal from the league of nations italy allied with nazi germany and the empire of japan and strongly supported francisco franco in the spanish civil war in 1939 italy annexed albania a de facto protectorate for decades italy entered world war ii on 10 june 1940 after initially advancing in british somaliland and egypt the italians were defeated in east africa greece russia and north africa after the attack on yugoslavia by germany and italy suppression of the yugoslav partisans resistance and attempts to italianisation resulted in the italian war crimes 66 and deportation of about 25,000 people to the italian concentration camps such as rab gonars monigo renicci di anghiari and elsewhere after the war due to the cold war a long period of censorship disinterest and denial occurred about the italian war crimes and the yugoslavs foibe killings 67 68 69 70 meanwhile about 250,000 italians and anti-communist slavs fled to italy in the istrian exodus an allied invasion of sicily began in july 1943 leading to the collapse of the fascist regime and the fall of mussolini on 25 july on 8 september italy surrendered the germans shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central italy the country remained a battlefield for the rest of the war as the allies were slowly moving up from the south in the north the germans set up the italian social republic rsi a nazi puppet state with mussolini installed as leader the post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement the resistenza hostilities ended on 29 april 1945 when the german forces in italy surrendered nearly half a million italians including civilians died in the conflict 71 and the italian economy had been all but destroyed per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since the beginning of the 20th century 72 republican italy italy became a republic after a referendum 73 held on 2 june 1946 a day celebrated since as republic day this was also the first time that italian women were entitled to vote 74 victor emmanuel iiis son umberto ii was forced to abdicate and exiled the republican constitution was approved on 1 january 1948 under the treaty of peace with italy of 1947 most of julian march was lost to yugoslavia and later the free territory of trieste was divided between the two states italy also lost all its colonial possessions formally ending the italian empire fears in the italian electorate of a possible communist takeover proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on 18 april 1948 when the christian democrats under the leadership of alcide de gasperi obtained a landslide victory consequently in 1949 italy became a member of nato the marshall plan helped to revive the italian economy which until the late 1960s enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth commonly called the economic miracle in 1957 italy was a founding member of the european economic community eec which became the european union eu in 1993 from the late 1960s until the early 1980s the country experienced the years of lead a period characterised by economic crisis especially after the 1973 oil crisis widespread social conflicts and terrorist massacres carried out by opposing extremist groups with the alleged involvement of us and soviet intelligence 75 76 77 the years of lead culminated in the assassination of the christian democrat leader aldo moro in 1978 and the bologna railway station massacre in 1980 where 85 people died in the 1980s for the first time since 1945 two governments were led by non-christian-democrat premiers one liberal giovanni spadolini and one socialist bettino craxi the christian democrats remained however the main government party during craxis government the economy recovered and italy became the worlds fifth largest industrial nation gaining entry into the g7 group however as a result of his spending policies the italian national debt skyrocketed during the craxi era soon passing 100 of the gdp in the early 1990s italy faced significant challenges as voters  disenchanted with political paralysis massive public debt and the extensive corruption system known as tangentopoli uncovered by the clean hands investigation  demanded radical reforms the scandals involved all major parties but especially those in the government coalition the christian democrats who ruled for almost 50 years underwent a severe crisis and eventually disbanded splitting up into several factions 78 the communists reorganised as a social-democratic force during the 1990s and the 2000s decade centre-right dominated by media magnate silvio berlusconi and centre-left coalitions led by university professor romano prodi alternatively governed the country in the late 2000s italy was severely hit by the great recession from 2008 to 2015 the country suffered 42 months of gdp recession the economic crisis was one of the main problems that forced berlusconi to resign in 2011 the government of the conservative prime minister was replaced by the technocratic cabinet of mario monti following the 2013 general election the vice-secretary of the democratic party enrico letta formed a new government at the head of a right-left grand coalition in 2014 challenged by the new secretary of the pd matteo renzi letta resigned and was replaced by renzi the new government started important constitutional reforms such as the abolition of the senate and a new electoral law geography italy is located in southern europe between latitudes 35 and 47 n and longitudes 6 and 19 e to the north italy borders france switzerland austria and slovenia and is roughly delimited by the alpine watershed enclosing the po valley and the venetian plain to the south it consists of the entirety of the italian peninsula and the two mediterranean islands of sicily and sardinia in addition to many smaller islands the sovereign states of san marino and the vatican city are enclaves within italy while campione ditalia is an italian exclave in switzerland the countrys total area is 301,230 square kilometres  116,306sqmi of which 294,020km2  113,522sqmi is land and 7,210km2  2,784sqmi is water including the islands italy has a coastline and border of 7,600 kilometres  4,722 miles on the adriatic ionian tyrrhenian seas  740km  460mi and borders shared with france  488km  303mi austria  430km  267mi slovenia  232km  144mi and switzerland  740km  460mi san marino  39km  24mi and vatican city  3.2km  2.0mi both enclaves account for the remainder the apennine mountains form the peninsulas backbone and the alps form most of its northern boundary where italys highest point is located on monte bianco  4,810m/15,782ftnote 2 the po italys longest river  652km/405mi flows from the alps on the western border with france and crosses the padan plain on its way to the adriatic sea the five largest lakes are in order of diminishing size 79 garda  367.94km2 or 142sqmi maggiore  212.51km2 or 82sqmi shared with switzerland como  145.9km2 or 56sqmi trasimeno  124.29km2 or 48sqmi and bolsena  113.55km2 or 44sqmi the country is situated at the meeting point of the eurasian plate and the african plate leading to considerable seismic and volcanic activity there are 14 volcanoes in italy four of which are active etna the traditional site of vulcans smithy stromboli vulcano and vesuvius vesuvius is the only active volcano in mainland europe and is most famous for the destruction of pompeii and herculanum several islands and hills have been created by volcanic activity and there is still a large active caldera the campi flegrei north-west of naples although the country comprises the italian peninsula and most of the southern alpine basin some of italys territory extends beyond the alpine basin and some islands are located outside the eurasian continental shelf these territories are the comuni of livigno sexten innichen toblach in part chiusaforte tarvisio graun im vinschgau in part which are all part of the danubes drainage basin while the val di lei constitutes part of the rhines basin and the islands of lampedusa and lampione are on the african continental shelf environment after its quick industrial growth italy took a long time to confront its environmental problems after several improvements it now ranks 84th in the world for ecological sustainability 80 national parks cover about 5 of the country 81 in the last decade italy has become one of the worlds leading producers of renewable energy ranking as the worlds fourth largest holder of installed solar energy capacity 82 83 and the sixth largest holder of wind power capacity in 2010 84 renewable energies now make up about 12 of the total primary and final energy consumption in italy with a future target share set at 17 for the year 2020 85 however air pollution remains a severe problem especially in the industrialised north reaching the tenth highest level worldwide of industrial carbon dioxide emissions in the 1990s 86 italy is the twelfth largest carbon dioxide producer 87 88 extensive traffic and congestion in the largest metropolitan areas continue to cause severe environmental and health issues even if smog levels have decreased dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s and the presence of smog is becoming an increasingly rarer phenomenon and levels of sulphur dioxide are decreasing 89 many watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity while because of rising water levels venice has been regularly flooded throughout recent years waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects on inhabitants of affected areas as in the case of the seveso disaster the country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990 but after the chernobyl disaster and a referendum on the issue the nuclear programme was terminated a decision that was overturned by the government in 2008 planning to build up to four nuclear power plants with french technology this was in turn struck down by a referendum following the fukushima nuclear accident 90 deforestation illegal building developments and poor land-management policies have led to significant erosion all over italys mountainous regions leading to major ecological disasters like the 1963 vajont dam flood the 1998 sarno 91 and 2009 messina mudslides climate thanks to the great longitudinal extension of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous internal conformation the climate of italy is highly diverse in most of the inland northern and central regions the climate ranges from humid subtropical to humid continental and oceanic in particular the climate of the po valley geographical region is mostly continental with harsh winters and hot summers 92 93 the coastal areas of liguria tuscany and most of the south generally fit the mediterranean climate stereotype köppen climate classification csa conditions on peninsular coastal areas can be very different from the interiors higher ground and valleys particularly during the winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold wet and often snowy the coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer average winter temperatures vary from 0c  32f on the alps to 12c  54f in sicily like so the average summer temperatures range from 20c  68f to over 25c  77f 94 politics italy has been a unitary parliamentary republic since 2 june 1946 when the monarchy was abolished by a constitutional referendum the president of italy presidente della repubblica currently sergio mattarella since 2015 is italys head of state the president is elected for a single seven years mandate by the parliament of italy in joint session italy has a written democratic constitution resulting from the work of a constituent assembly formed by the representatives of all the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of nazi and fascist forces during the civil war 95 government italy has a parliamentary government based on a proportional voting system the parliament is perfectly bicameral the two houses the chamber of deputies that meets in palazzo montecitorio and the senate of the republic that meets in palazzo madama have the same powers the prime minister officially president of the council of ministers presidente del consiglio dei ministri is italys head of government the prime minister and the cabinet are appointed by the president of the republic but must pass a vote of confidence in parliament to come into office the incumbent prime minister is matteo renzi of the democratic party the prime minister is the president of the council of ministerswhich holds effective executive power and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities the office is similar to those in most other parliamentary systems but the leader of the italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the parliament of italy another difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the president of the council of ministers by virtue of that the prime minister has exclusive power to coordinate intelligence policies determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security apply and protect state secrets authorise agents to carry out operations in italy or abroad in violation of the law 96 a peculiarity of the italian parliament is the representation given to italian citizens permanently living abroad 12 deputies and 6 senators elected in four distinct overseas constituencies in addition the italian senate is characterised also by a small number of senators for life appointed by the president for outstanding patriotic merits in the social scientific artistic or literary field former presidents of the republic are ex officio life senators italys three major political parties are the democratic party forza italia and the five stars movement during the 2013 general election these three parties won 579 out of 630 seats available in the chamber of deputies and 294 out of 315 in the senate 97 most of the remaining seats were won by a short-lived electoral bloc formed to support the outgoing prime minister mario monti the far left party left ecology freedom or by parties that contest elections only in one part of italy the northern league the south tyrolean peoples party vallée daoste and great south on 15 november 2013 58 splinter mps from forza italia founded new centre-right law and criminal justice the italian judicial system is based on roman law modified by the napoleonic code and later statutes the supreme court of cassation is the highest court in italy for both criminal and civil appeal cases the constitutional court of italy corte costituzionale rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and is a postworld war ii innovation since their appearance in the middle of the 19th century italian organised crime and criminal organisations have infiltrated the social and economic life of many regions in southern italy the most notorious of which being the sicilian mafia which would later expand into some foreign countries including the united states the mafia receipts may reach 9 98 99 of italys gdp 100 a 2009 report identified 610 comuni which have a strong mafia presence where 13 million italians live and 14.6 of the italian gdp is produced 101 102 the calabrian ndrangheta nowadays probably the most powerful crime syndicate of italy accounts alone for 3 of the

eighth-largest in the world 115 the country is a founding member of the g7 g8 the eurozone and the oecd italy is regarded as one of the worlds most industrialised nations and a leading country in world trade and exports 116 117 118 it is a highly developed country with the worlds 8th highest quality of life 20 and the 25th human development index the country is well known for its creative and innovative business 119 a large and competitive agricultural sector 120 italy is the worlds largest wine producer 121 and for its influential and high-quality automobile machinery food design and fashion industry 122 123 124 italy is the worlds sixth largest manufacturing country 126 characterised by a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size and a large number of dynamic small and medium-sized enterprises notoriously clustered in several industrial districts which are the backbone of the italian industry this has produced a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of niche market and luxury products that if on one side is less capable to compete on the quantity on the other side is more capable of facing the competition from china and other emerging asian economies based on lower labour costs with higher quality products 127 the country was the worlds 7th largest exporter in 2009 128 italys closest trade ties are with the other countries of the european union with whom it conducts about 59 of its total trade its largest eu trade partners in order of market share are germany  12.9 france  11.4 and spain  7.4 129 finally

eurozone which represents around 330 million citizens its monetary policy is set by the european central bank italy has been hit very hard by the financial crisis of 2007–08 and the subsequent european sovereign-debt crisis that exacerbated the countrys structural problems 133 effectively after a strong gdp growth of 5–6 per year from the 1950s to the early 1970s 134 and a progressive slowdown in the 1980-90s the country virtually stagnated in the 2000s 135 136 the political efforts to revive growth with massive government spending eventually produced a severe rise in public debt that stood at over 135 of gdp in 2014 ranking second in the eu only after the greek one at 174 137 for all that the largest chunk of italian public debt is owned by national subjects a major difference between italy and greece 138 and the level of household debt is much lower than the oecd average 139 a gaping northsouth divide is a major factor of socio-economic weakness 140 it can be noted by the huge difference in statistical income between the northern and southern regions and municipalities 141 the richest region lombardy earns 127 of the national gdp per capita while the poorest calabria only 61 142 the unemployment rate  11.9 stands slightly above the eurozone average 143 however the average figure is 7.9 in the north and 20.2 in the south 144 agricolture according

of the leading in olive oil fruits apples olives grapes oranges lemons pears apricots hazelnuts peaches cherries plums strawberries and kiwifruits and vegetables especially artichokes and tomatoes the most famous italian wines are probably the tuscan chianti and the piedmontese barolo other famous wines are barbaresco barbera dasti brunello di montalcino frascati montepulciano dabruzzo morellino di scansano and the sparkling wines franciacorta and prosecco quality goods in which italy specialises particularly the already mentioned wines and regional cheeses are often protected under the quality assurance labels docdop this geographical indication certificate which is attributed by the european union is considered important in order to avoid confusion with low-quality mass-produced ersatz products tourism with 50.7 million tourists a year  2015 italy is the fifth most visited country in international tourism arrivals and the sixth highest tourism earner in the world 147 tourism is one of italys fastest growing and most profitable industrial sectors with an estimated revenue of €189.1 billion 148 people mainly visit italy for its rich art cuisine history fashion and culture its

civilian air fleet of about 389,000 units and a merchant fleet of 581 ships 158 italy needs to import about 80 of its energy requirements 159 160 161 italy does not invest enough to maintain its drinking water supply and sanitation infrastructure while water and sanitation tariffs are among the lowest in the european union the galli law passed in 1993 aimed at raising the level of investment and to improve service quality by consolidating service providers making them more efficient and increasing the level of cost recovery through tariff revenues despite these reforms investment levels have declined and remain far from sufficient 162 163 164 science and technology through the centuries italy has fostered the scientific community that produced many major discoveries in physics and the other sciences during the renaissance italian polymaths such as leonardo da vinci  1452–1519 michelangelo  1475–1564 and leon battista alberti  1404–72 made important contributions to a variety of fields including biology architecture and engineering galileo galilei  1564–1642 a physicist mathematician and astronomer played a major role in the scientific revolution his achievements include key improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and ultimately the triumph of copernicanism over the ptolemaic model other astronomers suchs as giovanni domenico cassini  1625–1712 and giovanni schiaparelli  1835–1910 made many important discoveries about the solar system in mathematics joseph louis lagrange born giuseppe lodovico lagrangia 1736–1813 was active before leaving italy fibonacci c 1170  c 1250 and gerolamo cardano  1501–76 made fundamental advances in mathematics luca pacioli established accounting to the world physicist enrico fermi  1901–54 a nobel prize laureate led the team in chicago that developed the first nuclear reactor and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics including the co-development of the quantum theory and was one of the key figures in the creation of the nuclear weapon he emilio g segrè and a number of italian physicists were forced to leave italy in the 1930s by fascist laws against jews including emilio g segrè  1905–89 who discovered the elements technetium and astatine and the antiproton 169 and bruno rossi  1905–93 a pioneer in cosmic rays and x-ray astronomy other prominent physicists include amedeo avogadro most noted for his contributions to molecular theory in particular the avogadros law and the avogadro constant evangelista torricelli inventor of barometer alessandro volta inventor of

the pion or pi-meson decay in 1947 ennio de giorgi a wolf prize in mathematics recipient in 1990 solved bernsteins problem about minimal surfaces and the 19th hilbert problem on the regularity of solutions of elliptic partial differential equations demographics at the end of 2013 italy had 60,782,668 inhabitants 170 the resulting population density at 202 inhabitants per square kilometre  520sqmi is higher than that of most western european countries however the distribution of the population is widely uneven the most densely populated areas are the po valley that accounts for almost a half of the national population and the metropolitan areas of rome and naples while vast regions such as the alps and apennines highlands the plateaus of basilicata and the island of sardinia are very sparsely populated the population of italy almost doubled during the 20th century but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven because of large-scale internal migration from the rural south to the industrial cities of the north a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the italian economic miracle of the 1950–1960s high fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s after which they start to dramatically decline leading to rapid population ageing at the end of the 2000s decade one in five italians was over 65 years old 171 however in recent years italy experienced a significant growth in birth rates 172 the total fertility rate has also climbed from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.41 in 2008 173 the tfr is expected to reach 1.6–1.8 in 2030 174 from the late 19th century until the 1960s italy was a country of mass emigration between 1898 and 1914 the peak years of italian diaspora approximately 750,000 italians emigrated each year 175 the diaspora concerned more than 25 million italians and it is considered the biggest mass migration of contemporary times 176 as a result today more than 4.1 million italian citizens are living abroad 177 while at least 60 million people of full or part italian ancestry live outside of italy most notably in argentina 178 brazil 179 uruguay 180 venezuela 181 the united states 182 canada 183 australia 184 and france 185  v t e metropolitan cities 186 and functional urban areas 187 ethnic groups in 2014 italy had about 4.9 million foreign residents 188 making up some 8.1 of the total population the figures include more than half a million children born in italy to foreign nationalssecond generation immigrants but exclude foreign nationals who have subsequently acquired italian nationality this applies to about 130,000 people a year 189 the official figures also exclude illegal immigrants that were estimated in 2008 to number at least 670,000 190 starting from the early 1980s until then a linguistically and culturally homogeneous society italy begun to attract substantial flows of foreign immigrants 191 after the fall of the berlin wall and more recently the 2004 and 2007 enlargements of the european union large waves of migration originated from the former socialist countries of eastern europe especially romania albania ukraine and poland an equally important source of immigration is neighbouring north africa in particular morocco egypt and tunisia with soaring arrivals as a consequence of the arab spring furthermore in recent years growing migration fluxes from asia-pacific notably china 192 and the philippines and latin america have been recorded currently about one million romanian citizens around one tenth of them being roma 193 are officially registered as living in italy representing thus the most important individual country of origin followed by albanians and moroccans with about 500,000 people each the number of unregistered romanians is difficult to estimate but the balkan investigative reporting network suggested in 2007 that there might have been half a million or more 194note 3 overall at the end of the 2000s decade the foreign born population of italy was from europe  54 africa  22 asia  16 the americas  8 and oceania  0.06 the distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in italy 87 of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country the most economically developed areas while only 13 live in the southern half of the peninsula languages italys official language is italian 196 it is estimated that there are about 64 million native italian speakers 197 198 199 while the total number of italian speakers including those who use it as a second language is about 85 million 200 italy has numerous regional dialects 201 however the establishment of a national education system has led to decrease in variation in the languages spoken across the country during the 20th century standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to economic growth and the rise of mass media and television the state broadcaster rai helped set a standard italian twelve historical minority languages are legally recognised albanian catalan german greek slovene croatian french franco-provençal friulian ladin occitan and sardinian law number 482 of 15 december 1999 203 french is co-official in the valle daostaalthough in fact franco-provencal is more commonly spoken there 204 german has the same status in south tyrol as in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring trentino does ladin slovene is officially recognised in the provinces of trieste gorizia and udine because of significant recent immigration italy has sizeable populations whose native language is not italian according to the italian national institute of statistics romanian is the most common mother tongue among foreign residents in italy almost 800,000 people speak romanian as their first language  21.9 of the foreign residents aged 6 and over other prevalent mother tongues are arabic spoken by over 475,000 people 13.1 of foreign residents albanian  380,000 people and spanish  255,000 people other languages spoken in italy are ukrainian hindi polish and tamil amongst others 205 according to the 2015 ef education first report italy is ranked 28th out of 70 countries in all around the world registering a medium competence level of english attributed to the value of 54,02 206 religion roman catholicism is by far the largest religion in the country although catholicism is no longer officially the state religion 207 in 2010 the proportion of italians that identify themselves as roman catholic was 81.2 208 the holy see the episcopal jurisdiction of rome contains the central government of the entire roman catholic church including various agencies essential to administration diplomatically it is recognised by other subjects of international law as a sovereign entity headed by the pope who is also the bishop of rome with which diplomatic relations can be maintained 209 210 often incorrectly referred to as the vatican the holy see is not the same entity as the vatican city state which came into existence only in 1929 the holy see dates back to early christian times ambassadors are officially accredited not to the vatican city state but to the holy see and papal representatives to states and international organisations are recognised as representing the holy see not the vatican city state minority christian faiths in italy include eastern orthodox waldensians and other protestant communities in 2011 there were an estimated 1.5 million orthodox christians in italy or 2.5 of the population 211 0.5 million pentecostals and evangelicals of whom 0.4 million are members of the assemblies of god 235,685 jehovahs witnesses 212 30,000 waldensians 213 25,000 seventh-day adventists 22,000 latter-day saints 15,000 baptists plus some 5,000 free baptists 7,000 lutherans 4,000 methodists affiliated with the waldensian church 214 one of the longest-established minority religious faiths in italy is judaism jews having been present in ancient rome since before the birth of christ italy has for centuries welcomed jews expelled from other countries notably spain however as a result of the holocaust about 20 of italian jews lost their lives 215 this together with the emigration that preceded and followed world war ii has left only a small community of around 28,400 jews in italy 216 soaring immigration in the last two decades has been accompanied by an increase in non-christian faiths in 2010 there were 1.6 million muslims in italy forming 2.6 of population 208 in addition there are more than 200,000 followers of faiths originating in the indian subcontinent with some 70,000 sikhs with 22 gurdwaras across the country 217 70,000 hindus and 50,000 buddhists 218 there were an estimated 4,900 baháís in italy in 2005 219 the italian state as a measure to protect religious freedom devolves shares of income tax to recognised religious communities under a regime known as eight per thousand otto per mille donations are allowed to christian jewish buddhist and hindu communities however islam remains excluded since no muslim communities have yet signed a concordat with the italian state 220 taxpayers who do not wish to fund a religion contribute their share to the state welfare system  221 education education in italy is free and mandatory from ages six to sixteen 223 and consists of five stages kindergarten scuola dellinfanzia primary school scuola primaria lower secondary school scuola secondaria di primo grado upper secondary school scuola secondaria di secondo grado and university università 224 primary education lasts eight years the students are given a basic education in italian english mathematics natural sciences history geography social studies physical education and visual and musical arts secondary education lasts for five years and includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels the liceo prepares students for university studies with a classical or scientific curriculum while the istituto tecnico and the istituto professionale prepare pupils for vocational education in 2012 the italian secondary education has been evalued as slightly below the oecd average with a strong and steady improvement in science and mathematics results since 2003 225 however a wide gap exists between northern schools which performed significantly better than the national average among the best in the world in some subjects and schools in the south that had much poorer results 226 tertiary education in italy is divided between public universities private universities and the prestigious and selective superior graduate schools such as the scuola normale superiore di pisa the university system in italy is generally regarded as poor for a world cultural powerhouse with no universities ranked among the 100 world best and only 20 among the top 500 227 however the current government has scheduled major reforms and investments in order to improve the overall internationalisation and quality of the system 228 health the italian state runs a universal public healthcare system since 1978 231 however healthcare is provided to all citizens and residents by a mixed public-private system the public part is the servizio sanitario nazionale which is organised under the ministry of health and administered on a devolved regional basis healthcare spending in italy accounted for 9.2 of the national gdp in 2012 very close the oecd countries average of 9.3 232 italy in 2000 ranked as having the worlds 2nd best healthcare system 231 233 and the worlds 2nd best healthcare performance life expectancy in italy is 80 for males and 85 for females placing the country 6th in the world for life expectancy in comparison to other western countries italy has a relatively low rate of adult obesity below 10 234 probably thanks to the health benefits of the mediterranean diet the proportion of daily smokers was 22 in 2012 down from 24.4 in 2000 but still slightly above the oecd average 232 smoking in public places including bars restaurants night clubs and offices has been restricted to specially ventilated rooms since 2005 235 culture for centuries divided by politics and geography until its eventual unification in 1861 italy has developed a unique culture shaped by a multitude of regional customs and local centres of power and patronage 236 during the middle ages and the renaissance a number of magnificent courts competed for attracting the best architects artistis and scholars thus producing an immense legacy of monuments paintings music and literature 237 italy has more unesco world heritage sites  51 than any other country in the world and has rich collections of art culture and literature from many different periods the country has had a broad cultural influence worldwide also because numerous italians emigrated to other places during the italian diaspora furthermore the nation has overall an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort museums palaces buildings statues churches art galleries villas fountains historic houses and archaeological remains 238 architecture italy has a very broad and diverse architectural style which cannot be simply classified by period but also by region because of italys division into several regional states until 1861 this has created a highly diverse and eclectic range in architectural designs italy is known for its considerable architectural achievements 241 such as the construction of arches domes and similar structures during ancient rome the founding of the renaissance architectural movement in the late-14th to 16th centuries and being the homeland of palladianism a style of construction which inspired movements such as that of neoclassical architecture and influenced the designs which noblemen built their country houses all over the world notably in the uk australia and the us during the late 17th to early 20th centuries several of the finest works in western architecture such as the colosseum the milan cathedral and florence cathedral the leaning tower of pisa and the building designs of venice are found in italy italian architecture has also widely influenced the architecture of the world british architect inigo jones inspired by the designs of italian buildings and cities brought back the ideas of italian renaissance architecture to 17th-century england being inspired by andrea palladio 242 additionally italianate architecture popular abroad since the 19th century was used to describe foreign architecture which was built in an italian style especially modelled on renaissance architecture visual art the history of italian visual art is part of western painting history roman art was influenced by greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient greek painting however roman painting does have important unique characteristics the only surviving roman paintings are wall paintings many from villas in campania in southern italy such painting can be grouped into 4 main styles or periods 244 and may contain the first examples of trompe-lœil pseudo-perspective and pure landscape 245 panel painting becomes more common during the romanesque period under the heavy influence of byzantine icons towards the middle of the 13th century medieval art and gothic painting became more realistic with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in italy with cimabue and then his pupil giotto from giotto on the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative they are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture the italian renaissance is said by many to be the golden age of painting roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern italy in italy artists like paolo uccello fra angelico masaccio piero della francesca andrea mantegna filippo lippi giorgione tintoretto sandro botticelli leonardo da vinci michelangelo buonarroti raphael giovanni bellini and titian took painting to a higher level through the use of perspective the study of human anatomy and proportion and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520 and his great masterpieces including his david pietà moses other prominent renaissance sculptors include lorenzo ghiberti luca della robbia donatello filippo brunelleschi andrea del verrocchio in the 15th and 16th centuries the high renaissance gave rise to a stylised art known as mannerism in place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century the mannerists sought instability artifice and doubt the unperturbed faces and gestures of piero della francesca and the calm virgins of raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of pontormo and the emotional intensity of el greco in the 17th century among the greatest painters of italian baroque are caravaggio annibale carracci artemisia gentileschi mattia preti carlo saraceni and bartolomeo manfredi subsequently in the 18th century italian rococo was mainly inspired by french rococo since france was the founding
