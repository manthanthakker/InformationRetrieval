pubmed pubmed is a free search engine accessing primarily the medline database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics the united states national library of medicine nlm at the national institutes of health maintains the database as part of the entrez system of information retrieval from 1971 to 1997 medline online access to the medlars online computerized database had been primarily through institutional facilities such as university libraries pubmed first released in january 1996 ushered in the era of private free home- and office-based medline searching 1 the pubmed system was offered free to the public in june 1997 when medline searches via the web were demonstrated in a ceremony by vice president al gore 2  contents 1 content 2 characteristics 2.1

id  contentedit in addition to medline pubmed provides access to older references from the print version of index medicus back to 1951 and earlier references to some journals before they were indexed in index medicus and medline for instance science bmj and annals of surgery very recent entries to records for an article before it is indexed with medical subject headings mesh and added to medline and a collection of books available full-text and other subsets of nlm records 3 pmc citations many pubmed records contain links to full text articles some of which are freely available often in pubmed central 4 and local mirrors such as uk pubmed central 5 information about the journals indexed in medline and available through pubmed is found in the nlm catalog 6 as of 8 february 2015update pubmed has over 24.6 million records going back to 1966 selectively to the year 1865 and very selectively to 1809 about 500,000 new records are added each year as of the same dateupdate 13.1 million of pubmeds records are listed with their abstracts and 14.2 million articles have links to full-text of which 3.8 million articles are available full-text for free for any usercitation needed in 2016 nlm changed the indexing system so that publishers will be able to directly correct typos and errors in pubmed indexed articles 7 characteristicsedit standard searchesedit simple searches on pubmed can be carried out by entering key aspects of a subject into pubmeds search window pubmed translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names relevant mesh medical subject headings terms synonyms boolean operators and nests the resulting terms appropriately enhancing the search formulation significantly in particular by routinely combining using the or operator textwords and mesh terms the examples given in a pubmed tutorial 8 demonstrate how this automatic process works likewise the new pubmed interface launched in october 2009 encourages the use of such quick google-like search formulations they have also been described as telegram searches 9 comprehensive searchesedit for comprehensive optimal searches in pubmed it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of its core component medline and especially of the mesh medical subject headings controlled vocabulary used to index medline articles they may also require complex search strategies use of field names tags proper use of limits and other features and are best carried out by pubmed search specialists or librarians 10 who are able to select the right type of search and carefully adjust it for precision and recall 11 journal article parametersedit when a journal article is indexed numerous article parameters are extracted and stored as structured information such parameters are article type mesh terms eg clinical trial secondary identifiers mesh terms language country of the journal or publication history e-publication date print journal publication date publication type clinical queriessystematic reviewsedit publication type parameter enables many special features a special feature of pubmed is its clinical queries section where clinical categories systematic reviews and medical genetics subjects can be searched with study-type filters automatically applied to identify substantial robust studies 12 as these clinical girish can generate small sets of robust studies with considerable precision it has been suggested that this pubmed section can be used as a point-of-care resource 13 secondary idedit since july 2005 the medline article indexing process extracts important identifiers from the article abstract and puts those in a field called secondary identifier si the secondary identifier field is to store accession numbers to various databases of molecular sequence data gene expression or chemical compounds and clinical trial ids for clinical trials pubmed extracts trial ids for the two largest trial registries clinicaltrialsgov nct identifier and the international standard randomized controlled trial number register irctn identifier 14 see alsoedit a reference which is judged particularly relevant can be marked and related articles can be identified if relevant several studies can be selected and related articles to all of them can be generated on pubmed or any of the other ncbi entrez databases using the find related data option the related articles are then listed in order of relatedness to create these lists of related articles pubmed compares words from the title and abstract of each citation as well as the mesh headings assigned using a powerful word-weighted algorithm 15 the related articles function has been judged to be so precise that some researchers suggest it can be used instead of a full search 16 mapping to mesh headings and subheadingsedit a strong feature of pubmed is its ability to automatically link to mesh terms and subheadings examples would be bad breath links to and includes in the search halitosis heart attack to myocardial infarction breast cancer to breast neoplasms where appropriate these mesh terms are automatically expanded that is include more specific terms terms like nursing are automatically linked to nursing mesh or nursing subheading this important feature makes pubmed searches automatically more sensitive and avoids false-negative missed hits by compensating for the diversity of medical terminology my ncbiedit the pubmed optional facility my ncbi with free registration provides tools for saving searches filtering search results setting up automatic updates sent by e-mail saving sets of references retrieved as part of a pubmed search configuring display formats or highlighting search terms and a wide range of other options 17 the my ncbi area can be accessed from any computer with web-access an earlier version of my ncbi was called pubmed cubby 18 linkoutedit linkout a nlm facility to link and make available full-text local journal holdings 19 some 3,200 sites mainly academic institutions participate in this nlm facility as of march 2010update from aalborg university in denmark to zymogenetics in seattle 20 users at these institutions see their institutions logo within the pubmed search result if the journal is held at that institution and can access the full-text pubmed commonsedit in 2016 pubmed allows authors of articles to comment on articles indexed by pubmed this feature was initially tested in a pilot mode since 2013 and was made permanent in 2016 21 pubmed for handheldsmobilesedit pubmedmedline can be accessed via handheld devices using for instance the pico option for focused clinical questions created by the nlm 22 a pubmed mobile option providing access to a mobile friendly simplified pubmed version is also available 23 askmedlineedit askmedline a free-text natural language query tool for medlinepubmed developed by the nlm also suitable for handhelds 24 pubmed identifieredit a pmid pubmed identifier or pubmed unique identifier 25 is a unique integer value starting at 1 assigned to each pubmed record a pmid is not the same as a pmcid which is the identifier for all works published in the free-to-access pubmed central 26 the assignment of a pmid or pmcid to a publication tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content pmids are assigned to letters to the editor editorial opinions op-ed columns and any other piece that the editor chooses to include in the journal as well as peer-reviewed papers the existence of the identification number is also not proof that the papers have not been retracted for fraud incompetence or misconduct the announcement about any corrections to original papers may be assigned a pmid alternative interfacesedit the national library of medicine leases the medline information to a number of private vendors such as ovid dialog ebsco knowledge finder and many other commercial non-commercial and academic providers 27 as of october 2008update more than 500 licenses had been issued more than 200 of them to providers outside the united states as licenses to use medline data are available for free the nlm in effect provides a free testing ground for a wide range 28 of alternative interfaces and 3rd party additions to pubmed one of a very few large professionally curated databases which offers this option lu 28 identifies a sample of 28 current and free web-based pubmed versions requiring no installation or registration which are grouped into four categories ranking search results for instance etblast hakia medlineranker 29 misearch 30 clustering results by topics authors journals etc for instance anne otate 31 clustermed 32 enhancing semantics and visualization for instance ebimed 33 medevi 34 scicurve note citexplore was withdrawn from service on 15 february 2013 35 replaced by europe pubmed central 36 improved search interface and retrieval experience for instance askmedline 37 38 babelmesh 39 and pubcrawler 40 gopubmed is a knowledge-based gene ontology and mesh search engine for pubmed gopubmed claims to be a semantic search engine but searches return exactly the same results as pubmed itself expertscape provides search and ranking of medical and biomedical expertise by specific diagnosis technique or other terminology results are based on analysis derived from most recent ten years of pubmed data 41 search term forwarders like ossipubmed online o groth which runs searches on multiple external platforms derived from the original boolean search terms reference-to-pubmed transcriptors like ossipubmed online o groth which retrieves the pmid from one-letter coded journal abbreviations to get the full-text articles link-out arborizers ossipubmed online o groth which tries to retrieve available pdfs from additional hosts as most of these and other alternatives rely essentially on pubmedmedline data leased under license from the nlmpubmed the term pubmed derivatives has been suggested 28 without the need to store about 90gb of original pubmed datasets anybody can write pubmed applications using the eutils-application program interface as described in the e-utilities
