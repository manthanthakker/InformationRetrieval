the site a school health services public transport and road links to the a281 and an expanded business district the project was designed to be an exemplar of green and sustainable living in late 2007 dunsfold park ltd applied to have their plans for the new town selected as one of the then labour governments proposed eco-towns on 3 april 2008 dunsfold park was one of over 40 proposals denied eco-town status by the then housing minister caroline flint the governments summary assessment said that the bid was too small in terms of house numbers because the proposal at dunsfold was for only 2,600 houses whereas the minimum size for an eco-town was 5,000 the assessment also said that the public transport offering needed further work in may 2008 dunsfold park limited applied to waverley borough council for planning consent for the eco-settlement it was opposed by local residents surrey county council four borough councils and 13 parish councils as well as the south east england regional assembly and the south east england development agency it received support from age concern waverley guildford labour party farnham labour party cranleigh labour party and the former lib dem mp for guildford sue doughty it also received support from some environmentalists including leading national authorities on sustainable living such as professor roland clift and from national friends of the earth for its innovative approach and contribution to sustainable development friends of the earth also supported the development on the basis that re-development as an eco-settlement would remove the threat of aviation expansion at dunsfold once and for all however the proposal was refused planning permission by the local borough council waverley and in 2009 rejected on appeal by the then secretary of state john denham although the owners say they still hope to persuade the authorities that eco-settlement remains the best long-term future for the site they say they are now concentrating on expanding and promoting the underlying aviation potential of the aerodrome which is still in operational use dunsfold parks existing lawful use is in part as an aerodrome under a series of temporary planning consents which contain restrictions on the levels of aircraft movement and restrict flying to certain times however the long-term and permanent underlying use has been a matter of considerable dispute between the owners and the council in april 2011 dunsfold park claimed that the use of the site for aviation was entirely unrestricted on the grounds that the use predated the introduction of the planning acts or alternatively that a 60-year-old planning consent dating from 1951 allowed the unrestricted use of the aerodrome for aviation the claim led to objections from parties such as all the local parish councils and bodies such as the council to protect rural england and friends of the earth and concern was expressed by local mps in june 2011 waverley borough council refused dunsfold park ltds application for a certificate of lawful use as an aerodrome dunsfold appealed but the appeal was rejected in april 2012 when rejecting the appeal the inspector made reference to the old planning consent granted in 1951 for erection repair and flight testing of aircraft stating that it was now agreed by all parties that it was and is a permanent permission and that the use at dunsfold will revert to the 1951 consent in 2018 on expiry of the existing temporary consents in april 2014 lord justice sullivan at the high court said the 1951 permission for flight testing did not amount to consent for unrestricted flying 2 memorialedit a memorial funded by public subscription was erected outside the nearby alfold barn pub on the a281 road
