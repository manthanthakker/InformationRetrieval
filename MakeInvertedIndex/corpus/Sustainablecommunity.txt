credibility to take initiatives to access and deploy resources in ways reflecting local conditions that allows them the capacity to manage and lead urban development for the good of the environment  4 it is also necessary to implement sustainable communities in countries that are industrialized because cities are where most environmental and social problems dwell when looking at and comparing sustainable cities certain indicators may be used does the city have any smart growth programs that are designed to help manage growth and avoid and eliminate urban sprawl and minimize impacts on physical environment  4 does the city have zoning plans that demonstrate goals for the city in a way that create environmentally-sensitive areas and maintain them  4 does the city follow any legal policies that allow advocates and activists to create programs that would help the city become sustainable  22 how involved in the environmental and social justice movement are programs within the

citizens believe no change will occur when becoming politically active a citizen takes into account the history of the city government the governments actions and government interactions with other citizens 26 after noting the citys sustainability level it is important to note what kinds of communities are targeted and how they are affected through these programs and what kinds of strategies are

democratic and collaborate with the environmental justice movement 5 promoting a securitization agenda british geographer mike raco argues that the uks sustainable communities plan employs the discourse of sustainability as a series of potentially repressive and counter-productive policy measures 34 accommodating to neoliberal economic systems instead of confronting them while some rationales for sustainable communities conflict with market-driven agendas economic growth characterizes the means and ends of some initiatives additionally sustainable communities reject the notion that development itself is fundamentally socially divisive or environmentally destructive 35 referencesedit
