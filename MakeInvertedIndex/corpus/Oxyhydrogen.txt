oxyhydrogen oxyhydrogen is a mixture of hydrogen h2 and oxygen o2 gases this gaseous mixture is used for torches to process refractory materials and was the first 1 gaseous mixture used for welding theoretically a ratio of 2:1 hydrogenoxygen is enough to achieve maximum efficiency in practice a ratio 4:1 or 5:1 is needed to avoid an oxidizing flame 2 this mixture may also be referred to as knallgas scandinavian and german knallgas bang-gas although some authors define knallgas to be a generic term for the mixture of fuel with the precise amount of oxygen required for complete combustion thus 2:1 oxyhydrogen would be called hydrogen-knallgas 3 browns gas 4 and hho are fringe science terms for a 2:1 mixture of oxyhydrogen obtained under certain special conditions its proponents claim

autoignition occurs at about 570c  1065f 5dead link the minimum energy required to ignite such a mixture with a spark is about 20 microjoules 5dead link at standard temperature and pressure oxyhydrogen can burn when it is between about 4 and 95 hydrogen by volume 5dead link when ignited the gas mixture converts to water vapor and releases energy which sustains the reaction 241.8 kj of energy lhv for every mole of h2 burned the amount of heat energy released is independent of the mode of combustion but the temperature of the flame varies 6 the maximum temperature of about 2,800c  5,100f is achieved with an exact stoichiometric mixture about 700c  1,300f hotter than a hydrogen flame in air 7 8 9 when either of the gases are mixed in excess of this ratio or when mixed with an inert gas like nitrogen the heat must spread throughout a greater quantity of matter and the temperature will be lower 6 productionedit a pure stoichiometric mixture may be obtained by water electrolysis which uses an electric current to dissociate the water molecules william nicholson was the first to decompose water in this manner in 1800 in theory the input energy of a closed system will always equal the output energy as the first law of thermodynamics states however in practice no systems are perfectly closed and the energy required to generate the oxyhydrogen will always exceed the energy released by combusting it even at maximum practical efficiency as the second law of thermodynamics implies see electrolysis of waterefficiency applicationsedit lightingedit many forms of oxyhydrogen lamps have been described such as the limelight which used an oxyhydrogen flame to heat a piece of lime to white hot incandescence 10 because of the explosiveness of the oxyhydrogen limelights have been replaced by electric lighting oxyhydrogen blowpipeedit the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe was developed by english mineralogist edward daniel clarke and american chemist robert hare in the early nineteenth century it produced a flame hot enough to melt such refractory materials as platinum porcelain fire brick and corundum and was a valuable tool in several fields of science 11 it is used in the verneuil process to produce synthetic corundumcitation needed oxyhydrogen torchedit an oxyhydrogen torch is an oxy-gas torch which burns hydrogen the fuel with oxygen the oxidizer it is used for cutting and welding 12 metals glass and thermoplastics 10 due to competition from the acetylene-fueled cutting torch and from arc welding the oxyhydrogen torch is seldom used today but it remains the preferred cutting tool in some niche applicationssee oxy-fuel welding and cutting oxyhydrogen was once used in working platinum because at the time such a torch was the only device that could attain the temperature required to melt the metal 1,768.3c  3,214.9f 6 these techniques have been superseded by the electric arc furnace browns gas edit browns gas is oxyhydrogen with a 2:1 molar ratio of h2 and o2 gases the same proportion as in water it is named after yull brown who claimed that it could be used as a fuel for the internal combustion engine 4 13 its also called hho gas after the claims of fringe physicist 14 ruggero santilli who claims that his hho gas produced by a special apparatus is a new form of water with new properties based on his fringe theory of magnecules 13 many other pseudoscientific claims have been made about browns gass pretended ability to neutralize radioactive waste help plants to germinate etc 13 oxyhydrogen is often mentioned in conjunction with vehicles that claim to use water as a fuel the most common and decisive counter-argument against producing this gas on board to use as a fuel or fuel additive is that more energy is needed to split water molecules than is recouped by burning the resulting gas 4 15 additionally the volume of gas that can be produced for on-demand consumption through electrolysis is very small in comparison to the volume consumed by an internal combustion engine 16 an article in popular mechanics reported that browns gas does not increase the fuel economy in automobiles 17 water-fueled cars should not be confused with hydrogen-fueled cars where the hydrogen is produced elsewhere and used as fuel or where it is used as fuel enhancement referencesedit gnd 7731691-5
