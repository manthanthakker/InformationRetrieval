wood gas generator a wood gas generator is a gasification unit which converts timber or charcoal into wood gas a syngas consisting of atmospheric nitrogen carbon monoxide hydrogen traces of methane and other gases which - after cooling and filtering - can then be used to power an internal combustion engine or for other purposes historically wood gas generators were often mounted on vehicles but present studies and developments concentrate mostly on stationary plants  contents 1 history 1.1 origins 1.2 post wwii 2 design 2.1 advantages 2.2 disadvantages 2.3 safety consideration 3 media

historyedit originsedit gasification had been an important and common technology which was widely used to generate coal gas from coal mainly for lighting purposes during the 19th and early 20th century when the first stationary internal combustion engines based on the otto cycle became available in the 1870s they began displacing steam engines as prime movers in many works requiring stationary motive power adoption accelerated after the otto engines patent expired in 1886 the potential and practical applicability of gasification to internal combustion engines were well-understood from the earliest days of their development in 1873 thaddeus s c lowe developed and patented the water gas process by which large amounts of hydrogen gas could be generated for residential and commercial use in heating and lighting unlike the common coal gas or coke gas which was used in municipal service this gas provided a more efficient heating fuel during the late 19th century internal combustion engines were sometimes fueled by coal gas and during the early 20th century many stationary engines switched to using producer gas created from coke which was substantially cheaper than coal gas which was based on the distillation pyrolysis of more expensive coal in about 1920 french inventor georges imbert created the imbert downdraft generator during world war ii gasoline was rationed and in short supply in great britain france the united states and germany large numbers of such generators were constructed or improvised to convert wood and coal into fuel for vehicles commercial generators were in production before and after the war for use in special circumstances or in distressed economies germany produced gazogene units for vehicles including cars trucks artillery tractors and even tanks to preserve the limited supplies of fuel 1 even in non-combatant countries such as sweden or brazil gasogene was popular as oil became hard to obtain in brazil a racer named chico landi won at são paulos interlagos circuit in 1944 driving a wood gas-powered alfa romeo 2 post wwiiedit the us federal emergency management agency fema published a book in march 1989 describing how to build a gas generator in an emergency when oil was not available 3 a project about the energy future of europe was begun in 2005 in güssing austria with contribution of european union research furtherance the project consisted of a power plant with a wood gas generator and a gas engine to convert the wood gas into 2mw electric power and 4.5mw heat at the wood gas power plant are also two containers for experiments with wood gas in one container is an experiment to convert wood gas using the fischer-tropsch process to a diesel-like fuel by october 2005 it was possible to convert 5kg wood into 1 litre fuel designedit there is a rich literature on gas-works town-gas gas-generation wood-gas and producer gas that is now in the public domain due to its age 4 most successful wood gas generators in use in europe and the united states are some variation of the earlier imbert design wood gas generators often use wood however charcoal can also be used as a fuel it is denser and produces a cleaner gas without the tarry volatiles and excessive water content of wood the fema unit from 1989 has distinct benefits over the earlier european units such as easier refueling and construction but is less popular than the earlier imbert design because of significant new problems which include a lack of a fixed oxidization zone and allows the oxidization zone to creep to a larger area causing a drop in temperature a lower operating temperature leads to tar production and it lacks a true reduction zone further increasing this designs propensity to produce tar tar in the wood gas stream is considered a dirty gas and tar will gum up a motor quickly possibly leading to stuck valves and rings a new design known as the keith gasifier improves on the fema unit incorporating extensive heat recovery and eliminating the tar problem testing at auburn university has shown it to be 37 more efficient than running gasoline 5 this system set the world speed record for biomass powered vehicles 6 and has made several cross country tours 7 8 the united nations produced the foa 72 document 9 with details about their wood gas generator design and construction as does world bank technical paper 296 10 advantagesedit wood gas generators have a number of advantages over use of petroleum fuels they can be used to run internal combustion engines or gas turbines for maximal efficiency using wood a renewable resource and in the absence of petroleum or natural gas for example during a fuel shortage they have a closed carbon cycle contribute less to global warming and are sustainable in nature they can be relatively easily fabricated in a crisis using materials on hand they are far cleaner burning than a wood fire or a gasoline-powered engine without emissions controls producing little if any soot when used in a stationary design they reach their true potential as they are feasible to use in small combined heat and power scenarios with heat recovery from the wood gas producer and possibly the enginegenerator for example to heat water for hydronic heating even in industrialized countries even during good economic times provided that a sufficient supply of wood is attainable larger-scale installations can reap even better efficiencies and are useful for district heating as well disadvantagesedit the disadvantages of wood gas generators are the large specific size the relatively slow starting speed the time to heat the initially cold batch of wood to the necessary temperature level can take many minutes and in bigger plants even hours until the designed power is reached a batch burning operation that some designs feature and that regularly interrupts the gas producing process the stop operation out of a high load level is difficult for example the stop of the engine using the gas the residual heat still produces gas which for a certain time leaves the gasifier either without control or has to be used in a burner the primary combustible fuel-gas produced during gasification is carbon monoxide it is an intentional fuel-product and is subsequently burned to safe carbon dioxide in the engine or other application along with the other fuel-gases however continuous exposure to carbon monoxide can be fatal to humans even in small to moderate concentrations the humidity of the wood usually 15 to 20 and the water vapor created by the o- and h-atoms of the dry wood itself about 0.4 liters of water loaded with organic substances per kg of dry wood condenses during the gas cooling and filtering procedure and yields a liquid see also wood tar which needs specific waste water treatment this treatment requires about 25 to 35 of the created wood gas energy safety considerationedit when not carefully designed and used there exists considerable potential for injury or death due to wood gas containing a large percentage of poisonous carbon monoxide co gas wood gasifiers of proven design and thoroughly tested construction are considered safe to use outdoors or in a partially enclosed space for example under a shelter open to the air on two sides they may also be considered relatively safe to use in an extremely well ventilated eg negative pressure indoor area not connected to any indoor area used for sleeping equipped with redundant more than 1 completely independent battery-powered regularly tested carbon-monoxide gas detectors however prudence must dictate that any sort of experimental wood gasifier design or new construction be thoroughly tested outdoors and only outdoors with a buddy at all times and with constant vigilance for any sign of headache drowsiness or nausea as these are the first symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning in addition mixtures of excessive quantities of air and gas should be avoided as this could lead to the deflagration explosion of the gas in question if a combustion source is present long-term storage of wood-gas except through the use of a gasholder-type water-displacement apparatus should not be attempted due to the volatile elements present in the gas which if allowed to excessively precipitate will condense in the storage vessel under no circumstances should wood-gas ever be compressed to more than 1 bar  15psi above ambient as this may induce condensation of volatiles as well as lead to the likelihood of severe injury or death due to carbon monoxide or deflagration if the vessel leaks or failscitation needed media coverageedit in 2008 an example of designing and constructing a working wood gas
