availability factor the availability factor of a power plant is the amount of time that it is able to produce electricity over a certain period divided by the amount of the time in the period occasions where only partial capacity is available may or may not be deducted where they are deducted the metric is titled equivalent availability factor eaf the availability factor should not be confused with the capacity factor the capacity factor for a period will always be less than the availability factor for the same period the difference depends on the choice to run the plant or not the availability of a power plant varies greatly depending on the type of fuel the design of the plant and how the plant is operated everything else being equal plants that are run less frequently have higher availability factors because they require less maintenance most thermal power stations such as coal geothermal and nuclear power plants have availability factors between 70 and 90 newer plants tend to have significantly higher availability factors but preventive maintenance is as important as improvements in design and technology gas turbines have relatively high availability factors ranging from 80 to 99 gas turbines are commonly used for peaking power plants co-generation plants and the first stage of combined cycle plants historically the term only referred to the power plant as fossil fuel was always available with the increased impact of renewable energy the topic of no fuel water wind sunlight may confuse the terminology the availability factor of wind and solar power plants depends on whether or not periods when the plant is operational but there is no wind or sunlight are counted as available unavailable or disregardedcitation needed if they are only counted as available during favorable times photovoltaic plants have an availability factor approaching or equal to 100 modern wind turbines also have very high availability factors about 98 however solar and wind plants have relatively low capacity factors wind capacity factors range from 20â€“40 and solar capacity factors in arizona are about 19 this makes wind and solar availability factors much lower if times when sunlight or wind are not available are deducted from the plants availability see alsoedit availability reliability engineering capacity factor generating availability data system electricity industry list of energy storage projects utilization factor forced outage rate referencesedit institute of electrical and electronics engineers std 762-2006 - ieee standard definitions for use in reporting electric generating unit reliability availability and productivity v t e availability factor base load black start capacity factor demand factor demand management eroei fault grid storage intermittency load factor load following nameplate capacity peak demand power quality power-flow study repowering variability coal fossil-fuel power station natural gas petroleum nuclear oil shale biomass biofuel geothermal hydro marine current osmotic thermal tidal wave solar wind current osmotic thermal tidal wave ac power cogeneration combined cycle cooling tower induction generator micro chp microgeneration rankine cycle three-phase electric power virtual power plant blackout rolling blackout brownout demand response distributed generation dynamic demand electric power distribution electric power system electric power transmission electrical grid high-voltage direct current load management pumped hydro power station power storage smart grid substation super grid transformer transmission system operator tso transmission tower utility pole arc-faultcircuitinterrupter earth leakage circuit breaker residual-current device gfi power-system protection protective relay digital protective relay sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker carbon offset cost of electricity by source ecotax energy subsidies feed-in tariff fossil-fuel phase-out net metering pigovian tax renewable energy certificates renewable energy payments renewable energy policy spark spread
