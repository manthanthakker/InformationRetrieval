and an estimated population of over 510 million the eu has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states eu policies aim to ensure the free movement of people goods services and capital within the internal market 13 enact legislation in justice and home affairs and maintain common policies on trade 14 agriculture 15 fisheries and regional development 16 within the schengen area passport controls have been abolished 17 a monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002 and is composed of 19 eu member states which use the euro currency the eu operates through a hybrid system of supranational and intergovernmental decision-making 18 19 the seven principal decision-making bodiesknown as the institutions of the european unionare the european council the council of the european union the european parliament the european commission the court of justice of the european union the european central bank and the european court of auditors the eu traces its origins from the european coal and steel community ecsc and the european economic community eec formed by the inner six countries in 1951 and 1958 respectively the community and its successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit the maastricht treaty established the european union in 1993 and introduced european citizenship 20 the latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the eu the treaty of lisbon came into force in 2009 covering 7.3 of the world population 21 the eu in 2016 generated a nominal gross domestic product gdp of 16.477 trillion us dollars constituting approximately 22.2 of global nominal gdp and 16.9 when measured in terms of purchasing power parity 22 additionally 26 out of 28 eu countries have a very high human development index according to the united nations development programme in 2012 the eu was awarded the nobel peace prize 23 through the common foreign and security policy the eu has developed a role in external relations and defence the union maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the united nations the world trade organization the g8 and the g-20 because of its global influence the european union has been described as a current or as a potential superpower

1945–57 after world war ii european integration was seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism which had devastated the continent 25 the 1948 hague congress was a pivotal moment in european federal history as it led to the creation of the european movement international and of the college of europe where europes future leaders would live and study together 26 1952 saw the creation of the european coal and steel community which was declared to be a first step in the federation of europe 27 the supporters of the community included alcide de gasperi jean monnet robert schuman and paul-henri spaak 28 treaty of rome  1957–92 in 1957 belgium france italy luxembourg the netherlands and west germany signed the treaty of rome which created the european economic community eec and established a customs union they also signed another pact creating the european atomic energy community euratom for co-operation in developing nuclear energy both treaties came into force in 1958 28 the eec and euratom were created separately from ecsc although they shared the same courts and the common assembly the eec was headed by walter hallstein hallstein commission and euratom was headed by louis armand armand commission and then étienne hirsch euratom was to integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the eec would develop a customs union among members 29 30 through the 1960s tensions began to show with france seeking to limit supranational power nevertheless in 1965 an agreement was reached and on 1 july 1967 the merger treaty created a single set of institutions for the three communities which were collectively referred to as the european communities 31 32 jean rey presided over the first merged commission rey commission 33 in 1973 the communities enlarged to include denmark including greenland which later left the community in 1985 following a dispute over fishing rights ireland and the united kingdom 34 norway had negotiated to join at the same time but norwegian voters rejected membership in a referendum in 1979 the first direct elections to the european parliament were held 35 greece joined in 1981 portugal and spain following in 1986 36 in 1985 the schengen agreement paved the way for the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states 37 in 1986 the european flag began to be used by the community 38 and the single european act was signed in 1990 after the fall of the eastern bloc the former east germany became part of the community as part of a reunified germany 39 with further enlargement planned to include the former communist states as well as cyprus and malta the copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the eu were agreed upon in june 1993 maastricht treaty  1992–2007 the european union was formally established when the maastricht treatywhose main architects were helmut kohl and françois mitterrandcame into force on 1 november 1993 20 40 the treaty also gave the name european community to the eec even if it was referred as such before the treaty in 1995 austria finland and sweden joined the eu in 2002 euro banknotes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states since then the eurozone has increased to encompass 19 countries the euro currency became the second largest reserve currency in the world in 2004 the eu saw its biggest enlargement to date when cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia joined the union 41 lisbon treaty  2007present in 2007 romania and bulgaria became eu members the same year slovenia adopted the euro 41 followed in 2008 by cyprus and malta by slovakia in 2009 by estonia in 2011 by latvia in 2014 and by lithuania in 2015 on 1 december 2009 the lisbon treaty entered into force and reformed many aspects of the eu in particular it changed the legal structure of the european union merging the eu three pillars system into a single legal entity provisioned with a legal personality created a permanent president of the european council the first of which was herman van rompuy and strengthened the position of the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy 42 43 in 2012 the eu received the nobel peace prize for having contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation democracy and human rights in europe 44 45 in 2013 croatia became the 28th eu member 46 47 48 from the beginning of the 2010s the european union has been going through a series of tests including a debt crisis in some of the eurozone countries increasing migration from the middle east and the possible united kingdoms withdrawal from the eu 49 a referendum in the uk on its membership of the european union was held on 23 june 2016 with a majority of participants voting to leave 50 structural evolution the following timeline illustrates the integration that has led to the formation of the present union in terms of structural development driven by international treaties v t e british withdrawal a referendum on the uks membership of the european union announced by british prime minister david cameron on 20 february 2016 was held on 23 june 2016 following years of campaigning by eurosceptics the result was a majority voting to leave of 51.9 with 48.1 voting to remain on a turnout of 72.2 of registered voters 50 as of october 2016update the uk has not yet initiated the formal withdrawal procedure and will not leave the eu until either two years after it notifies the european council of its decision to withdraw or on the coming into force of a withdrawal agreement 51 geography the eus member states cover an area of 4,423,147 square kilometres  1,707,787sqmib the eus highest peak is mont blanc in the graian alps 4,810.45 metres  15,782ft above sea level 52 the lowest points in the eu are lammefjorden denmark and zuidplaspolder netherlands at 7m  23ft below sea level 53 the landscape climate and economy of the eu are influenced by its coastline which is 65,993 kilometres  41,006mi long including the overseas territories of france which are located outside the continent of europe but which are members of the union the eu experiences most types of climate from arctic north-east europe to tropical french guiana rendering meteorological averages for the eu as a whole meaningless the majority of the population lives in areas with a temperate maritime climate north-western europe and central europe a mediterranean climate southern europe or a warm summer continental or hemiboreal climate northern balkans and central europe 54 the eus population is highly urbanised with some 75 of inhabitants and growing projected to be 90 in seven member states by 2020 living in urban areas cities are largely spread out across the eu although with a large grouping in and around the benelux an increasing percentage of this is due to low density urban sprawl which is extending into natural areas in some cases this urban growth has been due to the influx of eu funds into a region 55 member states through successive enlargements the european union has grown from the six founding statesbelgium france west germany italy luxembourg and the netherlandsto the current 28 countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding treaties thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of eu membership this entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions a practice often referred to as pooling of sovereignty 56 57 to become a member a country must meet the copenhagen criteria defined at the 1993 meeting of the european council in copenhagen these require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law a functioning market economy and the acceptance of the obligations of membership including eu law evaluation of a countrys fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the european council 58 no member state has yet left the union although greenland an autonomous province of denmark withdrew in 1985 59 the lisbon treaty now contains a clause under article 50 providing for a member to leave the eu 60 on 23 june 2016 the united kingdom voted by referendum to leave the eu however it remains a member until it officially exits and has not yet begun formal withdrawal procedures 49 there are six countries that are recognised as candidates for membership albania iceland macedoniac montenegro serbia and turkey 61 though iceland suspended negotiations in 2013 62 bosnia and herzegovina and kosovo are officially recognised as potential candidates 61 with bosnia and herzegovina having submitted a membership application the four countries forming the european free trade association efta are not eu members but have partly committed to the eus economy and regulations iceland liechtenstein and norway which are a part of the single market through the european economic area and switzerland which has similar ties through bilateral treaties 63 64 the relationships of the european microstates andorra monaco san marino and the vatican include the use of the euro and other areas of co-operation 65 the following 28 sovereign states of which the map only shows territories situated in and around europe constitute the european union 66 environment in 1957 when the eec was founded it had no environmental policy 67 over the past 50 years an increasingly dense network of legislation has been created extending to all areas of environmental protection including air pollution water quality waste management nature conservation and the control of chemicals industrial hazards and biotechnology 68 according to the institute for european environmental policy environmental law comprises over 500 directives regulations and decisions making environmental policy a core area of european politics 69 european policy-makers originally increased the eus capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem 70 trade barriers and competitive distortions in the common market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state 71 in subsequent years the environment became a formal policy area with its own policy actors principles and procedures the legal basis for eu environmental policy was established with the introduction of the single european act in 1987 69 initially eu environmental policy focused on europe more recently the eu has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance eg the role of the eu in securing the ratification and coming into force of the kyoto protocol despite opposition from the united states this international dimension is reflected in the eus sixth environmental action programme 72 which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at eu level and worldwide the lisbon treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions 73 eu law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in europe as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management 69 mitigating climate change is one of the top priorities of eu environmental policy in 2007 member states agreed that in future 20 of the energy used across the eu must be renewable and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20 compared to 1990 levels 74 the eu has adopted an emissions trading system to incorporate carbon emissions into the economy 75 the european green capital is an annual award given to cities that focuses on the environment energy efficiency and quality of life in urban areas to create smart city politics the european union operates according to the principles of conferral which says that it should act only within the limits of the competences conferred on it by the treaties and of subsidiarity which says that it should act only where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting alone laws made by the eu institutions are passed in a variety of forms generally speaking they can be classified into two groups those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures regulations and those which specifically require national implementation measures directives 76 constitutional nature the classification of the eu in terms of international or constitutional law has been much debated it began life as an international organisation and gradually developed into a confederation of states however since the mid-1960s it has also added several of the key attributes of a federation such as the direct effect of the law of the general level of government upon the individual 77 and majority voting in the decision-making process of the general level of government 78 without becoming a federation per se scholars thus today see it as an intermediate form lying between a confederation and a federation being an instance of neither political structure 79 for this reason the organisation is termed sui generis incomparable one of a kind 80 although some argue that this designation is no longer valid 81 82 the organisation has traditionally used the terms community and later union to describe itself the difficulties of classification involve the difference between national law where the subjects of the law include natural persons and corporations and international law where the subjects include sovereign states and international organisations they can also be seen in the light of differing european and american constitutional traditions 81 especially in terms of the european tradition the term federation is equated with a sovereign federal state in international law so the eu cannot be called a federation  at least not without qualification it is however described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature and so it may be appropriate to consider it a federal union of states a conceptual structure lying between the confederation of states and the federal state 83 the german constitutional court refers to the eu as a staatenverbund an intermediate structure between the staatenbund confederation of states and the bundesstaat federal state consistent with this concept 84 this may be a long-lived political form professor andrew moravcsik claims that the eu is unlikely to develop further into a federal state but instead has reached maturity as a constitutional system 85 governance the european union has seven institutions the european council the council of the european union the european parliament the european commission the court of justice of the european union the european central bank and the european court of auditors competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the council of the european union and the european parliament while executive tasks are performed by the european commission and in a limited capacity by the european council not to be confused with the aforementioned council of the european union the monetary policy of the eurozone is determined by the european central bank the interpretation and the application of eu law and the treaties are ensured by the court of justice of the european union the eu budget is scrutinised by the european court of auditors there are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the eu or operate in a specific area v t e - provides impetus and direction - - legislature - - legislature - - executive - summit of the heads of state or government the president of the european council and the president of the european commission gives the necessary political impetus for the development of the union and sets its general objectives and priorities will not legislate based in brussels acts together with the parliament as a legislature shares with the parliament the budgetary power ensures coordination of the broad economic and social policy and sets out guidelines for the common foreign and security policy cfsp concludes international agreements based in brussels acts together with the council as a legislature shares with the council the budgetary power and decides in the last instance on the budget exerts the democratic control over the institutions including the european commission and approves the commission members based in and plenary sessions in strasbourg primarily meets in brussels is the executive submits proposals for new legislation to the parliament and council implements policies administers the budget ensures compliance with european law guardian of the treaties negotiates international agreements based in brussels - judiciary - - central bank - - financial auditor - ensures the uniform application and interpretation of european law has the power to decide legal disputes between member states the institutions businesses and individuals based in luxembourg forms together with the national central banks the european system of central banks and thereby determines the monetary policy of the eurozone ensures price stability in the eurozone by controlling the money supply based in frankfurt checks the proper implementation of the budget based in luxembourg european council the european council gives political direction to the eu it convenes at least four times a year and comprises the president of the european council currently donald tusk the president of the european commission and one representative per member state either its head of state or head of government the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy currently federica mogherini also takes part in its meetings it has been described by some as the unions supreme political authority 87 it is actively involved in the negotiation of treaty changes and defines the eus policy agenda and strategies the european council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies it acts externally as a collective head of state and ratifies important documents for example international agreements and treaties 88 tasks for the president of the european council are ensuring the external representation of the eu 89 driving consensus and resolving divergences among member states both during meetings of the european council and over the periods between them the european council should not be mistaken for the council of europe an international organisation independent of the eu based in strasbourg council of the european union the council of the european union also called the council 90 and the council of ministers its former title 91 forms one half of the eus legislature it consists of a government minister from each member state and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed notwithstanding its different configurations it is considered to be one single body 92 in addition to its legislative functions the council also exercises executive functions in relations to the common foreign and security policy european parliament the european parliament forms the other half of the eus legislature the 751 members of the european parliament meps are directly elected by eu citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation although meps are elected on a national basis they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality each country has a set number of seats and is divided into sub-national constituencies where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system 93 the european parliament and the council of the european union pass legislation jointly in nearly all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure this also applies to the eu budget the european commission is accountable to parliament requiring its approval to take office having to report back to it and subject to motions of censure from it the president of the european parliament currently martin schulz carries out the role of speaker in parliament and represents it externally the president and vice-presidents are elected by meps every two and a half years 94 european commission the european commission acts as the eus executive arm and is responsible for initiating legislation and the day-to-day running of the eu the commission is also seen as the motor of european integration it operates as a cabinet government with 28 commissioners for different areas of policy one from each member state though commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the eu as a whole rather than their home state one of the 28 is the president of the european commission currently jean-claude juncker appointed by the european council after the president the most prominent commissioner is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy who is ex-officio a vice-president of the commission and is also chosen by the european council 95 the other 26 commissioners are subsequently appointed by the council of the european union in agreement with the nominated president the 28 commissioners as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the european parliament budget the 2011 eu budget €141.9 bn 96 the eu had an agreed budget of €120.7billion for the year 2007 and €864.3billion for the period 2007–2013 97 representing 1.10 and 1.05 of the eu-27s gni forecast for the respective periods by comparison the united kingdoms expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be €759billion and france was estimated to have spent €801billion in 1960 the budget of the then european economic community was 0.03 of gdp 98 in the 2010 budget of €141.5billion the largest single expenditure item is cohesion  competitiveness with around 45 of the total budget 99 next comes agriculture with approximately 31 of the total 99 rural development environment and fisheries takes up around 11 99 administration accounts for around 6 99 the eu as a global partner and citizenship freedom security and justice bring up the rear with approximately 6 and 1 respectively 99 the court of auditors is legally obliged to provide the parliament and the council with a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions 100 the court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions 101 the parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the commissions handling of the budget the european court of auditors has signed off the european union accounts every year since 2007 and while making it clear that the european commission has more work to do has highlighted that most of the errors take place at national level 102 103 in their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of union expenditure agriculture and the cohesion fund were materially affected by error 104 the european commission estimated in 2009 that the financial effect of irregularities was €1,863million 105 competences eu member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the european union in some areas the eu enjoys exclusive competence these are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation in other areas the eu and its member states share the competence to legislate while both can legislate member states can only legislate to the extent to which the eu has not in other policy areas the eu can only co-ordinate support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws 106 that a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence and even with the same policy area the distribution of competences in various policy areas between member states and the union is divided in the following three categories view talk edit the customs union the establishing of the competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market monetary policy for the member states whose currency is the euro the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy common commercial policy conclusion of certain international agreements the internal market social policy for the aspects defined in this treaty economic social and territorial cohesion agriculture and fisheries excluding the conservation of marine biological resources environment consumer protection transport trans-european networks energy the area of freedom security and justice common safety concerns in public health matters for the aspects defined in this treaty research technological development andouter space development cooperation humanitarian aid coordination of economic employment and social policies common foreign security and defence policies the protection and improvement of human health industry culture tourism education youth sport and vocational training civil protection disaster prevention administrative cooperation legal system the eu is based on a series of treaties these first established the european community and the eu and then made amendments to those founding treaties 107 these are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals these legal powers include the ability to enact legislatione which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitantsf the eu has legal personality with the right to sign agreements and international treaties 108 under the principle of supremacy national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified and thus the laws enacted under them even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law and within limits even constitutional provisionsg courts of justice the judicial branch of the euformally called the court of justice of the european unionconsists of three courts the court of justice the general court and the european union civil service tribunal together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the eu 109 the court of justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states the institutions and cases referred to it by the courts of member states 110 the general court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the eus courts 111 and the european union civil service tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the european union and its civil service 112 decisions from the general court can be appealed to the court of justice but only on a point of law 113 fundamental rights the treaties declare that the eu itself is founded on the values of respect for human dignity freedom democracy equality the rule of law and respect for human rights including the rights of persons belonging to minorities in a society in which pluralism non-discrimination tolerance justice solidarity and equality between women and men prevail 114 in 2009 the lisbon treaty gave legal effect to the charter of fundamental rights of the european union the charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the eus legal acts can be judged it consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the court of justice and derived from the constitutional traditions common to the member states 115 the court of justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has on occasion invalidated eu legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights 116 although signing the european convention on human rights echr is a condition for eu membershiph previously the eu itself could not accede to the convention as it is neither a statei nor had the competence to accedej the lisbon treaty and protocol 14 to the echr have changed this the former binds the eu to accede to the convention while the latter formally permits it although the eu is independent from council of europe they share purpose and ideas especially on rule of law human rights and democracy further european convention on human rights and european social charter the source of law of charter of fundamental rights are created by council of europe the eu also promoted human rights issues in the wider world the eu opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition abolition of the death penalty is a condition for eu membership 117 acts the main legal acts of the eu come in three forms regulations directives and decisions regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force without the requirement for any implementing measuresk and automatically override conflicting domestic provisionse directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result the details of how they are to be implemented are left to member statesl when the time limit for implementing directives passes they may under certain conditions have direct effect in national law against member states decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation they are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals companies or a particular member state they are most often used in competition law or on rulings on state aid but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions regulations directives and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy 118 area of freedom security and justice since the creation of the eu in 1993 it has developed its competencies in the area of freedom security and justice initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism to this end agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions europol for co-operation of police forces 119 eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors 120 and frontex for co-operation between border control authorities 121 the eu also operates the schengen information system 17 which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities this co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the schengen agreement and the associated cross border crime furthermore the union has legislated in areas such as extradition 122 family law 123 asylum law 124 and criminal justice 125 prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treatiesm in more recent years these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race religion disability age and sexual orientationn by virtue of these powers the eu has enacted legislation on sexual discrimination in the work-place age discrimination and racial discriminationo foreign relations foreign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the community in 1957 when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the common commercial policy 126 steps for a more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of european political cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies it was not however until 1987 when european political cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the single european act epc was renamed as the common foreign and security policy cfsp by the maastricht treaty 127 the aims of the cfsp are to promote both the eus own interests and those of the international community as a whole including the furtherance of international co-operation respect for human rights democracy and the rule of law 128 the cfsp requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue the unanimity and difficult issues treated under the cfsp sometimes lead to disagreements such as those which occurred over the war in iraq 129 the coordinator and representative of the cfsp within the eu is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy who speaks on behalf of the eu in foreign policy and defence matters and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment the high representative heads up the european external action service eeas a unique eu department 130 that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 december 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon 131 the eeas will serve as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the european union 132 besides the emerging international policy of the european union the international influence of the eu is also felt through enlargement the perceived benefits of becoming a member of the eu act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the eus accession criteria and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of european formerly communist countries 133:762 this influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as soft power as opposed to military hard power 134 military the predecessors of the european union were not devised as a military alliance because nato was largely seen as appropriate and sufficient for defence purposes 135 22 eu members are members of nato 136 while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality 137 the western european union a military alliance with a mutual defence clause was disbanded in 2010 as its role had been transferred to the eu 138 according to the stockholm international peace research institute sipri the united kingdom spent $61 billion on defence in 2014 placing it fifth in the world while france spent $53 billion the sixth largest 139 together the uk and france account for approximately 40 per cent of eus defence budget and 50 per cent of its military capacity 140 both are officially recognised nuclear weapon states holding permanent seats on the united nations security council following the kosovo war in 1999 the european council agreed that the union must have the capacity for autonomous action backed by credible military forces the means to decide to use them and the readiness to do so in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by nato to that end a number of efforts were made to increase the eus military capability notably the helsinki headline goal process after much discussion the most concrete result was the eu battlegroups initiative each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500personnel 141 eu forces have been deployed on peacekeeping missions from middle and northern africa to the western balkans and western asia 142 eu military operations are supported by a number of bodies including the european defence agency european union satellite centre and the european union military staff 143 frontex is an agency of the eu established to manage the cooperation between national border guards securing its external borders it aims to detect and stop illegal immigration human trafficking and terrorist infiltration in 2015 the european commission presented its proposal for a new european border and coast guard agency having a stronger role and mandate along with national authorities for border management in an eu consisting of 28 members substantial security and defence co-operation is increasingly relying on collaboration among all member states 144 humanitarian aid the european commissions humanitarian aid and civil protection department or echo provides humanitarian aid from the eu to developing countries in 2012 its budget amounted to €874 million 51 of the budget went to africa and 20 to asia latin america the caribbean and pacific and 20 to the middle east and mediterranean 147 humanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget  70 as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the european development fund  30 148 the eus external action financing is divided into geographic instruments and thematic instruments 148 the geographic instruments provide aid through the development cooperation instrument dci €16.9 billion 2007–2013 which must spend 95 of its budget on overseas development assistance oda and from the european neighbourhood and partnership instrument enpi which contains some relevant programmes 148 the european development fund edf €22.7 bn 2008–2013 is made up of voluntary contributions by member states but there is pressure to merge the edf into the budget-financed instruments to encourage increased contributions to match the 0.7 target and allow the european parliament greater oversight 148 however five countries have reached the 0.7 target sweden luxembourg the netherlands denmark and the united kingdom 149 150 in 2011 eu aid was 0.42 of the eus gni making it the worlds most generous aid donor 151 economy the european union has established a single market across the territory of all its members representing 508 million citizens in 2014 the eu had a combined gdp of 18.640 trillion international dollars a 20 share of global gross domestic product by purchasing power parity ppp 153 as a political entity the european union is represented in the world trade organization wto eu member states own the estimated largest net wealth in the world equal to 30 of the $223 trillion global wealth 19 member states have joined a monetary union known as the eurozone which uses the euro as a single currency the currency union represents 338 million eu citizens 154 the euro is the second largest reserve currency as well as the second most traded currency in the world after the united states dollar 155 156 157 of the top 500 largest corporations in the world measured by revenue in 2010 161 have their headquarters in the eu 158 in 2016 unemployment in the eu stood at 8.9 159 while inflation was at 2.2 and the current account balance at −0.9 of gdp average annual net wage in european union was around $20,000 in 2015 it is about half of that in the united states 160 there is a significant variance for gdp ppp per capita within individual eu states the difference between the richest and poorest regions  276 nuts-2 regions of the nomenclature of territorial units for statistics ranged in 2014 from 30 of the eu28 average to 539 or from €8,200 to €148,000 about us$9,000 to us$162,000 161 structural funds and cohesion funds are supporting the development of underdeveloped regions of the eu such regions are primarily located in the states of central and southern europe 162 163 several funds provide emergency aid support for candidate members to transform their country to conform to the eus standard phare ispa and sapard and support to the commonwealth of independent states tacis tacis has now become part of the worldwide europeaid programme eu research and technological framework programmes sponsor research conducted by consortia from all eu members to work towards a single european research area 164 internal market two of the original core objectives of the european economic community were the development of a common market subsequently becoming a single market and a customs union between its member states the single market involves the free circulation of goods capital people and services within the eu 154 and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties discriminatory taxes or import quotas as they travel internally the non-eu member states of iceland norway liechtenstein and switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union 63 half the trade in the eu is covered by legislation harmonised by the eu 165 free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries 166 until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow post-maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ecj judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom the free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states the free movement of persons means that eu citizens can move freely between member states to live work study or retire in another country this required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states 167 the free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis while services account for 60–70 of gdp legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas this lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed directive on services in the internal market which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services 168 according to the treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised monetary union the creation of a european single currency became an official objective of the european economic community in 1969 in 1992 having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union the member states signed the maastricht treaty and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the convergence criteria if they wanted to join the monetary union the states wanting to participate had first to join the european exchange rate mechanism in 1999 the currency union started first as an accounting currency with eleven member states joining in 2002 the currency was fully put into place when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone which by then consisted of 12 member states the eurozone constituted by the eu member states which have adopted the euro has since grown to 19 countries 169p since its launch the euro has become the second reserve currency in the world with a quarter of foreign exchanges reserves being in euro 170 the euro and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the eu are under the control of the european central bank ecb 171 the ecb is the central bank for the eurozone and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability it is at the centre of the european system of central banks which comprehends all eu national central banks and is controlled by its general council consisting of the president of the ecb who is appointed by the european council the vice-president of the ecb and the governors of the national central banks of all 28 eu member states 172 the european system of financial supervision is an institutional architecture of the eus framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities the european banking authority the european insurance and occupational pensions authority and the european securities and markets authority to complement this framework there is also a european systemic risk board under the responsibility of the ecb the aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the eu 173 to prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union they were obliged in the maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level energy in 2006 the eu-27 had a gross inland energy consumption of 1,825million tonnes of oil equivalent toe 175 around 46 of the energy consumed was produced within the member states while 54 was imported 175 in these statistics nuclear energy is treated as primary energy produced in the eu regardless of the source of the uranium of which less than 3 is produced in the eu 176 the eu has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence this has its roots in the original european coal and steel community the introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive european energy policy was approved at the meeting of the european council in october 2005 and the first draft policy was published in january 2007 177 the eu has five key points in its energy policy increase competition in the internal market encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in central asia 178 and north africa use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing renewable energy commercialisation and finally increase funding for new energy technologies 177 the eu imports 82 of its oil 57 of its natural gas 179 and 97.48 of its uranium 176 demands because of europes dependence on russian energy the eu is attempting to diversify its energy supply 180 infrastructure the eu is working to improve cross-border infrastructure within the eu for example through the trans-european networks ten projects under ten include the channel tunnel lgv est the fréjus rail tunnel the öresund bridge the brenner base tunnel and the strait of messina bridge in 2010 the estimated network covers 75,200 kilometres  46,700mi of roads 78,000 kilometres  48,000mi of railways 330 airports 270 maritime harbours and 210 internal harbours 181 182 rail transport in europe is being synchronised with the european rail traffic management system ertms an initiative to greatly enhance safety increase efficiency of trains and enhance cross-border interoperability of rail transport in europe by replacing signalling equipment with digitised mostly wireless versions and by creating a single europe-wide standard for train control and command systems the developing european transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network in the pre-2004 eu members the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution after the recent enlargement the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda 183 the polish road network was upgraded such as the a4 autostrada 184 185 the galileo positioning system is another eu infrastructure project galileo is a proposed satellite navigation system to be built by the eu and launched by the european space agency esa the galileo project was launched partly to reduce the eus dependency on the us-operated global positioning system but also to give more complete global coverage and allow for greater accuracy given the aged nature of the gps system 186 agriculture the common agricultural policy cap is one of the long lasting policies of the european community 187 the policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production providing certainty in food supplies ensuring a high quality of life for farmers stabilising markets and ensuring reasonable prices for consumersr it was until recently operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention until the 1990s the policy accounted for over 60 of the then european communitys annual budget and as of 2013update accounts for around 34 188 the policys price controls and market interventions led to considerable overproduction these were intervention stores of products bought up by the community to maintain minimum price levels to dispose of surplus stores they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below community guaranteed prices or farmers were offered subsidies amounting to the difference between the community and world prices to export their products outside the community this system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside europe especially those in the developing world 189 supporters of cap argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living 189 since the beginning of the 1990s the cap has been subject to a series of reforms initially these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988 where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production milk quotas and more recently the de-coupling or disassociation of the money farmers receive from the eu and the amount they produce by the fischler reforms in 2004 agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce toward direct payments based on farm size this is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels 187 one of these reforms entailed the abolition of the eus sugar regime which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain african-caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the eu 190 competition the eu operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single markets the commission as the competition regulator for the single market is responsible for antitrust issues approving mergers breaking up cartels working for economic liberalisation and preventing state aid 191 the competition commissioner currently margrethe vestager is one of the most powerful positions in the commission notable for the ability to affect the commercial interests of trans-national corporations 192 for example in 2001 the commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the united states ge and honeywell which had already been approved by their national authority 193 another high-profile case against microsoft resulted in the commission fining microsoft over €777million following nine years of legal action 194 demographics as of 1 january 2016 the population of the european union is about 510.1million people 7 in 2013 5,075,000 live births were registered and 4,999,200 deaths the net migration to the eu was +653,100 in 2010 47.3 million people who lived in the eu were born outside their resident country this corresponds to 9.4 of the total eu population of these 31.4 million  6.3 were born outside the eu and 16.0 million  3.2 were born in another eu member state the largest absolute numbers of people born outside the eu were in germany  6.4 million france  5.1 million the united kingdom  4.7 million spain  4.1 million italy  3.2 million and the netherlands  1.4 million 195 urbanisation the eu contains about 40 urban areas with populations of over one million in addition to large agglomerations the eu also includes several densely populated polycentric urbanised regions that have no single core but have emerged from the connection of several cities and now encompass a large metropolis the largest of these polycentric metropolis include rhine-ruhr with approximately 11.5million inhabitants cologne dortmund düsseldorf et al randstad with approx 7million amsterdam rotterdam the hague utrecht et al frankfurt rhine-main with approx 5.8million frankfurt wiesbaden et al the flemish diamond with approx 5.5million antwerp brussels leuven ghent et al upper silesia with approx 5.3million katowice ostrava and øresund with approx 3.7million copenhagen malmö 196  v t e paris ruhrgebiet  languages survey 2012 198 native native language 199 total eu citizens able to hold a conversation in this language 200 among the many languages and dialects used in the eu it has 24 official and working languages bulgarian croatian czech danish dutch english estonian finnish french german greek hungarian italian irish latvian lithuanian maltese polish portuguese romanian slovak slovene spanish and swedish 201 202 important documents such as legislation are translated into every official language the european parliament provides translation into all languages for documents and its plenary sessions 203 some institutions use only a handful of languages as internal working languages 204 catalan galician basque scottish gaelic and welsh are not official languages of the eu but have semi-official status in that official translations of the treaties are made into them and citizens of the eu have the right to correspond with the institutions using them language policy is the responsibility of member states but eu institutions promote the learning of other languagest 205 english is the most widely spoken language in the eu being spoken by 51 of the eu population when counting both native and non-native speakers 206 german is the most widely spoken mother tongue being spoken by 16 of the eu population 56 of eu citizens are able to engage in a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue 207 most official languages of the eu belong to the indo-european language family except estonian finnish and hungarian which belong to the uralic language family and maltese which is a semitic language most eu official languages are written in the latin alphabet except bulgarian which is written in the cyrillic alphabet and greek which is written in the greek alphabet 208 these are the three official scripts of the european union 209 besides the 24 official languages there are about 150 regional and minority languages spoken by up to 50million people 208 although eu programmes can support regional and minority languages the protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the individual member states the european charter for regional or minority languages ratified by most eu states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage the european day of languages is held annually on 26 september and is aimed at encouraging language learning across europe religion self described religion in the european union  2012 210 the eu is a secular body with no formal connection to any religion the article 17 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union recognises the status under national law of churches and religious associations as well as that of philosophical and non-confessional organisations 211 the preamble to the treaty on european union mentions the cultural religious and humanist inheritance of europe 211 discussion over the draft texts of the european constitution and later the treaty of lisbon included proposals to mention christianity or god or both in the preamble of the text but the idea faced opposition and was dropped 212 christians in the eu are divided among members of catholicism both roman and eastern rite numerous protestant denominations anglicans lutherans and reformed forming the bulk of this category and the eastern orthodox church in 2009 the eu had an estimated muslim population of 13million 213 and an estimated jewish population of over a million 214 the other world religions of buddhism hinduism and sikhism are also represented in the eu population according to new polls about religiosity in the european union in 2012 by eurobarometer christianity is the largest religion in the european union accounting for 72 of the eu population 210 catholics are the largest christian group accounting for 48 of the eu population while protestants make up 12 eastern orthodox make up 8 and other christians make up 4 215 eurostats eurobarometer opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52 of eu citizens believed in a god 27 in some sort of spirit or life force and 18 had no form of belief 216 many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years 217 the countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were estonia  16 and the czech republic  19 216 the most religious countries were malta  95 predominantly roman catholic as well as cyprus and romania both predominantly orthodox each with about 90 of citizens professing a belief in god across the eu belief was higher among women older people those with religious upbringing those who left school at 15 or 16 and those positioning themselves on the right of the political scale 216 education and science basic education is an area where the eus role is limited to supporting national governments in higher education the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility the most visible of these has been the erasmus programme a university exchange programme which began in 1987 in its first 20years it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5million university and college students and has become a symbol of european student life 218 there are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers for trainees in vocational education and training and for adult learners in the lifelong learning programme 2007–2013 these programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the eu 219 220 through its support of the bologna process the eu is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across europe scientific development is facilitated through the eus framework programmes the first of which started in 1984 the aims of eu policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research the independent european research council allocates eu funds to european or national research projects 221 eu research and technological framework programmes deal in a number of areas for example energy where the aim is to develop a diverse mix of renewable energy to help the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels 222 health care although the eu has no major competences in the field of health care article 35 of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union affirms that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all union policies and activities the european commissions directorate-general for health and consumers seeks to align national laws on the protection of peoples health on the consumers rights on the safety of food and other products 223 224 225 health care in the eu is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level the systems are primarily publicly funded through taxation universal health care private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non-taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private non-subsidised health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurancecitation needed all eu and many other european countries offer their citizens a free european health insurance card which on a reciprocal basis provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating european countries 226 a directive on cross-border healthcare aims at promoting co-operation on health care between member states and facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare for european patients 227 228 229 culture cultural co-operation between member states has been a concern of the eu since its inclusion as a community competency in the maastricht treaty 230 actions taken in the cultural area by the eu include the culture 2000 seven-year programme 230 the european cultural month event 231 and orchestras such as the european union youth orchestra 232 the european capital of culture programme selects one or more cities in every year to assist the cultural development of that city 233 53 eu cities have been part of this initiative up to 2016 sport sport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations rather than of the eu however there are some eu policies that have affected sport such as the free movement of workers which was at the core of the bosman ruling that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with european citizenship 234 the treaty of lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity 235 this followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the international olympic committee and fifa due to objections over the application of free market principles to sport which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs 236 the eu does fund a programme for israeli jordanian irish and british football coaches as part of the football 4 peace project 237 association football is the most popular sport in almost all eu countries and their club teams are amongst the richest and most popular worldwide other team sports like rugby ice hockey basketball cricket handball volleyball and water polo are also popular in some member states symbols the flag of the union consists of a circle of 12 golden stars on a blue background the blue represents the west while the number and position of the stars represent completeness and unity respectively 238 originally designed in 1955 for the council of europe the flag was adopted by the european communities the predecessors of the present union in 1986 united in diversity was adopted as the motto of the union in the year 2000 having been selected from proposals submitted by school pupils 239 since 1985 the flag day of the union has been europe day on 9 may the date of the 1950 schuman declaration the anthem of the union is an instrumental version of the prelude to the ode to joy the 4th movement of ludwig van beethovens ninth symphony the anthem was adopted by european community leaders in 1985 and has since been played on official occasions 240 besides naming the continent the greek mythological figure of europa has frequently been employed as a personification of europe known from the myth in which zeus seduces her in the guise of a white bull europa has also been referred to in relation to the present union statues of europa and the bull decorate several of the unions institutions and a portrait of her is seen on the 2013 series of euro banknotes the bull is for its part depicted on all residence permit cards 241 charles the great also known as charlemagne latin carolus magnus and later recognised as pater europae father of europe 242 243 244 245 246 has a symbolic relevance to europe the commission has named one of its central buildings in brussels after charlemagne and the city of aachen has since 1949 awarded the charlemagne prize to champions of european unification 247 since 2008 the organisers of this prize in conjunction with the european parliament have awarded the charlemagne youth prize in recognition of similar efforts by young people 248 media media freedom is a fundamental right that applies to all member states of the european union and its citizens as defined in the eu charter of fundamental rights as well as the european convention on human rights 249:1 within the eu enlargement process guaranteeing media freedom is named a key indicator of a countrys readiness to become part of the eu 250 the media programme of the european union intends to support the european popular film and audiovisual industries since 1991 it provides support for the development promotion and distribution of european works within europe and beyond 251 arte is a public franco-german tv network a european channel launched in 1992 that promotes programming in the areas of culture and the arts created the following year euronews aims to cover world news from a pan-european perspective and is broatcasted in 13 languages including 8 official in the eu see also outline of the european union
