that therefore has a minimal output of greenhouse gas ghg emissions into the biosphere but specifically refers to the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ghg emissions due to anthropogenic human activity are the dominant cause of observed global warming climate change since the mid-20th century 3 continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes around the world increasing the likelihood of severe pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems 4 many countries around the world are designing and implementing low emission development strategies leds these strategies seek to achieve social economic and environmental development goals while reducing long-term greenhouse gas emissions and increasing resilience to climate change impacts 5 globally implemented low-carbon economies are therefore proposed by those having drawn this conclusion as a means to avoid catastrophic climate change and as a precursor to the more advanced

and aimsedit nations may seek to become low-carbon or decarbonised economies as a part of a national climate change mitigation strategy a comprehensive strategy to mitigate climate change is through carbon neutrality the aim of a lce is to integrate all aspects of itself from its manufacturing agriculture transportation and power-generation etc around technologies that produce energy and materials with little ghg emission and thus around populations buildings machines and devices that use those energies and materials efficiently and dispose of or recycle its wastes so as to have a minimal output of ghgs furthermore it has been proposed that to make the transition to an lce economically viable we would have to attribute a cost per unit output to ghgs through means such as emissions trading andor a carbon tax some nations are presently low carbon societies that are not heavily industrialised or populated in order to avoid climate change on a global level all nations considered carbon intensive societies and societies that are heavily populated might have to become zero-carbon societies and economies several of these countriescitation needed have pledged to cut their emissions by 100 via offsetting emissions rather than ceasing all emissions carbon neutrality in other words emitting will not cease but will continue and will be offset to a different geographical area eu emission trading system allows companies to buy international carbon credits thus the companies can channel clean technologies to promote other countries to adopt low-carbon developments 6 benefits of low-carbon economiesedit low-carbon economies present multiple benefits to ecosystem resilience trade employment health energy security industrial competitiveness and gender equality 7 benefits to ecosystem resilienceedit low emission development strategies for the land use sector can prioritize the protection of carbon rich ecosystems to not only reduce emissions but also to protect biodiversity and safeguard local livelihoods to reduce rural poverty - all of which can lead to more climate resilient systems according to a report by the low emission development strategies global partnership leds gp redd and blue carbon initiatives are among the measures available to conserve sustainably manage and restore these carbon rich ecosystems which are crucial for natural carbon storage and sequestration and for building climate resilient communities 8 job creationedit transitioning to a low-carbon environmentally and socially sustainable economies can become a strong driver of job creation job upgrading social justice and poverty eradication if properly managed with the full engagement of governments workers and employers organizations 9 estimates from the international labour organizations global economic linkages model suggest that unmitigated climate change with associated negative impacts on enterprises and workers will have negative effects on output in many industries with drops in output of 2.4 by 2030 and 7.2 by 2050  10 transitioning to a low-carbon economy will cause shifts in the volume composition and quality of employment across sectors and will affect the level and distribution of income research indicates that eight sectors employing around 1.5 billion workers approximately half the global workforce will undergo major changes agriculture forestry fishing energy resource intensive manufacturing recycling buildings and transport 11 gender equalityedit countries can tap into hidden potential and make their transition to low carbon societies truly sustainable by actively engaging both women and men in all segments of society women often play a central role in sectors where emissions can be substantially reduced in tandem with development benefits this includes efficient household energy use supporting activities that generate income and shaping consumption patterns towards low emission products in addition identifying women as active members of society and promoting their participation in newnontraditional climate related job opportunities for example as renewable energy technicians and entrepreneurs will contribute to poverty reduction and economic growth 12 business competitivenessedit low emission industrial development and resource efficiency can offer many opportunities to increase the competitiveness of economies and companies according to the low emission development strategies global partnership leds gp there is often a clear business case for switching to lower emission technologies with payback periods ranging largely from 0.5â€“5 years leveraging financial investment 13 improved trade policyedit trade and trade policies can contribute to low-carbon economies by enabling more efficient use of resources and international exchange of climate friendly goods and services removing tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade in clean energy and energy efficiency technologies is one such measure in a sector where finished products consist of many components that cross borders numerous times - a typical wind turbine for example contains up to 8,000 components - even small tariff cuts would reduce costs this would make the technologies more affordable and competitive in the global market particularly when combined with a phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies 14 energy policyedit renewable energy and energy efficiencyedit recent advances in technology and policy will allow renewable energy and energy efficiency to play major roles in displacing fossil fuels meeting global energy demand while reducing carbon dioxide emissions renewable energy technologies are being rapidly commercialized and in conjunction with efficiency gains can achieve far greater emissions reductions than either could independently 15 renewable energy is energy that comes from natural resources such as sunlight wind rain tides and geothermal heat which are renewable naturally replenished in 2008 about 19 of global final energy consumption came from renewables 16 during the five years from the end of 2004 through 2009 worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10â€“60 percent annually for many technologies for wind power and many other renewable technologies growth accelerated in 2009 relative to the previous four years 17 more wind power capacity was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology however grid-connected photovoltaics increased the fastest of all renewables technologies with a 60 percent annual average growth rate for the five-year period 17 energy for power heat cooling and mobility is the key ingredient for development and growth with energy security a prerequisite economic growth making it arguably the most important driver for energy policy scaling up renewable energy as part of a low emission development strategy can diversify a countrys energy mixes and reduces dependence on imports it can also lower geopolitical risks and exposure to fuel price volatility and improve the balance of trade for importing countries noting that only a handful of countries export oil and gas renewable energy offers lower financial and economic risk for businesses through a more stable and predictable cost base for energy supply 18 energy efficiency gains in recent decades have been significant but there is still much more that can be achieved with a concerted effort and strong policies in place future energy efficiency improvements are likely to be very large heat is one of many forms of energy wastage that could be captured to significantly increase useful energy without burning more fossil fuels 15 sustainable biofuelsedit biofuels in the form of liquid fuels derived from plant materials are entering the market driven by factors such as oil price spikes and the need for increased energy security however many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the natural environment food security and land use 19 20 the challenge is to support biofuel development including the development of new cellulosic technologies with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is sustainable responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in africa latin america and asia 19 20 21 biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a silver bullet to deal with transport emissions however they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation a healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on fossil fuels especially in the transport sector 20 using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a sustainable transport strategy nuclear poweredit nuclear power has been offered as the primary means to achieve a lce in terms of large industrialized nations mainland france due primarily to 75 of its electricity being produced by nuclear power has the lowest carbon dioxide production per unit of gdp in the world and it is the largest exporter of electricity in the world earning it approximately â‚¬3 billion annually in sales 22 concern is often expressed with the matter of spent nuclear fuel storage and security although the physical issues are not large the political difficulties are significant the liquid fluoride thorium reactor lftr has been suggested as a solution to the concerns posed by conventional nuclear 23 france reprocesses their spent nuclear fuel at the la hague site since 1976 and has also treated spent nuclear fuel from france japan germany belgium switzerland italy spain and the netherlands smart gridedit one proposal from karlsruhe university 24 25 developed as a virtual power station is the use of solar and wind energy for base load with hydro and biogas for make up or peak load hydro and biogas are used as energy storage this requires the development of a smart intelligent grid hopefully including local power networks than use energy near the site of production thereby minimising electrical grid losses methane cycleedit a further development of this is the use of the carbon capture hydrogen and its conversion into methane sng synthetic natural gas to act as a storage for intermittent renewables 26 co2  4h2  ch4  2h2o sabatier reaction this involves the use of the existing natural gas methane grid as the store in this case the carbon dioxide is given economic value as a component of energy carrier this solar fuel 27 cycle uses the excess electrical renewable energy that cannot be used instantaneously in the grid which otherwise would be wasted to create hydrogen via electrolysis of water the hydrogen is then combined with co2 to create synthetic or substitute natural gas sng and stored in the natural gas network the natural gas is used to create electrical energy and the heat used as well in chp on demand when there is not enough sun photovoltaic csp or wind turbines or water hydro ocean current waves the german natural gas grid for example has two months of storage more than enough to outlast renewable energy low production points ccsedit the proposed strategy of carbon capture and storage ccs - continued use of non-renewable fossil fuels but without allowing carbon dioxide to reach the atmosphere - has also been considered as a means to achieve a lce either in a primary or supporting role major concerns include the uncertainty of costs and time needed to successfully implement ccs worldwide and with guarantees that stored emissions will not leak into the biosphere combined heat and poweredit combined heat and power chp is a technology which by allowing the more efficient use of fuel will at least reduce carbon emissions should the fuel be biomass or biogas or hydrogen used as an energy store then in principle it can be a zero carbon option chp can also be used with a nuclear reactor as the energy source there are examples of such installations in the far north of the russian federation primary sectoredit agricultureedit most of the agricultural facilities in the developed world are mechanized due to rural electrification rural electrification has produced significant productivity gains but it also uses a lot of energy for this and other reasons such as transport costs in a low-carbon society rural areas would need available supplies of renewably produced electricitycitation needed irrigation can be one of the main components of an agricultural facilitys energy consumption in parts of california it can be up to 90 28 in the low carbon economy irrigation equipment will be maintained and continuously updated and farms will use less irrigation water cropsedit different crops require different amounts of energy input for example glasshouse crops irrigated crops and orchards require a lot of energy to maintain while row crops and field crops do not need as much maintenance those glasshouse and irrigated crops that do exist will incorporate the following improvements 29 glasshouse crops environmental control systems heat recovery using condensers heat storage using buffer tanks heat retention using thermal screens alternative fuels eg waste wood and trees cogeneration heat and power irrigated arable crops soil moisture measurement to regulate irrigation variable-speed drives on pumps livestockedit livestock operations can also use a lot of energy depending on how they are run feed lots use animal feed made from corn soybeans and other crops energy must be expended to produce these crops process and transport them free-range animals find their own vegetation to feed on the farmer may expend energy to take care of that vegetation but not nearly as much as the farmer growing cereal and oil-seed crops many livestock operations currently use a lot of energy to water their livestock in the low-carbon economy such operations will use more water conservation methods such as rainwater collection water cisterns etc and they will also pumpdistribute that water with on-site renewable energy sources most likely wind and solar due to rural electrification most agricultural facilities in the developed world use a lot of electricity in a low-carbon economy farms will be run and equipped to allow for greater energy efficiency the dairy industry for example will incorporate the following changes 29 irrigated dairy heat recovery on milk vats variable speed drives on motorspumps heat recovery from hot water wash soil moisture measurement to regulate irrigation biodigester with cogen heat  power vat wrap solar water heating ripple control ice bank chemical substitute for hot-water wash hunting and fishingedit fishing is quite energy intensive improvements such as heat recovery on refrigeration and trawl net technology will be common in the low-carbon economy 29dead link forestryedit protecting forests provides integrated benefits to all ranging from increased food production safeguarded local livelihoods protected biodiversity and ecosystems provided by forests and reduced rural poverty adopting low emission strategies for both agricultural and forest production also mitigates some of the effects of climate change 30 in the low-carbon economy forestry operations will be focused on low-impact practices and regrowth forest managers will make sure that they do not disturb soil-based carbon reserves too much specialized tree farms will be the main source of material for many products quick maturing tree varieties will be grown on short rotations in order to maximize output 31 miningedit flaring and venting of natural gas in oil wells is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions its contribution to greenhouse gases has declined by three-quarters in absolute terms since a peak in the 1970s of approximately 110 million metric tonsyear and in 2004 accounted for about 1/2 of one percent of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions 32 the world bank estimates that 134 billion cubic meters of natural gas are flared or vented annually  2010 datum an amount equivalent to the combined annual gas consumption of germany and france or enough to supply the entire world with gas for 16 days this flaring is highly concentrated 10 countries account for 70 of emissions and twenty for 85 33 the top-ten leading contributors to world gas flaring in 2010 were in declining order russia  26 nigeria  11 iran  8 iraq  7 algeria  4 angola  3 kazakhstan  3 libya  3 saudi arabia  3 and venezuela  2 34 secondary sectoredit basic metals processingedit high

high-efficiency lighting such as compact fluorescent halogen and eventually led light sources many retail stores will also feature roof-top solar panel arrays these make sense because solar panels produce the most energy during the daytime and during the summer these are the same times that electricity is the most expensive and also the same times that stores use the most electricity 35 transportation servicesedit sustainable low-carbon transport systems are based on minimizing travel and shifting to more environmentally as well as socially and economically sustainable mobility improving transport technologies fuels and institutions 36 decarbonisation of urban mobility by means of more energy efficiency and alternative propulsion increased focus on fuel efficient vehicle shapes and configurations with more vehicle electrification particularly through plug-in hybrids more alternative and flex-fuel vehicles based on local conditions and availability driver training for more fuel efficiency low-carbon biofuels cellulosic biodiesel bioethanol biobutanol petroleum fuel surcharges will be a more significant part of consumer costs less international trade of physical objects despite more overall trade as measure by value of goods greater use of marine and electric rail transport less use of air and truck transport increased non-motorised transport ie walking and cycling and public transport usage less reliance on private motor vehicles more pipeline capacity for common fluid commodities such as water ethanol butanol natural gas petroleum and hydrogen in addition to gasoline and diesel see 37 38 39 increased focus on fuel efficient vehicle shapes and configurations with more vehicle electrification particularly through plug-in hybrids more alternative and flex-fuel vehicles based on local conditions and availability driver training for more fuel efficiency low-carbon biofuels cellulosic biodiesel bioethanol biobutanol petroleum fuel surcharges will be a more significant part of consumer costs sustainable transport has many co-benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development according to a series of reports by the low emission development strategies global partnership leds gp low carbon transport can help create jobs 40 improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways 41 make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient it also offers a practical opportunity to save peoples time and household income as well as government budgets 42 making investment in sustainable transport a win-win opportunity health servicesedit there have been some moves to investigate the ways and extent to which health systems contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and how they may need to change to become part of a low-carbon world the sustainable development unit 43 of the nhs in the uk is one of the first official bodies to have been set up in this area whilst organisations such as the campaign for greener healthcare 44 are also producing influential changes at a clinical level this work includes quantification of where the health services emissions stem from information on the environmental impacts of alternative models of treatment and service provision some of the suggested changes needed are greater efficiency and lower ecological impact of energy buildings and procurement choices eg in-patient meals pharmaceuticals and medical equipment a shift from focusing solely on cure to prevention through the promotion of healthier lower-carbon lifestyles eg diets lower in red meat and dairy products walking or cycling wherever possible better town planning to encourage more outdoor lifestyles improving public transport and liftsharing options for transport to and from hospitals and clinics initial stepsedit a good overview of the history of international efforts towards a low-carbon economy from its initial seed at the inaugural un conference on the human environment in stockholm in 1972 has been given by david runnals 45 on the international scene the most prominent early step in the direction of a low-carbon economy was the signing of the kyoto protocol which came into force on february 16 2005 under which most industrialized countries committed to reduce their carbon emissions 46 47 importantly all member nations of the organization for economic co-operation and development except the united states have ratified the protocol europe is the leading geopolitical continent in defining and mobilising decarbonisation policies 48 for instance the uitp - an organisation advocating sustainable mobility and public transport - has an eu office but less well developed contacts with for example the us the european union committee of the uitp wants to promote decarbonisation of urban mobility in europe 49 although europe is nowadays the leading geopolitical continent with regard to lowering emissions europe is quickly losing ground to asia with countries such as china and south korea 50 however the 2014 global green economy index ggei  51 ranks 60 nations on their green economic performance finding that the nordic countries and switzerland have the best combined performance around climate change and green economy countriesedit australiaedit australia has implemented schemes to start the transition to a low-carbon economy but carbon neutrality has not been mentioned and since the introduction of the schemes emissions have increased the second rudd government pledged to lower emissions by 5-15 in 2001 the howard government introduced a mandatory renewable energy target mret scheme in 2007 the government revised the mret - 20 percent of australias electricity supply to come from renewable energy sources by 2020 renewable energy sources provide 8-10 of the nations energy and this figure will increase significantly in the coming years however coal dependence and exporting conflicts with the concept of australia as a low-carbon economy carbon-neutral businesses have received no incentive they have voluntarily done so carbon-offset companies offer assessments based on lifecycle impacts to businesses that seek carbon neutrality the carbon reduction institute 52 is one such offset provider that has produced a certification procedure to promote a low-carbon economy in australia though the only true certified carbon neutral scheme is the australian governments national carbon offset standard ncos three of the four of australias top banks are now certified under this scheme and full list of compliant companies can be seen here httpwwwenvironmentgovauclimate-changecarbon-neutralcarbon-neutral-programaccredited-businessescertifiedorganisations  businesses are now moving from unaccredited schemes such as noco2 and transitioning to ncos as the only one that is externally audited most of leading carbon management companies have also aligned with ncos such as net balance

gillard government introduced a price on carbon dioxide emissions for businesses although often characterised as a tax it lacked the revenue-raising nature of a true tax in 2013 on the election of the abbott government immediate legislative steps were taken to repeal the so-called carbon tax the price on carbon was repealed on the 17th july 2014 by an act of parliament as it stands australia currently has no mechanism to deal with climate change chinaedit in china the city of dongtan is to be built to produce zero net greenhouse gas emissions 53 the chinese state council announced in 2009 it aimed to cut chinas carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gdp by 40-45 in 2020 from 2005 levels 54 however carbon dioxide emissions were still increasing by 10 a year by 2013 and china was emitting more carbon dioxide than the next two biggest countries combined usa and india 55 total carbon dioxide emissions were projected to increase until 2030 56 costa ricaedit costa rica sources much of its energy needs from renewables and is undertaking reforestation projects in 2007 the costa rican government announced the commitment for costa rica to become the first carbon neutral country by 2021 57 58 59 icelandedit iceland began utilising renewable energy early in the 20th century and so since has been a low-carbon economy however since dramatic economic growth icelands emissions have increased significantly per capita as of 2009 iceland energy is sourced from mostly geothermal energy and hydropower renewable energy in iceland and since 1999 has provided over 70 of the nations primary energy and 99.9 of icelands electricity 60 as a result of this icelands carbon emissions per capita are 62 lower than those of the united states 61 despite using more primary energy per capita 62 due to the fact that it is renewable and low-cost iceland seeks carbon neutrality and expects to use 100 renewable energy by 2050 by generating hydrogen fuel from renewable energy sources indiaedit low carbon

are extremely vulnerable to climate change several mountain glaciers have already begun to retreat leading to water scarcity in some areas peru brought in a national strategy on climate change in 2003 it is a detailed accounting of 11 strategic focuses that prioritize scientific research mitigation of climate change effects on the poor and creating clean development mechanism cdm mitigation and adaptation policies 65 in 2010 the peruvian ministry of environment published a plan of action for adaptation and mitigation of climate change 66 the plan categorises existing and future programmes into seven action groups including reporting mechanisms on ghg emissions mitigation adaptation research and development of technology of systems financing and management and public education it also contains detailed budget information and analysis relating to climate change in 2014 peru hosted the twentieth conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc cop20 negotiations 67 at the same time peru enacted a new climate law which provides for the creation of a national greenhouse gas inventory system called infocarbono 68 according to the low emission development strategies global partnership leds gp infocarbono is a major transformation of the countrys greenhouse gas management system previously the system was under the sole control of the peruvian ministry of the environment the new framework makes each relevant ministry responsible for their own share of greenhouse gas management united kingdomedit in the united kingdom the climate change act 2008 outlining a framework for the transition to a low-carbon economy became law on november 26 2008 this legislation requires an 80 cut in the uks carbon emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels with an intermediate target of between 26 and 32 by 2020 69 thus the uk became the first country to set such a long-range and significant carbon reduction target into law a meeting at the royal society on 17â€“18 november 2008 concluded that an integrated approach making best use of all available technologies is required to move toward a low-carbon future it was suggested by participants that it would be possible to move to a low-carbon economy within a few decades but that urgent and sustained action is needed on several fronts 70 in june 2012 the uk coalition government announced the introduction of mandatory carbon reporting requiring around 1,100 of the uks largest listed companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions every year deputy prime minister nick clegg confirmed that emission reporting rules would come into effect from april 2013 in his piece for the guardian 71 in july 2014 the uk energy savings opportunity scheme esos came into force 72 this requires all large businesses in the uk to undertake mandatory assessments looking at energy use and energy efficiency opportunities at least once every four years 73 the low carbon economy has been described as a uk success story accounting for more than Â£120 billion in annual sales and employing almost 1 million people a 2013 report suggests that over a third of the uks economic growth in
