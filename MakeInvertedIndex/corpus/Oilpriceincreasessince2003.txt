world oil market chronology from 2003 from the mid-1980s to september 2003 the inflation adjusted price of a barrel of crude oil on nymex was generally under $25barrel then during 2004 the price rose above $40 and then $50 a series of events led the price to exceed $60 by august 11 2005 leading to a record-speed hike that reached $75 by the middle of 2006 prices then dropped back to $60barrel by the early part of 2007 before rising steeply again to $92barrel by october 2007 and $99.29barrel for december futures in new york on november 21 2007 1 throughout the first half of 2008 oil regularly

10 then in 2009 prices went slightly higher although not to the extent of the 2005-2007 crisis exceeding $100 in 2011 and most of 2012 since late 2013 the oil price has fallen below the $100 mark plummeting below the $50 mark one year later as the price of producing petroleum did not rise significantly the price increases have coincided with a period of record profits for the oil industrycitation needed between 2004 and 2007 the profits of the six supermajors - exxonmobil total shell bp chevron and conocophillips - totaled $494.8 billion 11 likewise major oil-dependent countries such as saudi arabia the united arab emirates canada russia venezuela and nigeria have benefited economically from surging oil prices during the 2000s  contents 1 2003 2 2004 to 2008 rising

averaged $30 a barrel in 2003 due to political instability within various oil producing nations it rose 19 from the average in 2002 12 the 2003 invasion of iraq marked a significant event for oil markets because iraq contains a large amount of global oil reserves 13 the conflict coincided with an increase in global demand for petroleum but it also reduced iraqs current oil production and has been blamed for increasing oil prices 14 however oil company ceo matthew simmons emphasizes the peaking and decline of oil-exporting in mexico indonesia and the united kingdom is the reason for the price gouging according to simmons 15 isolated events such as the iraq war affect short-term prices but do not determine a long-term trend simmons cites the use of enhanced oil recovery techniques in large fields such as mexicos cantarell 15 which maintained production for a few years until it eventually declined pumping oil out of iraq may reduce petroleum prices in the short term but will be unable to perpetually lower the price from simmons point of view the invasion of iraq is associated with the start of long-term increase in oil prices but it may mitigate the decline in oil production by retaining a partial amount of iraqs oil reserves as a direct consequence the oil production capacity was diminished to 2 million barrels  320,000m3 per day 16 2004 to 2008 rising costs of oiledit after retreating for several months in late 2004 and early 2005 crude oil prices rose to new highs in march 2005 the price on nymex has been above $50 per barrel since march 5 2005 in june 2005 crude oil prices broke the psychological barrier of $60 per barrel from 2005 onwards the price elasticity of the crude oil market changed significantly before 2005 a small increase in oil price lead to an noticeable expansion of the production volume later price rises let the production grow only by small numbers this was the reason to call 2005 a tipping point 17 after the destruction of hurricane katrina in the united states gasoline prices reached a record high during the first week of september 2005 the average retail price was on average $3.04 per us gallon 18 the average retail price of a liter of petrol in the united kingdom was 86.4p on october 19 2006 or $6.13 per gallon 19 oil production in iraq continued to decline as result of the nations ongoing conflict causing a decrease in production to 1 million barrels per day  160,000m3d 20 in mid-2006 crude oil was traded for over usd 79 per barrel bbl 21 setting an all-time record the run-up is attributed to a 1.9 increase in gasoline consumption geopolitical tensions resulting from north koreas missile launch the ongoing iraq war as well as israel and lebanon going to war are also causative factors the higher price of oil substantially cut growth of world oil demand in 2006 including a reduction in oil demand of the oecd 22 after news of north koreas successful nuclear test on october 9 2006 oil prices rose past $60 a barrel but fell back the next day on october 19 2007 us light crude rose to $90.02 per barrel due to a combination of ongoing tensions in eastern turkey and the reducing strength of the us dollar 23

the smallest amount permitted and immediately sold it for $99.40 at a $600 loss 25 oil fell back later in the week to $97.91 at the close of trading on friday january 4 in part due to a weak jobs report that showed unemployment had risen 26 on march 5 2008 opec accused the united states of economic mismanagement that was pushing oil prices to record highs rebuffing calls to boost output and

hours the largest gain in history due to the possibility of an israeli attack on iran 32 the combination of two major oil suppliers reducing supply generated fears of a repeat of the 1973 oil crisis

markets were saturated 33 and a saudi promise of increased production would not lower prices 34 several asian refineries were refusing saudi petroleum in late june because they were over priced grade

weeks from $88 to $70 mainly due to concerns over how european countries would reduce budget deficits if the european economy slowed down this would mean less demand for crude oil also if the european economic crisis caused the american economy to have problems demand for oil would be reduced further 50 other factors included the strong dollar and high inventories according to the us energy information administration gas prices nationwide averaged $2.91 on may 10 dropping to $2.79 two weeks later the deepwater horizon oil spill was not a factor in gas prices since the well had not produced 51 prices rose back to $90barrel in december 2010 52 the us average for a gallon of 87 octane regular unleaded averaged $3.00gallon on december 23 sparking fear of a second recession if

topped at $103 on february 24 where oil production is curtailed to the political upheaval in libya 53 oil supplies remained high and saudi arabia assured an increase in production to counteract shutdowns still the mideast and north african crisis led to a rise in oil prices to the highest level in two years with gasoline prices following though most libyan oil went to europe all oil prices reacted the average price of gasoline in the united states increased 6 cents to $3.17 54 on march 1 2011 a significant drop in libyan production and fears of more instability in other countries pushed the price of oil over $100 a barrel in new york trading while the average price of gas reached $3.37 despite saudi promises the sour type oil the country exported could not replace the more desirable sweet libyan oil 55 on march 7 2011 the average price of gas having reached $3.57 individuals were making changes in their driving 56 the weakened us dollar resulted in a spike to $112barrel with the national average of $3.74gallon - with expectations of damaging the us economy suggestive of a long-term recession 57 as of april 26 the national average was $3.87 - with a fear of $4gallon as the

had risen to $94.96 almost $5 above the lowest point reached after the previous weeks action one reason was the falling dollar as greece appeared less likely to default on its debt concern over the greek debt crisis had caused falling oil prices 65 66 after another week oil for august delivery had risen from $90.61 to $98.67 and gas prices were up five cents increased worldwide demand was one reason 67 brent crude remained high at $118.38 partly due to supply problems in europe including lower north sea production and the continuing war in libya 68 on august 4 the price of oil dropped 6 percent to its lowest level in 6 months on august 5 the price had dropped $8.82 in a week to $86.88 per barrel on the new york mercantile exchange the same pessimistic economic news that caused stock

stayed near $100 throughout january because of concerns over supplies and the european debt situation the average price of gas was $3.38 on january 20 up 17 cents from a month earlier 73 74 another

demand was the lowest since september 2001 76 on february 20 benchmark march crude oil reached $105.21 the highest in nine months this came one day after irans oil ministry announced an end to sales
