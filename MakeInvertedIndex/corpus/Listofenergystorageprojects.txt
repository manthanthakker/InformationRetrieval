list of energy storage projects this is a list of energy storage projects worldwide many individual energy storage projects augment electrical grids by capturing excess electrical energy during periods of low demand and storing it in other forms until needed on an electrical grid the energy is later converted back to its electrical form and returned to the grid as needed another energy storage method is the consumption of surplus or low-cost energy typically during night time for conversion into resources such as hot water cool water or ice which is then used for heating or cooling at other times when electricity is in higher demand and at greater cost per kilowatt hour kwh such thermal energy storage is often employed at end-user sites such as large buildings and also as part of district heating thus shifting energy consumption to other times for better balancing of supply and demand some notable energy storage projects include sir adam beck hydroelectric generating stations bear swamp hydroelectric power station seneca pumped storage generating station salina pumped storage project carters dam smith mountain dam and matanoagawa dam  contents 1 system types 1.1 forms of energy storage 2 projects and sites 2.1 listing 3 see also 4 references 5 external links 1.1 forms of energy storage 2.1 listing  system typesedit forms of energy storageedit mechanical compressed air energy storage flywheel energy storage gravitational potential energy storage pumped hydroelectric storage phs or pumped storage hydropower psh see pumped-storage hydroelectricity thermal cool water hot water or ice thermal storage see thermal energy storage and seasonal thermal energy storage liquid air or liquid nitrogen energy storage see cryogenic energy storage molten salt storage chemical battery battery energy storage system bess flow battery secondary battery see rechargeable battery hydrogen storage power to gas electromagnetic storage coil superconducting storage coil see superconducting magnetic energy storage projects and sitesedit listingedit see alsoedit distributed generation energy energy density energy reduction assets energy storage challenge grid energy storage hybrid renewable energy system list of concentrating solar thermal power companies list of energy topics list of geothermal power stations list of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations list of solar thermal power stations lists of wind farms by country power transmission pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations category us doe international energy storage database referencesedit external linksedit us dept of energy - energy storage systems us dept of energy - energy storage systems database the worlds pumped storage plants stations de pompage turbinage dans le monde v t e list of onshore wind farms list of onshore wind farms in the united kingdom list of offshore wind farms in the united kingdom list of offshore wind farms in the united states lists of offshore wind farms by country lists of offshore wind farms by water area lists of wind farms by country list of wind farms in australia list of wind farms in canada list of wind farms in iran list of wind farms in romania list of wind farms in sweden list of wind farms in the united states index of solar energy articles list of books about renewable energy list of concentrating solar thermal power companies list of countries by electricity production from renewable sources list of energy storage projects list of geothermal power stations lists of hydroelectric power stations list of largest hydroelectric power stations list of people associated with renewable energy list of photovoltaics companies list of photovoltaic power stations list of pioneering solar buildings
