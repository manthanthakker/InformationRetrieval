energy conservation measure an energy conservation measure ecm is any type of project conducted or technology implemented to reduce the consumption of energy in a building the types of projects implemented can be in a variety of forms but usually are designed to reduce utility costs water electricity and gas being the main three for industrial and commercial enterprises the aim of an ecm should be to achieve a savings reducing the amount of energy used by a particular process technology or facility energy conservation measures are often combined into larger guaranteed energy savings performance contracts to maximize energy savings while minimizing disruption to building occupants by coordinating renovations some ecms cost less to implement yet return a higher energy savings traditionally lighting projects were a good example of low hanging fruit 1 that could be used to drive implementation of more substantial upgrades to hvac systems in large facilities smaller buildings might combine window replacement with modern insulation using advanced building foams to improve energy performance energy dashboard projects 2 are a new kind of ecm which relies on the behavioral change of building occupants to save energy when implemented as part of a program case studies such as that for the dc schools report energy savings up 30 3 under the right circumstances open energy dashboards can even be implemented for free 4 to improve upon these savings even more on a global basis energy efficiency works behind the scenes to improve our energy security lower our energy bills and move us closer to reaching our climate goals according to the iea some 40 of the global energy efficiency market is financed with debt and equity 5 energy performance investment are one financing mechanism by which ecms can be implemented now and paid for by the savings realized over the life of the project while all 50 states puerto rico and washington dc have statutes allowing companies to offer energy savings performance contracts success varies because of variations in the approach the states degree of involvement and other factors 6 7 homes and businesses are implementing energy-efficiency measures that include low-energy lighting insulation and even high tech energy dashboards to cut bills by avoiding waste and boosting productivity businesses implementing ecms in their commercial buildings often employ energy service companies escos experienced in energy performance contracting  this industry has been around since the 1970s and is more prevalent than ever today the us-based organization evo efficiency valuation organization 8 has created a set of guidelines for escos to adhere to in evaluating the savings achieved by ecms these guidelines are called the international performance measurement and verification protocol ipmvp homeowners implementing ecms in their residential buildings often start with an energy audit this is a way homeowners look at what areas of their homes are using and possibly losing energy residential energy auditors are accredited by the building performance institute bpi 9 or the residential energy services network resnet 10 11 homeowners can hire a professional or do it themselves 12 13 or use a smartphone to help do an audit 14  contents 1 types of energy conservation measures 1.1 energy dashboards 1.2 insulation 1.3

combine smart metering and internet technologies to provide real-time data on energy use their success is based on the premise that real-time feedback drives behavior change and improves operational efficiency energy dashboards are used to enable energy reduction competitions showcase real-time building performance and green building features and empower occupants to become active participants in energy management sustainability teams from major corporations governments universities and kâ€“12 public schools use energy dashboards as an effective communication tool that creates transparency

climates thus reducing hvac loads house insulation thermal insulation cotton insulation natural wool insulation vocs in fiberglass insulation cellulose insulation lightingedit one of the simplest ways consumers save a copious amount of energy is switching incandescent light bulb to a compact fluorescent lamp cfl a 15w cfl is capable of providing just as much light as a 60w incandescent while consuming just one fourth of the amount of energy 15 compact fluorescent lamp fluorescent bulbs led lighting linear fluorescent retrofit t12 to t8 sky lights smart windows solar charged flashlight

related to windows more cost effective than others such as thermal curtains films or smart windows please add more referencesedit
