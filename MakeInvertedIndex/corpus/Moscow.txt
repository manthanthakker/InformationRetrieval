towns and sister cities 17.1 notes  etymologyedit the name of the city is thought to be derived from the name of the moskva river 15 16 there have been proposed several theories of the origin of the name of the river the most linguistically well-grounded and widely accepted is from the proto-balto-slavic root mŭzg-muzg- from the proto-indo-european meu- wet 16 17 18 so the name moskva might signify a river at a wetland or a marsh 15 its cognates include russian музга muzga pool puddle lithuanian mazgoti and latvian mazgāt to wash sanskrit majjati to drown latin mergō to dip immerse 15 17 there exist as well similar place names in poland like mozgawa 15 16 17 the original old russian form of the name is reconstructed as москы mosky 15 16 hence it was one of a few slavic ū-stem nouns as with other nouns of that declension it had been undergoing a morphological transformation at the early stage of the development of the language as a result the first written mentions in the 12th century were московь moskovĭ accusative case москви moskvi locative case москвeмосквѣ moskvemoskvě genitive case 15 16 from the latter forms came the modern russian name москва moskva which is a result of morphological generalization with the numerous slavic ā-stem nouns however the form moskovĭ has left some traces in many other languages such as english moscow german moskau french moscou latvian maskava ottoman turkish moskov tatar мәскәү mäskäw kazakh мәскеу mäskew chuvash мускав muskav etc in a similar manner the latin name moscovia has been formed later it became a colloquial name for russia used in western europe in the 16th–17th centuries from it as well came english muscovy various other theories of celtic iranian caucasic finno-ugrian origin having little or no scientific ground are now largely rejected by contemporary linguists 15 16 there has been as well a naïve scholastic etymology that connected the name of mosoch a son of japheth with the name of the city so that it was thought that the biblical figure was a forefather of russians as well as other slavs the surface similarity of the name russia with rosh an obscure biblical tribe or country which is mentioned alongside with mosoch in ezekiel  38:2–3 39:1 strengthened up such etymologies 19 historyedit prehistoryedit the oldest evidence of humans on the territory of moscow dates from the neolithic schukinskaya site on the moscow river within the modern bounds of the city other late evidence was discovered the burial ground of the fatyanovskaya culture the site of the iron age settlement of the dyakovo culture on the territory of the kremlin sparrow hills setun river and kuntsevskiy forest park etc in the 9th century the oka river was part of the volga trade route and the upper volga watershed became an area of contact between the indigenous uralic peoples such as the merya and the expanding volga bulgars particularly the second son of khan kubrat who expanded the borders of the old great bulgaria germanic varangians and slavic peoples the earliest east slavic tribes recorded as having expanded to the upper volga in the 9th to 10th centuries are the vyatichi and krivichi the moskva river was incorporated as part of rostov-suzdal into the kievan rus in the 11th century by ad 1100 a minor settlement had appeared on the mouth of the neglinnaya river early history  1147–1283edit the first known reference to moscow dates from 1147 as a meeting place of yuri dolgoruky and sviatoslav olgovich at the time it was a minor town on the western border of vladimir-suzdal principality in 1156 knjaz yury dolgoruky fortified the town with a timber fence and a moat in the course of the mongol invasion of rus the mongols under batu khan burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants the timber fort na moskvě on the moscow river was inherited by daniel the youngest son of alexander nevsky in the 1260s at the time considered the least valuable of his fathers possessions daniel was still a child at the time and the big fort was governed by tiuns deputies appointed by daniels paternal uncle yaroslav of tver daniel came of age in the 1270s and became involved in the power struggles of the principality with lasting success siding with his brother dmitry in his bid for the rule of novgorod from 1283 he acted as the ruler of an independent principality alongside dmitry who became grand duke of vladimir daniel has been credited with founding the first moscow monasteries dedicated to the lords epiphany and to saint daniel grand duchy  1283–1547edit daniel i ruled moscow as grand duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city which would eclipse its parent principality of vladimir by the 1320s on the right bank of the moskva river at a distance of five miles  8.0 kilometres from the kremlin not later than in 1282 daniel founded the first monastery with the wooden church of st daniel-stylite now it is the danilov monastery daniel died in 1303 at the age of 42 before his death he became a monk and according to his will was buried in the cemetery of the st daniel monastery moscow was stable and prosperous for many years and attracted a large numbers of refugees from across russia the rurikids maintained large landholdings by practicing primogeniture whereby all land was passed to the eldest sons rather than dividing it up among all sons by 1304 yury of moscow contested with mikhail of tver for the throne of the principality of vladimir ivan i eventually defeated tver to become the sole collector of taxes for the mongol rulers making moscow the capital of vladimir-suzdal by paying high tribute ivan won an important concession from the khan while khan of the golden horde initially attempted to limit moscows influence when the growth of the grand duchy of lithuania began to threaten all of russia the khan strengthened moscow to counterbalance lithuania allowing it to become one of the most powerful cities in russia in 1380 prince dmitry donskoy of moscow led a united russian army to an important victory over the mongols in the battle of kulikovo afterwards moscow took the leading role in liberating russia from mongol domination in 1480 ivan iii had finally broken the russians free from tatar control and moscow became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of russia and siberia and parts of many other lands in 1462 ivan iii known as ivan the great  1440–1505 became grand prince of moscow then part of the medieval muscovy state he began fighting the tatars enlarged the territory of muscovy and enriched his capital city by 1500 it had a population of 100,000 and was one of the largest cities in the world he conquered the far larger principality of novgorod to the north which had been allied to the hostile lithuanians thus he enlarged the territory sevenfold from 430,000 to 2,800,000 square kilometres  170,000 to 1,080,000 square miles he took control of the ancient novgorod chronicle and made it a propaganda vehicle for his regime 20 21 the original moscow kremlin was built during the 14th century it was reconstructed by ivan who in the 1480s invited architects from renaissance italy such as petrus antonius solarius who designed the new kremlin wall and its towers and marco ruffo who designed the new palace for the prince the kremlin walls as they now appear are those designed by solarius completed in 1495 the kremlins great bell tower was built in 1505–08 and augmented to its present height in 1600 a trading settlement or posad grew up to the east of the kremlin in the area known as zaradye зарядье in the time of ivan iii the red square originally named the hollow field полое поле appeared in 1508–1516 the italian architect aleviz fryazin novy arranged for the construction of a moat in front of the eastern wall which would connect the moskva and neglinnaya and be filled in with water from neglinnaya this moat known as the alevizov moat and having a length of 541 metres  1,775 feet width of 36 metres  118 feet and a depth of 9.5to 13 metres  31–43 feet was lined with limestone and in 1533 fenced on both sides with low four-metre-thick  13-foot cogged-brick walls  tsardom  1547–1721edit in the 16th and 17th centuries the three circular defenses were built kitay-gorod китай-город the white city белый город and the earthen city земляной город however in 1547 two fires destroyed much of the town and in 1571 the crimean tatars captured moscow burning everything except the kremlin 22 the annals record that only 30,000 of 200,000 inhabitants survived the crimean tatars attacked again in 1591 but this time were held back by new defense walls built between 1584 and 1591 by a craftsman named fyodor kon in 1592 an outer earth rampart with 50 towers was erected around the city including an area on the right bank of the moscow river as an outermost line of defense a chain of strongly fortified monasteries was established beyond the ramparts to the south and east principally the novodevichy convent and donskoy danilov simonov novospasskiy and andronikov monasteries most of which now house museums from its ramparts the city became poetically known as bielokamennaya the white-walled the limits of the city as marked by the ramparts built in 1592 are now marked by the garden ring three square gates existed on the eastern side of the kremlin wall which in the 17th century were known as konstantino-eleninsky spassky nikolsky owing their names to the icons of constantine and helen the savior and st nicholas which hung over them the last two were directly opposite the red square while the konstantino-elenensky gate was located behind saint basils cathedral the russian famine of 1601–03 killed perhaps 100,000 in moscow from 1610 through 1612 troops of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth occupied moscow as its ruler sigismund iii tried to take the russian throne in 1612 the people of nizhny

 1662 and the moscow uprising of 1682 during the first half of the 17th century the population of moscow doubled from roughly 100,000 to 200,000 it expanded beyond its ramparts in the later 17th century by 1682 there were 692 households established north of the ramparts by ukrainians and belarusians abducted from their hometowns in the course of russo-polish war  1654–1667 these new outskirts of the city came to be known as the meshchanskaya sloboda after ruthenian meshchane town people the term meshchane мещане acquired pejorative connotations in 18th-century russia and today means petty bourgeois or narrow-minded philistine 23 the entire city of the late 17th century including the slobodas which grew up outside of the city ramparts are contained within what is today moscows central administrative okrug numerous disasters befell the city the plague epidemics ravaged moscow in 1570–1571 1592 and 1654–1656 24 the plague killed upwards of 80 of the people in 1654–55 fires burned out much of the wooden city in 1626 and 1648 25 empire  1721–1917edit moscow ceased to be russias capital except for a brief period from 1728 to 1732 under the influence of the supreme privy council when peter the great moved his government to the newly built saint petersburg on the baltic coast in 1712 after losing the status as capital of the empire the population of moscow at first decreased from 200,000 in the 17th century to 130,000 in 1750 but after 1750 the population grew more than tenfold over the remaining duration of the russian empire reaching 1.8 million by 1915 by 1700 the building of cobbled roads had begun in november 1730 the permanent street light was introduced and by 1867 many streets had a gaslight in 1883 near the prechistinskiye gates arc lamps were installed in 1741 moscow was surrounded by a barricade 25 miles  40 kilometres long the kamer-kollezhskiy barrier with 16 gates at which customs tolls were collected its line is traced today by a number of streets called val ramparts between 1781–1804 the mytischinskiy water-pipe the first in russia was built in 1813 a commission for the construction of the city of moscow was established it launched a great program of rebuilding including a partial replanning of the city-center among many buildings constructed or reconstructed at this time were the grand kremlin palace and the kremlin armoury the moscow university the moscow manege riding school and the bolshoi theatre in 1903 the moskvoretskaya water-supply was completed in the early 19th century the arch of konstantino-elenensky gate was paved with bricks but the spassky gate was the main front gate of the kremlin and used for royal entrances from this gate wooden and following the 17th-century improvements stone bridges stretched across the moat books were sold on this bridge and stone platforms were built nearby for guns  raskats the tsar cannon was located on the platform of the lobnoye mesto the road connecting moscow with st petersburg now the m10 highway was completed in 1746 its moscow end following the old tver road which had existed since the 16th century it became known as peterburskoye schosse after it was paved in

arrived and departed from vsekhsvyatskoye station when napoleon invaded russia in 1812 the moscovites were evacuated it is suspected that the moscow fire was principally the effect of russian sabotage napoleons grande armée was forced to retreat and was nearly annihilated by the devastating russian winter and sporadic attacks by russian military forces as many as 400,000 of napoleons soldiers died during this time 26 moscow state university was established in 1755 its main building was reconstructed after the 1812 fire by domenico giliardi the moskovskiye vedomosti newspaper appeared from 1756 originally in weekly intervals and from 1859 as a daily newspaper the arbat street had been in existence since at least the 15th century but it was developed into a prestigious area during the 18th century it was destroyed in the fire of 1812 and was rebuilt completely in the early 19th century in the 1830s general alexander bashilov planned the first regular grid of city streets north from petrovsky palace khodynka field south of the highway was used for military training smolensky rail station forerunner of present-day belorussky rail terminal was inaugurated in 1870 sokolniki park in

from the farms elites called for improving sanitation which became part of catherines plans for increasing control over social life national political and military successes from 1812 through 1855 calmed the critics and validated efforts to produce a more enlightened and stable society there was less talk about the smell and the poor conditions of public health however in the wake of russias failures in the crimean war in 1855–56 confidence in the ability of the state to maintain order in the slums eroded and demands for improved public health put filth back on the agenda 27 soviet era  1917–1991edit following the success of the russian revolution of 1917 vladimir lenin fearing possible foreign invasion moved the capital from saint petersburg back to moscow on march 5 1918 the

the summer olympic games which were boycotted by the united states and several other western countries due to the soviet unions involvement in afghanistan in late 1979 in 1991 moscow was the scene of a coup attempt by conservators opposed to the liberal reforms of mikhail gorbachev metroedit the moscow metro opened in 1935 and immediately became the centerpiece of the transportation system more than that it was a stalinist device to awe and control the populace and give them an appreciation of soviet realist art it became the prototype for future soviet large-scale technologies lazar kaganovich was in charge he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of stalinist civilization as they rode the artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous for example the sverdlov square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the soviet peoples and the bas-reliefs at the dynamo stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new homo sovieticus soviet man 31 the metro was touted as the symbol of the new social ordera sort of communist cathedral of engineering modernity 32 soviet workers did the labor and the art work but the main engineering designs routes and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the london underground the britons called for tunneling instead of the cut-and-cover technique the use of escalators instead of lifts and designed the routes and the rolling stock 33 the paranoia of stalin and the nkvd was evident when the secret police arrested numerous british engineers for espionagethat is for gaining an in-depth knowledge of the citys physical layout engineers for the metropolitan vickers electrical company were given a show trial and deported in 1933 ending the role of british business in the ussr 34 recent history  1991 to presentedit when the ussr was dissolved in the same year moscow became

sustainable metropolitan development typified by the greenbelt built in 1935 since then however there has been a dramatic growth of low-density suburban sprawl created by a heavy demand for single-family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments in 1995–1997 the mkad ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes in december 2002 bulvar dmitriya donskogo became the first moscow metro station that opened beyond the limits of mkad the third ring road intermediate between the early 19th-century garden ring and the soviet era outer ring road was completed in 2004 the greenbelt is becoming more and more fragmented and satellite cities are appearing at the fringe summer dachas are being converted into year-round residences and with the proliferation of automobiles

protestantism and rodnovery the patriarch of moscow serves as the head of the church and resides in the danilov monastery moscow was called the city of 40 times 40 churchesгород сорока сороков церквейprior to 1917 in 1918 the bolshevik government declared russia a secular state which in practice meant that religion was repressed and society was to become atheistic during the period of 1920-1930s a great number of churches in moscow were demolished including historical chudov monastery in the kremlin dating from the 14th century kazansky cathedral on the red square the cathedral of christ the savior constructed in the 19th century in memory of a victory over napoleons army in 1812 and many more this continued even after the second world war in 1940-1970s when persecutions against religion in the soviet union became less severe most of the surviving churches and monasteries were closed and then used as clubs offices factories or even warehouses since the disintegration of the soviet union in 1991 many of the destroyed churches have been restored and traditional religions are once again gaining popularity among the churches reconstructed in the 1990s is an impressive new cathedral of christ the savior which once more has become a landmark it was built on the site of the old demolished cathedral where there had been a huge open swimming-pool until 1994 the moscow mufti council claimed that muslims numbered around 1.5 million of 10.5 millions of the citys population in 2010 60 there are four mosques in the city 61 moscow cathedral mosque has been built at the

of palestinian territories mahmoud abbas and local muslim leaders participated in the inauguration ceremony of this mosque 62 religious statisticsedit cityscapeedit architectureedit moscows architecture is world-renowned moscow is the site of saint basils cathedral with its elegant onion domes as well as the cathedral of christ the savior and the seven sisters the first kremlin was built in the middle of the 12th century medieval moscows design was of concentric walls and intersecting radial thoroughfares this layout as well as moscows rivers helped shape moscows design in subsequent centuries the kremlin was rebuilt in the 15th century its towers and some of its churches were built by italian architects lending the city some of the aura of the renaissance from the end of the 15th century the city was embellished by masonry structures such as monasteries palaces walls towers and churches the citys appearance had not changed much by the 18th century houses were made of pine and spruce logs with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark the rebuilding of moscow in the second half of the 18th century was necessitated not only by constant fires but also the needs of the nobility much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style 64 for much of its architectural history moscow was dominated by orthodox churches however the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during soviet times especially as a result of joseph stalins large-scale effort to modernize moscow stalins plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways some of them over ten lanes wide which while greatly simplifying movement through the city were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts among the many casualties of stalins demolitions was the sukharev tower a longtime city landmark as well as mansions and commercial buildings the citys newfound status as the capital of a deeply secular nation made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition many of the citys churches which in most cases were some of moscows oldest and most prominent buildings were destroyed some notable examples include the kazan cathedral and the cathedral of christ the savior during the 1990s both were rebuilt many smaller churches however were lost 65 while the later stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation the earlier post-revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with vkhutemas responsible for such landmarks as lenins mausoleum another prominent architect was vladimir shukhov famous for shukhov tower just one of many hyperboloid towers designed by shukhov it was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a russian broadcasting company 66 shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the constructivist architecture of early soviet russia he designed spacious elongated shop galleries most notably the gum department store on red square 66 bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults perhaps the most recognizable contributions of the stalinist period are the so-called seven sisters comprising seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the kremlin a defining feature of moscows skyline their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the manhattan municipal building in new york city and their stylewith intricate exteriors and a large central spirehas been described as stalinist gothic architecture all seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city they are among the tallest constructions in central moscow apart from the ostankino tower which when it was completed in 1967 was the highest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the worlds seventy-second tallest ranking among buildings such as the burj khalifa in dubai taipei 101 in taiwan and the cn tower in toronto 67 the soviet goal of providing housing for every family and the rapid growth of moscows population led to the construction of large monotonous housing blocks most of these date from the post-stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power brezhnev khrushchev etc they are usually badly maintained although the city still has some five-story apartment buildings constructed before the mid-1960s more recent apartment buildings are usually at least nine floors tall and have elevators it is estimated that moscow has over twice as many elevators as new york city and four times as many as chicago moslift one of the citys major elevator operating companies has about 1500 elevator mechanics on call to release residents trapped in elevators 68 stalinist-era buildings mostly found in the central part of the city are massive and usually ornamented with socialist realism motifs that imitate classical themes however small churches  almost always eastern orthodox found across the city provide glimpses of its past the old arbat street a tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area preserves most of its buildings from prior to the 20th century many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city behind the stalinist façades of tverskaya street for example are also examples of bourgeois architecture typical of tsarist times ostankino palace kuskovo uzkoye and other large estates just outside moscow originally belong to nobles from the tsarist era and some convents and monasteries both inside and outside the city are open to muscovites and tourists attempts are being made to restore many of the citys best-kept examples of pre-soviet architecture these restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless façades there are a few examples of notable early soviet avant-garde work too such as the house of the architect konstantin melnikov in the arbat area many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of historical authenticity facadism is also widely practiced 69 later examples of interesting soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi-modernist styles employed such as with the novy arbat project familiarly known as false teeth of moscow and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in central moscow involved in the project plaques on house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there frequently the plaques are dedicated to soviet celebrities not well-known outside or often like with decorated generals and revolutionaries now both inside of russia there are also many museum houses of famous russian writers composers and artists in the city moscows skyline is quickly modernizing with several new towers under construction in recent years the city administration has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings as much as a third of historic moscow has been destroyed in the past few years 70 to make space for luxury apartments and hotels 71 other historical buildings including such landmarks as the 1930 moskva hotel and the 1913 department store voyentorg have been razed and reconstructed anew with the inevitable loss of historical value critics blame the government for not enforcing conservation laws in the last 12 years more than 50 buildings with monument status were torn down several of those dating back to the 17th century 72 some critics also wonder if the money used for the reconstruction of razed buildings could not be used for the renovation of decaying structures which include many works by architect konstantin melnikov 73 and mayakovskaya metro station some organizations such as moscow architecture preservation society 74 and save europes heritage 75 are trying to draw the international public attention to these problems 76 parks and landmarksedit there are 96 parks and 18 gardens in moscow including four botanical gardens there are 450 square kilometres  170sqmi of green zones besides 100 square
