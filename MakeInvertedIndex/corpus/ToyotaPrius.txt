as a 5-door hatchback since 2003 the united states environmental protection agency and california air resources board carb rate the prius as among the cleanest vehicles sold in the united states based on smog-forming emissions 1 the 2016 model year prius eco ranks as the all-time most fuel efficient gasoline-powered car available in the us without plug-in capability 2 3 the prius first went on sale in japan in 1997 and was available at all four toyota japan dealerships making it the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle it was subsequently introduced worldwide in 2000 4 the prius is sold in over 90 markets with japan and the united states being its largest markets 5 global cumulative prius liftback sales reached the milestone 1million vehicle mark in may 2008 6 2million in september 2010 7 and passed the 3million mark in june 2013 8 cumulative sales of one million were achieved in the us by early april 2011 9 and japan reached the 1million mark in august 2011 10 as of april 2016update the prius liftback is the worlds top selling hybrid car with 3.73million units sold 5 in 2011 toyota expanded the prius family to include the prius v an extended hatchback wagon and the prius c a subcompact hatchback the production version of the prius plug-in hybrid was released in 2012 the second generation of the plug-in variant the prius prime is scheduled to be released by the end of 2016 toyota expects the prime to achieve the highest miles per gallon equivalent mpge rating in all-electric mode of any plug-in hybrid available in the market 11 12 global sales of the prius c variant

latin word meaning first original or superior according to toyota the name was chosen because the prius was launched before environmental awareness became a mainstream social issue 15 in february 2011 toyota asked the public to decide on what the most proper plural form of prius should be with choices including prien prii prium prius or priuses 16 17 the company said it would use the most popular choice in its advertising 18 and on 20 february announced that prii was the most popular choice and the new official plural designation 19 in latin prius is the neuter singular of the comparative form prior prior prius of an adjective with only comparative and superlative the superlative being primus prima primum consequently like all third declension words the plural in latin was priora cf latin declension which was used by the lada priora in 2007 despite the official plural form used by toyota priuses remains good english 20 and is the more frequently used plural form beginning in september 2011 toyota usa began using the following names to differentiate the original prius from some newer members of the prius family the standard prius became the prius liftback the prius v known as the prius α in japan and prius  in europe the prius plug-in hybrid and the prius c called toyota aqua in japan 21 22 first generation xw10 1997–2003edit in 1995 toyota debuted a hybrid concept car at the tokyo motor show with testing following a year later 23 the first prius model nhw10 went on sale on 10 december 1997 24 25 it was available only in japan though it has been imported privately to at least the united states united kingdom australia and new zealand 26 the first generation prius at its launch became the worlds first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car at its introduction in 1997 it won the car of the year japan award and in 1998 it won the automotive researchers and journalists conference car of the year award in japan uk sales of the first generation prius began on 19 october 2000 27 production commenced in december 1997 at the takaoka plant in toyota aichi ending in february 2000 after cumulative production of 37,425 vehicles 28 production recommenced in may 2000 at the motomachi plant in the same area before xw10 manufacture ended in june 2003 after a further 33,411 vehicles had been produced 29 the nhw10 prius styling originated from california designers who were selected over competing designs from other toyota design studios 25 in the united states the nhw11 was the first prius to be sold the prius was marketed between the smaller corolla and the larger camry the published retail price of the car was us$19,995 30 the nhw11 prius became more powerful partly to satisfy the higher speeds and longer distances that americans drive 31 air conditioning and electric power steering were standard equipment 32 the vehicle was the second mass-produced hybrid on the american market after the two-seat honda insight 33 while the larger prius could seat five its battery pack restricted cargo space the prius was offered in us in three trim packages standard base and touring the us epa carb classified the car with an air pollution score of 3 out of 10 as an ultra low emission vehicle ulev 34 prius owners were eligible for up to a us$2,000 federal tax deduction from their gross income 33 in contrast with the nw10 toyota executives stated that the company broke even financially on sales of the nhw11 prius 33 european sales began in september 2000 35 the official launch of the prius in australia occurred at the october 2001 sydney motor show 36 although sales were slow until the nhw20 xw20 model arrived toyota sold about 123,000 first generation priuses 8 second generation xw20 2003–2009edit presented at the 2003 new york international auto show for the 2004 us model year the prius was completely redesigned it became a mid-size liftback sized between the corolla and the camry with redistributed mechanical and interior space significantly increasing rear-seat legroom and luggage room the new prius is even more environmentally friendly than the previous model according to the epa and is 6 inches  150mm longer than the previous version 38 its more aerodynamic kammback body balances length and wind resistance resulting in a drag coefficient ofcd=0.26 39 the development effort led by chief engineer shigeyuki hori led to 530 patents for the vehicle 40 production commenced in august 2003 at the tsutsumi plant in toyota aichi 41 supplemented in october 2004 with the fujimatsu plant at kariya aichi 42 the prius uses an all-electric ac compressor for cooling an industry first 43 combined with a smaller and lighter nimh battery the xw20 is more powerful and more efficient than the xw10 44 in the us the battery pack of 2004 and later models is warranted for 150,000 miles  240,000km or 10 years in states that have adopted the stricter california emissions control standards and 100,000 miles  160,000km or 8 years elsewhere 45 46 the warranty for hybrid components is 100,000 miles  160,000km or 8 years 47 it is classified as a sulev super ultra low emissions vehicle and is certified by california air resources board as an advanced technology partial zero emission vehicle at-pzev 48 from 2005 to 2009 the second generation prius had been built by faw-toyota in the city of changchun for the chinese market 49 it was reported that a total of 2,152 priuses were sold in 2006 and 414 in 2007 the relatively low sales was blamed on high price about us$15,000 higher than the equivalent in japan or the us caused by high duties on imported parts 50 in early march 2008 toyota cut the price of prius by up to eight percent or us$3,000 to cn¥259,800 us$36,500 it was thought that the sales dropped as a result of both a lack of acceptance and increased competition the honda civic hybrid was exported to china from 2007 51 toyota sold about 1,192,000-second generation priuses worldwide 8 safetyedit us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa crash testing of the 2004 us model year prius yielded a five-star driver and four-star passenger rating in the frontal-collision test out of five stars side crash results were four out of five stars for both front and rear seats the car scored four out of five stars in rollover testing 53 us insurance institute for highway safety crash tests scored the prius good overall in frontal collisions and good overall in side-impact collisions in models equipped with side airbags 54 a poor score was given to models without side airbags 55 side curtain and torso airbags became standard on 2007 american models third generation xw30 2009–2015edit toyota debuted the new prius  2010 us model year at the january 2009 north american international auto show 58 and sales began in japan on 18 may 2009 59 toyota cut the price of the prius from ¥2.331 million to ¥2.05 million to better compete with the honda insight 60 leading some to wonder whether increased sales of the prius might come at the expense of sales of other vehicles with higher margins competition from lower priced hybrids such as the honda insight also made it difficult for toyota to capitalize on the priuss success 61 as of june 2013update toyota has sold about 1,688,000 third-generation priuses worldwide 8 at its introduction in 2009 it won the car of the year japan award for the second time its new body design is more aerodynamic with a reduced drag coefficient ofcd=0.25 this figure is disputed by general motors which found the value for the model with 17-inch wheels to be around 0.30 based on tests in gm ford and chrysler wind tunnels 62 car  driver measured the third generation prius at 0.26 in a privately arranged five-way wind-tunnel test of comparable cars 63 an underbody rear fin helps stabilize the vehicle at higher speeds the roof has a special design of a double wave to keep down the air resistancebut this design is not present on the solar roof modelcitation needed the estimated fuel-efficiency rating using the us epa combined cycle is 50mpg-us  4.7l/100km 60mpg-imp 64 the prius was the most efficient car powered by liquid fuel available in the us in 2009 based on the official rating 65 only the first-generation honda insight  2000–2006 equipped with a manual transmission attained a lower fuel consumption rate the official uk fuel efficiency data for the prius t3 is urban 72.4mpg-imp  3.90l/100km 60.3mpg-us extra urban 76.4mpg-imp  3.70l/100km 63.6mpg-us combined 72.4mpg-imp  3.90l/100km 60.3mpg-us 66 the 1.8-liter gasoline engine previously 1.5 liters generates 98hp  73kw and with the added power of the electric motor generates a total of 134hp  100kw previously 110hp or 82kw the larger engine displacement allows for increased torque reducing engine speeds rpm which improves fuel economy at highway speeds thanks to its electric water pump the prius engine is the first consumer automotive production engine that requires no accessory belts which also further improves its fuel economy 67 the electric motors and other components of the hybrid powertrain are also smaller and more efficient than the industry average 68 toyota estimates the new inverter motor and transaxle are 20 percent lighter in constructing the prius toyota used a new range of plant-derived ecological bioplastics made out of cellulose derived from wood or grass instead of petroleum the two principal crops used are kenaf and ramie kenaf is a member of the hibiscus family a relative to cotton and okra ramie commonly known as china grass is a member of the nettle family and one of the strongest natural fibres with a density and absorbency comparable to flax toyota says this is a particularly timely breakthrough for plant-based eco-plastics because 2009 is the united nations international year of natural fibres which spotlights kenaf and ramie among others 69 to create the third-generation prius for 2010 toyota engineers revisited just about everything to eke out further efficiencies a new front-drive platform underpinned the car although the wheelbase remained unchanged and overall length grew by a lone centimetre weight-saving aluminum was employed in the hood rear hatch front axle and brake calipers disc brakes were finally assigned to all four wheels 70 in december 2013 consumer reports named the prius as the best value for the second year in a row 71 high trim levels in the third generation prius include features like softex trim seats that look and feel just like leather but are lighter in weight headlight washers parking sensors premium jbl speaker system and electrically operated lumbar support adjustment for the drivers seat in mid-2011 for the 2012 model year the third-generation prius liftback received modest style and equipment changes the exterior changes include updated headlamps revised tail lamps plus a distinctive front fascia and bumper and the deletion of the super white color option in the united states prospective american prius buyers wanting a white exterior had to choose the blizzard pearl color a metallic off-white for an additional $220 or choose another make or model the prius could be equipped with an updated infotainment system featuring the optional toyota entune suite of connectivity features other updates included a 6.1-inch touch-screen an amfm cd player unit a usb port for ipod connectivity an auxiliary input jack a bluetooth hands-free phone capability and streaming audio the prius also included an optional solar panel on the roof of the car solely to power a ventilation fan while the car is parked to keep the interior cooler in sunny conditions in the us market only the prius two three four and five were offered the premium prius five models advanced technology package included the premium hdd navigation system plus the head-up display dynamic radar cruise control pre-collision system and lane keep assist the pre-collision system retracted the front seatbelts and applies the brakes in certain conditions when it determines that a crash is unavoidable lane keep assist helped the driver stay within the lane 21 the us 2012 model year included toyotas vehicle proximity notification system vpns which emitted an artificial engine noise to alert pedestrians the blind and others of the vehicles presence due to significant noise reduction typical of a hybrid vehicle traveling at low speeds in all-electric mode 72 72 fourth generation xw50 2015presentedit the fourth generation prius was first shown during september 2015 in las vegas 74 and was released for retail customers in japan in december 2015 the launch in north american market occurred in january 2016 and february in europe 73 toyota expected to sell 12,000 fourth generation prius cars a month in japan and to reach annual sales between 300,000 and 350,000 units 73 in august 2013 toyota managing officer satoshi ogiso who was chief engineer for the prius line announced some of the improvements and key features of the next generation prius 75 76 the next prius is the first vehicle to use the toyota new global architecture tnga modular platform which provides a lower center of gravity and increased structural rigidity these features along with other improvements allow for gains in ride-and-handling agility and aerodynamics the improved aerodynamics contribute to an all-new exterior design which includes a roomier interior ogiso also explained that the next-generation prius plug-in hybrid the prius prime was developed in parallel with the standard prius model 77 78 the fourth generation prius has stirred controversy over the style and cohesion of its exterior design with analysis from critics contending that the excessively angular headlamps and unnecessary creases in the bodywork has created a haphazard design that falls into the trap of equating aggressiveness with sportiness 79 the fourth-generation prius is designed to deliver significantly improved fuel economy in a more compact package that is lighter in weight and lower in cost these objectives were achieved through the development of a new generation of powertrains with significant advances in battery electric motor and gasoline engine technologies it features improved batteries with higher energy density smaller electric motors with higher power density than the previous prius motors and the gasoline engine features a thermal efficiency greater than 40 that of the third-generation prius is 38.5 the prius fuel economy has improved on average by about 10 each generation and toyota has set the challenge to continue to improve at this rate 77 78 under the japanese jc08 cycle test toyota expects the fourth generation prius to achieve a fuel economy rating of 40.8kml  115mpg-imp 96mpg-us 73 the 2016 model year prius has an official epa fuel economy rating of 54mpg-us  4.4l/100km 65mpg-imp for city 50mpg-us  4.7l/100km 60mpg-imp for highway and 52mpg-us

city 53mpg-us  4.4l/100km 64mpg-imp highway and 56mpg-us  4.2l/100km 67mpg-imp combined 80 this improved efficiency is largely due to the reduced weight of the eco which has a lighter battery and does not carry a spare tire 81 in terms of fuel economy the 2016 prius eco with a combined cityhighway fuel economy of 56mpg-us  4.2l/100km 67mpg-imp passed the 2000 first generation honda insight  53mpg-us  4.4l/100km 64mpg-imp as the most fuel efficient car available in the us without plug-in capability however the honda insight still achieves highway rating of 61mpg-us  3.9l/100km 73mpg-imp

almost tripled to 208,876 in 2009 131 in that year it overtook the honda fit which was japans best-selling car in 2008 excluding kei cars rising oil prices caused by the arab spring led to increased sales of the prius in the first quarter of 2011 but the 2011 tōhoku earthquake and tsunami led to a production stoppage production restarted several days later but output was hindered due to shortages from parts suppliers 132 nevertheless during the 2011 japanese fiscal year  1 april 2011 through 31 march 2012 the prius family sold 310,484 units including sales of the prius α launched in may 2011

nissan leaf 145 the toyota prius liftback with 147,503 units sold was the best selling hybrid in 2012 the prius v ranked third with 40,669 units and the prius c was fourth with 35,733 units 104 toyota usa estimated that sales of its hybrids models in 2012 would represent 14 of total toyota sales in the country 146 since their inception in 1999 a total of 1.5 million prius family members have been sold in the us by mid october 2013 147 representing a 50.1 market share of total hybrid sales in the country of these 1,356,318 are conventional prius liftbacks sold through september 2013 104 128 148 149 prius family sales also set a record in japan in march 2012 accounting for the conventional prius and prius α sales a total of 45,496 units were sold in march 2012 becoming the highest monthly sales ever for any model in japan since 1997 and representing a market share of 9 of all new car registrations excluding kei cars the toyota aqua sold 29,156 units ranking as the third top selling car that month together all prius family vehicles sold 74,652 units representing 15 of monthly new car sales in march 2012 150 151 with a total of 247,230 vehicles sold during the first quarter of 2012 the toyota prius family became the third top selling nameplate in the world in terms of total global sales after the toyota corolla  300,800 units and the ford focus  277,000 units 152 153 liftback salesedit sales of non-liftbackedit the following table presents retail sales of the other vehicles of the prius family by year since deliveries began in 2011 through april 2016 design and technologyedit the prius is a power-split or series-parallel full hybrid sometimes referred to as a combined hybrid a vehicle that can be propelled by gasoline andor electric power wind resistance is reduced by a drag coefficient of 0.25  0.29 for 2000 model with a kammback design to reduce air resistance lower rolling-resistance tires are used to reduce road friction an electric water pump eliminates serpentine belts 157 in the us and canada a vacuum flask is used to store hot coolant when the vehicle is powered off for reuse so as to reduce warm-up time the prius engine makes use of the atkinson cycle 158 ev modeedit when the vehicle is turned on with the power button it is ready to drive immediately with the electric motor in the second generation prius electric pumps warm the engine by pumping previously saved hot engine coolant from a coolant thermos 159 before the internal combustion engine is started the delay between powering the car on and starting the internal combustion engine is approximately seven seconds the third generation prius does not have a coolant thermos instead the engine is heated by recapturing exhaust heat a button labelled ev maintains electric vehicle mode after being powered on and under most low-load conditions at less than 25mph  40kmh this permits driving with low noise and no fuel consumption for journeys under 1 mile  1.6km the car automatically reverts to normal mode if the battery becomes exhausted 160 161 prior to the 2010 model the north american model did not have the ev button although the ev mode is still supported internally by the prius hybrid vehicle management computercitation needed batteriesedit there are two principal battery packs the high voltage hv battery also known as the traction battery and a 12 volt battery known as the low voltage lv battery the traction battery is a sealed 38-module nickel metal hydride nimh battery pack providing 273.6 volts 6.5 ah capacity and weighing 53.3kg  118lb 162 and is supplied by japans panasonic ev energy co they are normally charged between 40–60 of maximum capacity to prolong battery life as well as allow headroom for regenerative braking each battery pack uses 10–15kg  22–33lb of lanthanum and each prius electric motor contains 1kg  2lb of neodymium production of the car is described as the biggest user of rare earths of any object in the world 163 the lv battery is essential to starting the car providing initial power to the computer the second generation prius contains a 1.310kwh battery composed of 28 modules each battery module is made of 6 individual 1.2v 6.5ah prismatic nimh cells in series forming a 7.2v 6.5ah module with 46whkg energy density and 1,3kwkg output power density 164 each module contains an integrated charge controller and relay these modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6v 6.5ah battery traction battery also known as the energy storage system the computer controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38 and 82 state of charge with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60 by shallow cycling the battery only a small portion of its net available energy storage capacity is available for use approximately 400wh by the hybrid drive system but the shallow computer controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life thermal management control and net long term calendar life of the battery active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design battery life cycleedit as the prius reached ten years of being available in the us market in february 2011 consumer reports decided to look at the lifetime of the prius battery and the cost to replace it the magazine tested a 2002 toyota prius with over 200,000 miles on it and compared the results to the nearly identical 2001 prius with 2,000 miles tested by consumer reports 10 years before the comparison showed little difference in performance when tested for fuel economy and acceleration overall fuel economy of the 2001 model was 40.6 miles per us gallon  5.79l/100km 48.8mpg-imp while the 2002 prius with high mileage delivered 40.4 miles per us gallon  5.82l/100km 48.5mpg-imp the magazine concluded that the effectiveness of the battery has not degraded over the long run 165 the cost of replacing the first generation battery varies between us$2,200 and us$2,600 from a toyota dealer but low-use units from salvage yards are available for around us$500 165 one study indicates it may be worthwhile to rebuild batteries using good blades from defective used batteries 166 air conditioning hvacedit the hvac system uses an ac induction motor to drive a scroll compressor using a scroll compressor increases the efficiency of the system while driving it with an ac induction motor makes the system more flexible so the ac can run while the engine is off because the oil used with the gas also flows in the area of the motor-windings it needs to be highly insulating therefore a special oil nd11 167 is used the system cannot be maintained with equipment that is used to service regular cars which mainly use pag oils as the equipment would contaminate the nd11 oil with pag oil according to sae j2843 the oil provided from maintenance equipment must contain less than 0.1 pag when filling 1 pag oil may result in a resistance drop by a factor of about 10 168 environmental impactedit fuel economy and emissionsedit since its inception the toyota prius has been among the best fuel economy vehicles available in the united states and for the model year 2012 the prius family has three models among the top 10 most fuel-efficient cars sold in the country as rated by us environmental protection agency epa 3 after the honda insight first generation was discontinued in september 2006 the prius liftback became the most fuel-efficient car sold in the american market 3 169 170 until it was topped by the chevrolet volt in december 2010 as the plug-in hybrid was rated by epa with an overall combined cityhighway gasoline-electricity fuel economy of 60mpg-us  3.9l/100km 72mpg-imp equivalent mpg-e 171 according to the epa for the model year 2012 and when only gasoline-powered vehicles are considered excluding all-electric cars the prius c ranks as the most fuel-efficient compact car the prius liftback as the most fuel-efficient midsize car and the prius v as the most fuel-efficient midsize station wagon 172 more fossil fuel is needed to build hybrid vehicles than a conventional cars but reduced emissions when running the vehicle more than outweigh this 173 the following table presents fuel economy performance and carbon emissions for all prius family models sold in japan since 1997 the ratings are presented for both the older official 10-15 mode cycle test and the new jc08 test designed for japans new standards that went into effect in 2015 but was already being used by several car manufacturers for new cars the prius 2nd generation became the first car to meet japans new 2015 fuel economy standards measured under the jc08 test 176 lifetime energy usageedit in 2008 the british government and british media requested that toyota release detailed figures for the energy use and co2 emissions resulting from the building and disposal of the prius toyota has not supplied the requested data to address statements that the lifetime energy usage of the prius including the increased environmental cost of manufacture and disposal of the nickel-metal hydride battery is outweighed by lower lifetime fuel consumption 183 toyota states that lifetime co2 saving is 43 percent 184 as of 2010update the uk government car service operated over 100 priuses the largest part of its fleet and lists the prius as having the lowest co2 emissions among its fleet 185 cnw marketing research initially published a study 186 in which they estimated that the total lifetime energy cost of a 2005 prius was greater than that of a hummer h2 the study has been widely debunked see for example hummer versus prius dust to dust report misleads the media and public with bad science 187 electromagnetic field levelsedit the prius uses electric motors in the hybrid propulsion systems powered by a high voltage battery in the rear of the car there has been some public concern over whether the levels of electromagnetic field exposure within the cabin are higher than comparable cars and what health effects those fields may present popularized by a 2008 the new york times article 188 however toyota 188 and several independent studies 189 190 have indicated that aside from a brief spike when accelerating the electromagnetic fields within the prius are no different from those of a conventional car and do not exceed the icnirp 191 exposure guidelines a 2013 study by the mayo clinic found that patients with implanted cardiac devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators can safely drive or ride in hybrids or plug-in electric cars without risk of electromagnetic interference emi the research was conducted using implantable devices from the three major manufacturers and a 2012 toyota prius hybrid the study used 30 participants with implanted devices and measured electric and magnetic fields in six positions inside and outside the prius and each position was evaluated at different speeds 192 quietnessedit the wall street journal reported in february 2007 on concerns that quiet cars like the prius may pose a safety risk to those who rely on engine noise to sense the presence or location of moving vehicles 193 blind pedestrians are a primary concern and the national federation of the blind advocates audio emitters on hybrid vehicles 194 but it has been argued that increased risks may also affect sighted pedestrians or bicyclists who are accustomed to aural cues from vehicles however silent vehicles are already relatively common and there is also a lack of aural cues from vehicles that have a conventional internal combustion engine where engine noise has been reduced by noise-absorbing materials in the engine bay and noise-canceling muffler systems in july 2007 a spokesman for toyota said the company is aware of the issue and is studying options 195 in 2010 toyota released a device for the third-generation prius meant to alert pedestrians of its proximity 196 japan issued guidelines for such warning devices in january 2010 and the us approved legislation on december 2010 197 198 models equipped with automatically activated systems include all 2012 and later model year prius family vehicles that have been introduced in the united states including the standard prius the prius v the prius c and the toyota prius plug-in hybrid 72 199 the warning sound is activated when the car is traveling at less than 15mph  24kmh and cannot be manually turned off 200 marketing and cultureedit  co2 advertisingedit in the uk the advertising standards authority an independent body charged with policing the rules of the advertising industry ruled that a television advert for the toyota prius should not be broadcast again in the same form having breached rules concerning misleading advertising the advertisement stated that the prius emits up to one tonne less co2 per year while on-screen text included "1 tonne of co2 less than an equivalent family vehicle with a diesel engine average calculated on 20,000 km a year points of contention were the vehicles chosen for comparison whether up to one tonne less adequately communicated that reductions could be lower and whether the distance used was appropriate 20,000km per year is around a us cars average annual driving distance while a uk cars is 13,440km 201 political symbolismedit the large number of prius-owning progressive celebrities in 2002 prompted the the washington post to dub hybrids hollywoods latest politically correct status symbol 202 conservatives called prius patriots also drive the cars because they want to contribute to reducing us dependence on foreign oil 203 a 2007 san francisco chronicle article said prius progressives were becoming an archetype with american conservative commentator rush limbaugh opining that these liberals think theyre ahead of the game on these things and theyre just suckers 204 in july 2007 the new york times published an article using data from cnw marketing research finding that 57 of prius buyers said their main reason for buying was that it makes a statement about me while just 37 cited fuel economy as a prime motivator 205 shortly afterwards washington post columnist robert samuelson coined the term prius politics to describe a situation where the drivers desire to show off is a stronger motivator than the desire to curb greenhouse gas emissions 206 some conservatives promote use of the toyota prius and other hybrid cars for example jim road from what would jesus drive encouraged people to drive hybrid cars because of the damage that large suvs and faster cars can do to others 207 former central intelligence agency cia chief r james woolsey jr drives a prius because of its low fuel consumption woolsey noted the volatility of the middle east coupled with anti-us sentiment in much of the region noting that the high percentage of oil drilled in the middle east gives vast profits to middle eastern regimes woolsey believes that it is a patriotic obligation to drive more efficient vehicles in a motor trend magazine article woolsey stated that those oil profits find their way to terrorist groups like al-qaeda meaning that americans who buy inefficient vehicles would in effect be indirectly funding terrorism were paying for both sides in this war and thats not a good long-term strategy said woolsey i have a bumper sticker on the back of my prius that reads bin laden hates this car 208 darpa driverless editionedit a driverless version of the prius was one of six cars to finish the 2007 darpa urban challenge 209 motorsportsedit a racing version of the car took class pole position 210 and finished sixth at the 2012 fuji gt 500km 211 government and corporate incentivesedit there have been a number of governments with incentives intended to encourage hybrid car sales in some countries including the us and canada some rebate incentives have been exhausted while other countries such as the united kingdom sweden belgium and the netherlands have various or alternative incentives to purchasing a hybrid vehicle several us companies offer employees incentives bank of america will reimburse us$3,000 on the purchase of new hybrid vehicles to full- and part-time associates working more than 20 hours per week 212 google 213 software company hyperion solutions 214 and organic food and drink producer clif bar  co 212 offer employees a us$5,000 credit toward their purchase of certain hybrid vehicles including the prius integrated archive systems a palo alto it company offers a us$10,000 subsidy toward the purchase of hybrid vehicles to full-time employees employed more than one year 212 travelers companies a large insurance company offers hybrid owners a 10 discount on auto insurance in most us states 215 the farmers insurance group offers a similar discount of up to 10 in most us states 212 in june 2015 the prius started use a general purpose patrol car of the national police of ukraine in return for ukrainian emissions permits under the kyoto
