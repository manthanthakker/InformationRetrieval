include four stages encoding storage retrieval and processing in the area of social psychology social cognition refers to a specific approach in which these processes are studied according to the methods of cognitive psychology and information processing theory according to this view social cognition is a level of analysis that aims to understand social psychological phenomena by investigating the cognitive processes that underlie them 1 the major concerns of the approach are the processes involved in the perception judgment and memory of social stimuli the effects of social and affective factors on information processing and the behavioral and interpersonal consequences of cognitive processes this level of analysis may be applied to any content area within social psychology including research on intrapersonal interpersonal intragroup and intergroup processes however the term social cognition has also been used in multiple areas in psychology and cognitive neurosciencein these areas the term social cognition is most often used to refer to various social abilities disrupted in autism 2 schizophrenia 3 and other disorders 4 in cognitive neuroscience the biological basis of social cognition is investigated 5 6 7 developmental psychologists study the development of social cognition abilities 8  contents 1 historical development 2 social schemas 3 cultural differences 4

early 1970s and is now the dominant model and approach in mainstream social psychology 9 common to social cognition theories is the idea that information is represented in the brain as cognitive elements such as schemas attributions or stereotypes a focus on how these cognitive elements are processed is often employed social cognition therefore applies and extends many themes theories and paradigms from cognitive psychology that can be identified in reasoning representativeness heuristic base rate fallacy and confirmation bias attention automaticity and priming and memory schemas primacy and recency it is likely that social psychology has always had a more cognitive than general psychology approach as it traditionally discussed internal mental states such as beliefs and desires when mainstream psychology was dominated by behaviorism 10 a notable theory of social cognition is social schema theory although this is not the basis of all social cognition studies for example see attribution theory 10 it has been suggested that other disciplines in social psychology such as social identity theory and social representations may be seeking to explain largely the same phenomena as social cognition and that these different disciplines might be merged into a coherent integrated whole 11 a parallel paradigm has arisen in the study of action termed motor cognition which is concerned with understanding the representation of action and the associated process social schemasedit social schema theory builds on and uses terminology from schema theory in cognitive psychology which describes how ideas or concepts are represented in the brain and how they are categorized according to this view when we see or think of a concept a mental representation or schema is activated bringing to mind other information which is linked to the original concept by association this activation often happens unconsciously as a result of activating such schemas judgements are formed which go beyond the information actually available since many of the associations the schema evokes extend outside the given information this may influence social cognition and behaviour regardless of whether these judgements are accurate or not for example if an individual is introduced as a teacher then a teacher schema may be activated subsequently we might associate this person with wisdom or authority or past experiences of teachers that we remember and consider important when a schema is more accessible this means that it can be more quickly activated and used in a particular situation two cognitive processes that increase the accessibility of schemas are salience and priming salience is the degree to which a particular social object stands out relative to other social objects in a situation the higher the salience of an object the more likely that schemas for that object will be made accessible for example if there is one female in a group of seven males female gender schemas may be more accessible and influence the groups thinking and behavior toward the female group member 10 priming refers to any experience immediately prior to a situation that causes a schema to be more accessible for example watching a scary movie late at night might increase the accessibility of frightening schemas increasing the likelihood that a person will perceive shadows and background noises as potential threats social cognition researchers are interested in how new information is integrated into pre-established schemas especially when that information contrasts with the existing schema 12 for example a student may have a pre-established schema that all teachers are assertive and bossy after encountering a teacher who is timid and shy a social cognition researcher might be interested in how the student will integrate this new information with hisher existing teacher schema pre-established schemas tend to guide attention to new information as people selectively attend to information that is consistent with the schema and ignore information that is inconsistent this is referred to as a confirmation bias sometimes inconsistent information is sub-categorized and stored away as a special case leaving the original schema intact without any alterations this is referred to as subtyping social cognition researchers are also interested in studying the regulation of activated schemas it is believed that the situational activation of schemas is automatic meaning that it is outside individual conscious control in many situations however the schematic information that has been activated may be in conflict with the social norms of the situation in which case an individual is motivated to inhibit the influence of the schematic information on their thinking and social behavior whether a person will successfully regulate the application of the activated schemas is dependent on individual differences in self-regulatory ability and the presence of situational impairments to executive control high self-regulatory ability and the lack of situational impairments on executive functioning increase the likelihood that individuals will successfully inhibit the influence of automatically activated schemas on their thinking and social behavior however when people stop suppressing the influence of the unwanted thoughts a rebound effect can occur where the thought becomes hyper-accessible cultural differencesedit social psychologists have become increasingly interested in the influence of culture on social cognition 13 although people of all cultures use schemas to understand the world the content of schemas has been found to differ for individuals based on their cultural upbringing for example one study interviewed a scottish settler and a bantu herdsman from swaziland and compared their schemas about cattle 14 because cattle are essential to the lifestyle of the bantu people the bantu herdsmens schemas for cattle were far more extensive than the schemas of the scottish settler the bantu herdsmen was able to distinguish his cattle from dozens of others while the scottish settler was not studies have found that culture influences social cognition in other ways too in fact cultural influences have been found to shape some of the basic ways in which people automatically perceive and think about their environment 13 for example a number of studies have found that people who grow up in east asian cultures such as china and japan tend to develop holistic thinking styles whereas people brought up in western cultures like australia and the usa tend to develop analytic thinking styles 15 16 the typically eastern holistic thinking style is a type of thinking in which people focus on the overall context and the ways in which objects relate to each other 15 for example if an easterner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling then heshe might scan everyones face in the class and then use this information to judge how the individual is feeling 17 on the other hand the typically western analytic thinking style is a type of thinking style in which people focus on individual objects and neglect to consider the surrounding context 16 for example if a westerner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling then he or she might focus only on the classmates face in order to make the judgment 17 nisbett  2003 suggested that cultural differences in social cognition may stem from the various philosophical traditions of the east ie confucianism and buddhism versus the greek philosophical traditions ie of aristotle and plato of the west 13 however recent research indicates that differences in social cognition may originate from physical differences in the environments of the two cultures one study found that scenes from japanese cities were busier than those in the usa as they contain more objects which compete for attention in this study the eastern holistic thinking style and focus on the overall context was attributed to the busier nature of the japanese physical environment 18 social cognitive neuroscienceedit early interest in the relationship between brain function and social cognition includes the case of phineas gage whose behaviour was reported to have changed after an accident damaged one or both of his frontal lobes more recent neuropsychological studies have shown that brain injuries disrupt social cognitive processes for example damage to the frontal lobes can affect emotional responses to social stimuli  19 20 21 and performance on theory of mind tasks 22 23 in the temporal lobe damage to the fusiform gyrus can lead to the inability to recognize faces people with psychological disorders such as autism 2 psychosis 3 24 mood disorder 25 williams syndrome antisocial personality disorder 4 fragile x and turners syndrome 26 show differences in social behavior compared to their unaffected peers parents with posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd show disturbances in at least one aspect of social cognition namely joint attention with their young children only after a laboratory-induced relational stressor as compared to healthy parents without ptsd 27 however whether social cognition is underpinned by domain-specific neural mechanisms is still an open issue 28 there is now an expanding research field examining how such conditions may bias cognitive processes involved in social interaction or conversely how such biases may lead to the symptoms associated with the condition the development of social cognitive processes in infants and children has also been researched extensively see developmental psychology for example it has been suggested that some aspects of psychological processes that promote social behavior such as facial recognition may be innate consistent with this very young babies recognize and selectively respond to social stimuli such as the voice face and scent of their mother 29 see alsoedit situated
