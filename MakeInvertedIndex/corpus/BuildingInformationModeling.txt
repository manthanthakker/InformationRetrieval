the concept of bim has existed since the 1970s 1 2 3 the term building model in the sense of bim as used today was first used in papers in the mid-1980s in a 1985 paper by simon ruffle eventually published in 1986 4 and later in a 1986 paper by robert aish 5 - then at gmw computers ltd developer of rucaps software - referring to the softwares use at londons heathrow airport 6 the term building information model first appeared in a 1992 paper by ga van nederveen and f p tolman 7 however the terms building information model and building information modeling including the acronym bim did not become popularly used until some 10 years later in 2002 autodesk released a white paper entitled building information modeling 8 and other software vendors also started to assert their involvement in the field 9 by hosting contributions from autodesk bentley systems and graphisoft plus other industry observers in 2003 10 jerry laiserin helped popularize and standardize the term as a common name for the digital representation of the building process 11 facilitating exchange and interoperability of information in digital format had previously been offered under differing terminology by graphisoft as virtual building bentley systems as integrated project models and by autodesk or vectorworks as building information modeling as graphisoft had been developing such solutions for longer than its competitors laiserin regarded its archicad as then one of the most mature bim solutions on the market 12 but also highlighted the pioneering role of applications such as rucaps sonata and reflex 13 on 23 june 2016 the uks royal academy of engineering presented its prince philip gold medal to jonathan ingram the developer of sonata and reflex for his pioneering work on bim 14 following its launch in 1987 archicad became regarded by some as the first implementation of bim 15 16 as it was the first cad product on a personal computer able to create both 2d and 3d geometry as well as the first commercial bim product for personal computers 15 17 18 definitionedit the us national building information model standard project committee has the following definition traditional building design was largely reliant upon two-dimensional technical drawings plans elevations sections etc building information modeling extends this beyond 3d augmenting the three primary spatial dimensions width height and depth with time as the fourth dimension  4d 20 and cost as the fifth  5d 21 bim therefore covers more than just geometry it also covers spatial relationships light analysis geographic information and quantities and properties of building components for example manufacturers details bim involves representing a design as combinations of objects  vague and undefined generic or product-specific solid shapes or void-space oriented like the shape of a room that carry their geometry relations and attributes bim design tools allow extraction of different views from a building model for drawing production and other uses these different views are automatically consistent being based on a single definition of each object instance 22 bim software also defines objects parametrically that is the objects are defined as parameters and relations to other objects so that if a related object is amended dependent ones will automatically also change 22 each model element can carry attributes for selecting and ordering them automatically providing cost estimates as well as material tracking and ordering 22 for the professionals involved in a project bim enables a virtual information model to be handed from the design team architects landscape architects surveyors civil structural and building services engineers etc to the main contractor and subcontractors and then on to the owneroperator each professional adds discipline-specific data to the single shared model this reduces information losses that traditionally occurred when a new team takes ownership of the project and provides more extensive information to owners of complex structures bim throughout the project life-cycleedit use of bim goes beyond the planning and design phase of the project extending throughout the building life cycle supporting processes including cost management construction management project management and facility operation management of building information modelsedit building information models span the whole concept-to-occupation time-span to ensure efficient management of information processes throughout this span a bim manager also sometimes defined as a virtual design-to-construction vdc project manager  vdcpm might be appointed the bim manager is retained by a design build team on the clients behalf from the pre-design phase onwards to develop and to track the object-oriented bim against predicted and measured performance objectives supporting multi-disciplinary building information models that drive analysis schedules take-off and logistics 23 24 companies are also now considering developing bims in various levels of detail since depending on the application of bim more or less detail is needed and there is varying modeling effort associated with generating building information models at different levels of detail 25 bim in construction managementedit participants in the building process is constantly challenged to deliver successful projects despite tight budgets limited manpower accelerated schedules and limited or conflicting information the significant disciplines such as architectural structural and mep designs should be well coordinated as two things cant take place at the same place and time building information modeling aids in collision detection at the initial stage identifying the exact location of discrepancies the bim concept envisages virtual construction of a facility prior to its actual physical construction in order to reduce uncertainty improve safety work out problems and simulate and analyze potential impacts 26 sub-contractors from every trade can input critical information into the model before beginning construction with opportunities to pre-fabricate or pre-assemble some systems off-site waste can be minimised on-site and products delivered on a just-in-time basis rather than being stock-piled on-site 26 quantities and shared properties of materials can be extracted easily scopes of work can be isolated and defined systems assemblies and sequences can be shown in a relative scale with the entire facility or group of facilities bim also prevents errors by enabling conflict or clash detection whereby the computer model visually highlights to the team where parts of the building eg structural frame and building services pipes or ducts may wrongly intersect bim in facility operationedit bim can bridge the information loss associated with handling a project from design team to construction team and to building owneroperator by allowing each group to add to and reference back to all information they acquire during their period of contribution to the bim model this can yield benefits to the facility owner or operator for example a building owner may find evidence of a leak in his building rather than exploring the physical building he may turn to the model and see that water valve is located in the suspect location he could also have in the model the specific valve size manufacturer part number and any other information ever researched in the past pending adequate computing power such problems were initially addressed by leite and akinci when developing a vulnerability representation of facility contents and threats for supporting the identification of vulnerabilities in building emergencies 27 dynamic information about the building such as sensor measurements and control signals from the building systems can also be incorporated within bim software to support analysis of building operation and maintenance 28 bim in land administration and cadastreedit bim can potentially offer some benefits for managing stratified cadastral spaces in urban built environments the first benefit would be enhancing visual communication of interweaved stacked and complex cadastral spaces for non-specialists the rich amount of spatial and semantic information about physical structures inside models can aid comprehension of cadastral boundaries providing an unambiguous delineation of ownership rights responsibilities and restrictions additionally using bim to manage cadastral information could advance current land administration systems from a 2d-based and analogue data environment into a 3d digital intelligent interactive and dynamic one 29 bim could also unlock value in the cadastral information by forming a bridge between that information and the interactive lifecycle and management of buildings 30 bim softwareedit the first software tools developed for modelling buildings emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s and included workstation products such as chuck eastmans building description system and glide rucaps sonata and reflex the early applications and the hardware needed to run them were expensive which limited widespread adoption archicads radar ch released in 1984 was the first modelling software made available on a personal computer 17 due to the complexity of gathering all the relevant information when working with bim on a building project some companies have developed software designed specifically to work in a bim framework these packages eg bentley aecosim building designer archicad magicad tekla structures autodesk revit synchro pro vectorworks trimble sketchup differ from architectural drafting tools such as autocad by allowing the addition of further information time cost manufacturers details sustainability and maintenance information etc to the building model there is a bim module in open source cad software freecad non-proprietary or open bim standardsedit bim is often associated with industry foundation classes ifcs and aecxml  data structures for representing information ifcs have been developed by buildingsmart the former international alliance for interoperability as a neutral non-proprietary or open standard for sharing bim data among different software applications some proprietary data structures have been developed by cad vendors incorporating bim into their software poor software interoperability has long been regarded as an obstacle to industry efficiency in general and to bim adoption in particular in august 2004 a us national institute of standards and technology nist report 31 conservatively estimated that $15.8 billion was lost annually by the us capital facilities industry due to inadequate interoperability arising from the highly fragmented nature of the industry the industrys continued paperbased business practices a lack of standardization and inconsistent technology adoption among stakeholders an early example of a nationally approved bim standard is the aisc american institute of steel construction-approved cis/2 standard a non-proprietary standard with its roots in the uk there have been attempts at creating a bim for older pre-existing facilities they generally reference key metrics such as the facility condition index fci the validity of these models will need to be monitored over time because trying to model a building constructed in say 1927 requires numerous assumptions about design standards building codes construction methods materials etc and therefore is far more complex than building a bim at time of initial design international bim developmentsedit asiaedit hong kongedit the hong kong institute of building information modelling hkibim was established in 2009 the

until the late 2000s that the korean industry paid attention to bim the first industry-level bim conference was held in april 2008 after which bim has been spread very rapidly since 2010 the korean government has been gradually increasing the scope of bim-mandated projects mcgraw hill published a detailed report in 2012 on the status of bim adoption and implementation in south korea 37 united arab emiratesedit dubai municipality issued a circular  196 in 2014 mandating bim use for buildings of a certain size height or type the one page circular initiated strong interest in bim and the market responded in preparation for more guidelines and direction in 2015 the municipality issued another circular  207 titled regarding the expansion of applying the bim on buildings and facilities in the emirate of dubai which made bim mandatory on more projects by reducing the minimum size and height requirement for projects requiring bim this second circular drove bim adoption further with

that canada will be successful in its movement towards a better built environment supported through open and internationally compatible standards for bim united states of americaedit the associated general contractors of america and us contracting firms have developed various working definitions of bim that describe it generally as although the concept of bim and relevant processes are being explored by contractors architects and developers alike the term itself has been questioned and debated 64 with alternatives including virtual building environment vbe and virtual design and construction vdc also considered bim is seen to be closely related to integrated project delivery ipd where the primary motive is to bring the teams together early on in the project 65 a full implementation of bim also requires the project teams to collaborate from the inception stage and formulate model sharing and ownership contract documents the american institute of architects has defined bim as a model-based technology linked with a database of project information 3 and this reflects the general reliance on database technology as the foundation in the future structured text documents such as specifications may be able to be searched and linked to regional national and international standards africaedit nigeriaedit bim has the potential to play a vital role in the nigerian aec sector in addition to its potential clarity and transparency it may help promote standardization across the industry for instance utiome 66 suggests that in conceptualizing a bim-based knowledge transfer framework from industrialized economies to urban construction projects in developing nations generic bim objects can benefit from rich building information within specification parameters in product libraries and used for efficient streamlined design and construction similarly an assessment of the current state of the art by kori 67 found that medium and large firms were leading the adoption of bim in the industry smaller firms were less advanced with respect to process and policy adherence south africaedit the south african bim institute established in may 2015 aims to enable technical experts to discuss digital construction solutions that can be adopted by professionals working within the construction sector its initial task was to promote the sa bim protocol there are currently no mandated or national best practice bim standards or protocols in south africa organisations implement company-specific bim standards and protocols at best there are isolated examples of cross-industry alliances these company-specific standards may be difficult to share or replicate and so hinder design collaboration furthermore there is little interest from local government agencies professional bodies and voluntary organisations to drive the development of national bim standards and protocols despite a vibrant client base south africa thus lags behind other countries in bim implementation and practice 68 oceaniaedit australiaedit in february 2016 infrastructure australia recommended governments should make the use of building information modelling bim mandatory for the design of large-scale complex infrastructure projects in support of a mandatory rollout the australian government should commission the australasian procurement and construction council working with industry to develop appropriate guidance around the adoption and use of bim and common standards and protocols to be applied when using bim 69 new zealandedit in 2015 many projects in the rebuilding of christchurch were being assembled in detail on a computer using bim well before workers set foot on the site the new zealand government started a bim acceleration committee as part of a productivity partnership with the goal of 20 per cent more efficiency in the construction industry by 2020 70 anticipated future potentialedit bim is a relatively new technology in an industry typically slow to adopt change yet many early adopters are confident that bim will grow to play an even more crucial role in building documentation proponents claim that bim offers bim also contains most of the data needed for building energy performance analysis the building properties in bim can be used to automatically create the input file for building energy simulation and save a significant amount of time and effort 71 moreover automation of this process reduce errors and mismatches in the building energy simulation process green building xml gbxml is an emerging schema a subset of the building information modeling efforts focused on green building design and operation gbxml is used as input in several energy simulation engines 72 with the development of modern computer technology a large number of building energy simulation tools are available when choosing which simulation tool to use the user must consider the tools accuracy and reliability considering the building information they have at hand which will serve as input for the tool yezioro dong and leite 73 developed an artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation results and found that more detailed simulation tools have the best simulation performance in terms of heating and cooling electricity consumption within 3 of mean absolute error
