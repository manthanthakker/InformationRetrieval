and also when it is necessary to distinguish the united kingdom currency from other currencies with the same name otherwise the term pound is normally used the currency name is sometimes abbreviated to just sterling particularly in the wholesale financial markets but not when referring to specific amounts for example payment is accepted in sterling but never these cost five sterling the abbreviations ster or stg are sometimes used the term british pound is commonly used in less formal contexts although it is not an official name of the currency the pound sterling is also referred to as cable amongst forex traders the origins of this term are attributed to the fact that in the 1800s the dollarpound sterling exchange rate was transmitted via transatlantic cable forex brokers are sometimes referred to as cable dealers 10 there is apparent convergence of opinioncitation needed regarding the origin of the term pound sterling toward its derivation from the name of a small norman silver coin 11 and away from its association with easterlings germanic traders or other etymologies 12 13 hence the oxford english dictionary and sources derived therefrom 14 15 state that the most plausible etymology is derivation from the old english steorra for star with the added diminutive suffix -ling to mean little star and to refer to a silver penny of the english normans 11 as another established source notes 16 the compound expression was then derived silver coins known as sterlings were issued in the saxon kingdoms 240 of them being minted from a pound of silver hence large payments came to be reckoned in pounds of sterlings a phrase later shortened however the perceived narrow window of the issuance of this coin and the fact that coin designs changed frequently in the period in question led philip grierson to reject this in favour of a more complex theory 17 another argument that the hanseatic league was the origin for both the origin of its definition and manufacture and in its name is that the german name for the baltic is ost see or east sea and from this the baltic merchants were called osterlings or easterlings in 1260 henry iii granted them a charter of protection and because the leagues money was not frequently debased like that of england english traders stipulated to be paid in pounds of the easterlings which was contracted to sterling 18 and land for their kontor the steelyard of london which by the 1340s was also called easterlings hall or esterlingeshalle 19 for further discussion of the etymology of sterling see sterling silver the currency sign for the pound sign is  which is usually written with a single cross-bar as on sterling bank notes though a version with a double cross-bar  is also sometimes seen this symbol derives from medieval latin documents the roman words libra solidus and denarius sd referred to pounds shillings and pence 16 in the british pre-decimal duodecimal currency system and the black-letter l was the abbreviation for libra the basic roman unit of weight the iso 4217 currency code is gbp occasionally the abbreviation ukp is used but this is non-standard because the iso 3166 country code for

pence so traders may refer to pence sterling gbx sometimes gbp when listing stock prices a common slang term for the pound sterling or pound is quid which is singular and plural except in the common phrase quids in the term may have come via italian immigrants from scudo the name for a number of coins used in italy until the 19th century or from latin quid via the common phrase quid pro quo literally what for what or figuratively an equal exchange or substitution 20 subdivisions and other unitsedit decimal coinageedit since decimalisation in 1971 see decimal day the pound has been divided into 100 pence until 1981 described on the coinage as new pence the symbol for the penny is p hence an amount such as 50p £0.50 properly pronounced fifty pence is more colloquially quite often pronounced fifty pee fɪfti pi this also helped to distinguish between new and old pence amounts during the changeover to the decimal system a decimal halfpenny was issued until 1984 in an attempt to stop inflation but was removed due to having a higher cost to manufacture than its face value 21 pre-decimaledit prior to decimalisation the pound was divided into 20 shillings and each shilling into 12 pence making 240 pence to the pound the symbol for the shilling was snot from the first letter of the word but from the latin solidus the symbol for the penny was d from the french denier from the latin denarius the solidus and denarius were roman coins a mixed sum of shillings and pence such as 3 shillings and 6 pence was written as "3/6 or "3s 6d and spoken as three and six except for "1/1 "2/1 etc which were spoken as one and a penny two and a penny etc 5 shillings was written as "5s or more commonly "5 the stroke  indicating shillings is also known as a solidus and was originally an adaptation of the long s which represented that word various coin denominations had and in some cases continue to have special namessuch as crown farthing sovereign and guinea see coins of the pound sterling and list of british coins and banknotes for details by the 1950s coins of kings george iii george iv and william iv had disappeared from circulation but coins at least the penny bearing the head of any british king or queen from queen victoria onwards could be found in circulation silver coins were replaced by those in cupro-nickel in 1947 and by the 1960s the silver coins were rarely seen silvercupro-nickel shillings from any period after 1816 and florins  2 shillings remained as legal tender after decimalisation as 5p and 10p respectively until 1993 and are now officially demonetised historyedit the pound sterling is the worlds oldest currency still in use 7 anglo-saxonedit the pound was a unit of account in anglo-saxon england equal to 240 silver pennies and equivalent to one pound weight of silver it evolved into the modern british currency the pound sterling the accounting system of 4 farthings  1 penny 12 pence  1 shilling 20 shillings  1 pound was adopted from that introduced by charlemagne to the frankish empire see french livre the origins of sterling lie in the reign of king offa of mercia  757–796 who introduced the silver penny it copied the denarius of the new currency system of charlemagnes frankish empire as in the carolingian system 240 pennies weighed 1 pound corresponding to charlemagnes libra with the shilling corresponding to charlemagnes solidus and equal to 12d at the time of the pennys introduction it weighed 22.5 troy grains of fine silver  32 tower grains about 1.5 g indicating that the mercian pound weighed 5,400 troy grains the mercian pound became the basis of the tower pound which weighed 5,400 troy grains equivalent to 7,680 tower grains about 350g at this time the name sterling had yet to be acquired the penny swiftly spread throughout the other anglo-saxon kingdoms and became the standard coin of what was to become englandcitation needed medievaledit the early pennies were struck from fine silver as pure as was available however in 1158 a new coinage was introduced by king henry ii known as the tealby penny which was struck from 0.925  92.5 silver this became the standard until the 20th century and is today known as sterling silver named after its association with the currency sterling silver is harder than the 0.999  99.9 fine silver that was traditionally used and so sterling silver coins did not wear down as rapidly as fine silver coins the english currency was almost exclusively silver until 1344 when the gold noble was successfully introduced into circulation however silver remained the legal basis for sterling until 1816 during the time of henry iii the pound sterling equaled the pound weight tower 22 in the 28th year of edward i the tale pound or pound sterling first began to differ or come short of the pound weight tower from which it drew its origine and to which until now it was equal for by indenture of that year the pound weight was to contain twenty shillings and three-pence in tale 22:14 in the 27th year of edward iii the pound sterling was now but 4/5 of the pound weight or 9 oz 12 dwts tower 22:15by an act of 13 henry iv the pound weight of standard silver was to contain thirty shillings in tale or 1-1/2 pound sterling therefore the pound sterling reduced to 2/3 of a pound weight or 8 oz tower 22:18 the pound sterling was adjusted in weight several more times thereafter in the reign of henry iv  1399–1413 the penny was reduced in weight to 15 grains  0.97g of silver with a further reduction to 12 grains  0.78g in 1464 tudoredit during the reigns of henry viii and edward vi the silver coinage was drastically debased although the pound was redefined to the troy pound of 5,760 grains  373g in 1526 in 1544 a silver coinage was issued containing just one third silver and two thirds copperequating to .333 silver or 33.3 pure the result was a coin copper in appearance but relatively pale in colour in 1552 a new silver coinage was introduced struck in sterling silver however the pennys weight was reduced to 8 grains  0.52g meaning that 1 troy pound of sterling silver produced 60 shillings of coins this silver standard was known as the "60-shilling standard and lasted until 1601 when a "62-shilling standard was introduced reducing the pennys weight to  7 23⁄31 grains  0.50g throughout this period the size and value of the gold coinage fluctuated considerably unofficial gold standardedit in 1663 a new gold coinage was introduced based on the 22 carat fine guinea fixed in weight at  44 1⁄2 to the troy pound from 1670 this coins value varied considerably until 1717 when it was fixed at 21 shillings  21- 1.05 pounds 23 however despite the efforts of sir isaac newton master of the mint to reduce the guineas value this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver when compared to the valuations in other european countries british merchants sent silver abroad in payments whilst goods for export were paid for with gold as a consequence silver flowed out of the country and gold flowed in leading to a situation where great britain was effectively on a gold standard aggravating this outflow was the fact that silver was the only commodity accepted by china for exporting goods during this period from the mid-17th century around 28 million kilograms  62 million pounds of silver were received by china principally from european powers in exchange for chinese tea and other goods in order to trade with china great britain had to first trade with the other european nations to receive silver which led to the east india company redressing this trade imbalance through the indirect sale of opium to the chinese 24 domestic offtake further reduced silver in circulation as the improving fortunes of the merchant class led to increased demand for tablewares silversmiths had always regarded coinage as a source of raw material already government verified for fineness as a result sterling coins were being melted and fashioned into sterling silverware at an accelerating rate a 1697 act of parliament attempted to stem this tide by raising the minimum acceptable fineness on wrought plate from sterlings 92.5 to a new britannia silver standard of 95.83 product then made solely from melted coins would be found wanting when the silversmith took his wares to the assay office thus discouraging the melting of coins establishment of modern currencyedit the bank of england was founded in 1694 followed by the bank of scotland a year later both began to issue paper money currency of great britain  1707 and the united kingdom  1801edit the pound scots once had much the same value as the pound sterling but it suffered far higher devaluation until in the 17th century it was pegged to sterling at a value of 12 pounds scots  1 pound sterling in 1707 the kingdom of england and the kingdom of scotland merged to form the kingdom of great britain in accordance with the treaty of union the currency of great britain was sterling with the pound scots soon being replaced by sterling at the pegged value in 1801 great britain and the kingdom of ireland were united to form the united kingdom of great britain and ireland however the irish pound continued to exist and was not replaced by sterling until january 1826 the conversion rate had long been thirteen irish pounds to twelve pounds sterling use in the empireedit sterling circulated in much of the british empire in some parts it was used alongside local currencies for example the gold sovereign was legal tender in canada despite the use of the canadian dollar several colonies and dominions adopted the pound as their own currency these included australia barbados 25 british west africa cyprus fiji the irish free state jamaica new zealand south africa and southern rhodesia some of these retained parity with sterling throughout their existence eg the south african pound whilst others deviated from parity after the end of the gold standard eg the australian pound these currencies and others tied to sterling constituted the sterling area the original english colonies on mainland north america were not party to the sterling area because the above-mentioned silver shortage in england coincided with these colonies formative years as a result of equitable trade and rather less equitable piracy the spanish milled dollar became the most common coin within the english colonies gold standardedit during the american war of independence and napoleonic wars bank of england notes were legal tender and their value floated relative to gold the bank also issued silver tokens to alleviate the shortage of silver coins in 1816 the gold standard was adopted officially with the silver standard reduced to 66 shillings  66- £3 6s rendering silver coins a token issue ie not containing their value in precious metal in 1817 the sovereign was introduced valued at 20 shillings struck in 22carat gold it contained 113 grains  7.3g of gold and replaced the guinea as the standard british gold coin without changing the gold standard in 1825 the irish pound which had been pegged to sterling since 1801 at a rate of 13 irish pounds  12 pounds sterling was replaced at the same rate with sterling by the 19th century the pound sterling was widely accepted outside britain the american nellie bly carried bank of england notes on her 1889-1890 trip around the world in 72 days 26 during the late 19th and early 20th centuries many other countries adopted the gold standard as a consequence conversion rates between different currencies could be determined simply from the respective gold standards the pound sterling was equal to 4.85 united states dollars 5.25 canadian dollars 12.10 dutch guilders 26.28 french francs or equivalent currencies in the latin monetary union 20.43 german marks or 24.02 austro-hungarian krones discussions took place following the international monetary conference of 1867 in paris concerning the possibility of the uk joining the latin monetary union and a royal commission on international coinage examined the issues 27 resulting in a decision against joining monetary union the gold standard was suspended at the outbreak of the war in 1914 with bank of england and treasury notes becoming legal tender prior to world war i the united kingdom had one of the worlds strongest economies holding 40 of the worlds overseas investments however after the end of the war the country was indebted britain owed £850 million £37.3billion as of 2015 28 mostly to the united states with interest costing the country some 40 of all government spending 29 in an attempt to resume stability a variation on the gold standard was reintroduced in 1925 under which the currency was fixed to gold at its pre-war peg although people were only able to exchange their currency for gold bullion rather than for coins this was abandoned on 21 september 1931 during the great depression and sterling suffered an initial devaluation of some 25 30 bretton woodsedit in 1940 an agreement with the usa pegged the pound to the us dollar at a rate of £1  $4.03 only the year before it had been $4.86 31 this rate was maintained through the second world war and became part of the bretton woods system which governed post-war exchange rates under continuing economic pressure and despite months of denials that it would do so on 19 september 1949 the government devalued the pound by 30.5 to $2.80 the move prompted several other currencies to be devalued against the dollar the operation bernhard was the codename of a secret nazi plan devised during the second world war by the rsha and the ss to destabilise the british economy via economic warfare by flooding the global economy and the british empire with forged bank of england £5 £10 £20 and £50 notes in 1961 1964 and 1966 the pound came under renewed pressure since the exchange rate against the dollar was considered too high in the summer of 1966 with the value of the pound falling in the currency markets exchange controls were tightened by the wilson government among the measures tourists were banned from taking more than £50 out of the country in travellers cheques and remittances plus £15 in cash until the restriction was lifted in 1979 the pound was devalued by 14.3 to $2.40 on 18 november 1967 decimalisationedit until decimalisation amounts were stated in pounds shillings and pence with various widely understood notations the same amount was denoted by 32s 6d 32/6 £1 12s 6d £1/12/6 it was customary to specify some prices for example professional fees and auction prices for works of art in guineas one guinea was 21 shillings although guinea coins were no longer in use formal parliamentary proposals to decimalise sterling were first made in 1824 when sir john wrottesley mp for staffordshire asked in the british house of commons whether consideration had been given to decimalising the currency 32 wrottesley raised the issue in the house of commons again in 1833 33 and it was again raised by john bowring mp for kilmarnock burghs in 1847 34 whose efforts led to the introduction in 1848 of what was in effect the first decimal coin in the united kingdom the florin valued at one-tenth of a pound sterling however full decimalisation was resisted although the florin coin re-designated as ten new pence survived the transfer to a full decimal system in 1971 with examples surviving in british coinage until 1993 j b smith mp for stirling burghs raised the issue of full decimalisation again in parliament in 1853 35 resulting in the chancellor of the exchequer william gladstone announcing soon afterwards that the great question of a decimal coinage was now under serious consideration 36 a full proposal for the decimalisation of sterling was then tabled in the house of commons in june 1855 by william brown mp for lancashire southern with the suggestion that the pound sterling be divided into one thousand parts each called a mil or alternatively a farthing as the pound was then equivalent to 960 farthings which could easily be rounded up to one thousand farthings in the new system 37 this did not result in the conversion of the pound sterling into a decimal system but it was agreed to establish a royal commission to look into the issue 38 however largely due to the hostility to decimalisation of two of the appointed commissioners lord overstone a banker and john hubbard governor of the bank of england decimalisation in britain was effectively quashed for over a hundred years 39 however the pound sterling was decimalised in various british colonial territories before the united kingdom and in several cases using william browns proposal that the pound be divided into 1000 parts called mils this included hong kong from 1863 to 1866 40 cyprus from 1955 until 1960 and continued on the island as the division of the cypriot pound until 1983 and the palestine mandate from 1926 until 1948 41 towards the end of the second world war various attempts to decimalise the pound sterling in the united kingdom were made until in 1966 the british government decided to include in the queens speech a plan to convert the pound into a decimal currency 42 as a result of this on 15 february 1971 the uk decimalised the pound sterling replacing the shilling and penny with a single subdivision the new penny for example a price tag of £1 12s 6d became £1.62 1⁄2 the word new was omitted from coins minted after 1981 free-floating poundedit with the breakdown of the bretton woods system the pound floated from august 1971 onwards at first it appreciated a little rising to almost $2.65 in march 1972 from $2.42 the upper bound of the band in which it had been fixed the sterling area effectively ended at this time when the majority of its members also chose to float freely against the pound and the dollar 1976 sterling crisisedit james callaghan became prime minister in 1976 he was immediately told the economy was facing huge problems according to documents released in 2006 by the national archives 43 the effects of the 1973 oil crisis were still being felt with inflation rising to over 27 in 1975 44 financial markets were beginning to believe the pound was overvalued and in april that year the wall street journal advised the sale of sterling investments in the face of high taxes in a story that ended with goodbye great britain it was nice knowing you 45 at the time the uk government was running a budget deficit and labours strategy emphasised high public spending callaghan was told there were three possible outcomes a disastrous free fall in sterling an internationally unacceptable siege economy or a deal with key allies to prop up the pound while painful economic reforms were put in place the us government feared the crisis could endanger nato and the european economic community eec and in light of this the us treasury set out to force domestic policy changes in november 1976 the international monetary fund imf announced the conditions for a loan including deep cuts in public expenditure 46 1979–89edit the conservative party was elected to office in 1979 on a programme of fiscal austerity initially the pound rocketed moving above us$2.40 as interest rates rose in response to the monetarist policy of targeting money supply the high exchange rate was widely blamed for the deep recession of 1981 sterling fell sharply after 1980 at its lowest the pound stood at just $1.03 in march 1985 before rising to $1.70 in december 1989 47 following the deutsche markedit in 1988 margaret thatchers chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson decided that the pound should shadow the west german deutsche mark with the unintended result of a rapid rise in inflation as the economy boomed due to inappropriately low interest rates for ideological reasons the conservative government declined to use alternative mechanisms to control the explosion of credit for this reason former prime minister edward heath referred to lawson as a one club golfer 48 following german re-unification in 1990 the reverse held true as high borrowing costs to fund eastern reconstruction a need exacerbated by the political choice to make the ostmark equivalent to the deutsche mark dm meant rates in other countries shadowing the dm especially the uk were far too high relative to domestic circumstances leading to a housing decline and recession following the european currency unitedit on 8 october 1990 the conservative government third thatcher ministry decided to join the european exchange rate mechanism erm with the pound set at dm2.95 however the country was forced to withdraw from the system on black wednesday  16 september 1992 as britains economic performance made the exchange rate unsustainable speculator george soros infamously made approximately us$1 billion from shorting the pound black wednesday saw interest rates jump from 10 to 15 in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the pound from falling below the erm limits the exchange rate fell to dm2.20 those who had argued 49 for a lower gbpdm exchange rate were vindicated as the cheaper pound encouraged exports and contributed to the economic prosperity of the 1990s following inflation targetsedit in 1997 the newly elected labour government handed over day-to-day control of interest rates to the bank of england a policy that had originally been advocated by the liberal democrats 50 the bank is now responsible for setting its base rate of interest so as to keep inflation in the consumer price index cpi very close to 2 should cpi inflation be more than one percentage point above or below the target the governor of the bank of england is required to write an open letter to the chancellor of the exchequer explaining the reasons for this and the measures which will be taken to bring this measure of inflation back in line with the 2 target on 17 april 2007 cpi inflation was reported at 3.1 inflation of the retail prices index was 4.8 accordingly and for the first time the governor had to write publicly to the government explaining why inflation was more than one percentage point higher than its target 51 euroedit as a member of the european union the united kingdom could have adopted the euro as its currency however the subject was always politically controversial and the uk negotiated an opt-out on this issue the 2016 referendum which started the process of united kingdom withdrawal from the european union makes adoption of the euro highly unlikely in the near future in 2007 gordon brown then chancellor of the exchequer ruled out membership for the foreseeable future saying that the decision not to join had been right for britain and for europe 52 the government of former prime minister tony blair had pledged to hold a public referendum to decide on membership should five economic tests be met to ensure that adoption of the euro would be in the national interest in addition to these internal national criteria the uk would have to meet the european unions economic convergence criteria maastricht criteria before being allowed to adopt the euro the conservative and liberal democrat coalition government  2010-2015 ruled out joining the euro for that parliamentary term currentlywhen the uks annual government deficit as a percentage of the gdp is above the defined threshold the idea of replacing the pound with the euro was always controversial with the british public partly because of the pounds identity as a symbol of british sovereignty and because it would according to many critics have led to suboptimal interest rates harming the british economy 53 in december 2008 the results of a bbc poll of 1000 people suggested that 71 would vote no to the euro 23 would vote yes to joining the european single currency while 6 said they were unsure 54 the pound did not join the second european exchange rate mechanism erm ii after the euro was created denmark and the uk have opt-outs from entry to the euro technically every other eu nation must eventually sign up the scottish conservative party claimed that there was an issue for scotland in that the adoption of the euro would mean the end of nationally distinctive banknotes as the euro banknotes do not have national designs 55 before the no vote in the scottish independence referendum in 2014 the scottish national party affirmed that the euro would not be the national currency of an independent scotland on 1 january 2008 the british sovereign bases on cyprus akrotiri and dhekelia began using the euro along with the republic of cyprus 56 recent exchange ratesedit the pound and the euro fluctuate in value against one another although there may be correlation between movements in their respective exchange rates with other currencies such as the us dollar inflation concerns in the uk led the bank of england to raise interest rates in late 2006 and 2007 this caused the pound to appreciate against other major currencies and with the us dollar depreciating at the same time the pound hit a 15-year high against the us dollar on 18 april 2007 reaching us$2 the day before for the first time since 1992 the pound and many other currencies continued to appreciate against the dollar sterling hit a 26-year high of us$2.1161 on 7 november 2007 as the dollar fell worldwide 59 from mid-2003 to mid-2007 the poundeuro rate remained range-bound within  5 of €1.45 60 following the global financial crisis in late 2008 the pound depreciated sharply reaching £1 per $1.38 us on 23 january 2009 61 and falling below €1.25 against the euro in april 2008 62 a further decline occurred during the remainder of 2008 most dramatically on 29 december when its euro rate hit an all-time low at €1.0219 while its us dollar rate depreciated 63 64 the pound appreciated in early 2009 reaching a peak against the euro in mid-july of €1.17 the following months the pound remained broadly steady against the euro with the pounds current  27 may 2011 value at €1.15 and us$1.65 on 5 march 2009 the bank of england announced that it would pump £75 billion of new capital into the british economy through a process known as quantitative easing this was the first time in the united kingdoms history that this measure had been used although the banks governor mervyn king suggested it was not an experiment 65 the process saw the bank of england creating new money for itself which it then used to purchase assets such as government bonds secured commercial paper or corporate bonds 66 the initial amount stated to be created through this method was £75 billion although chancellor of the exchequer alistair darling had given permission for up to £150 billion to be created if necessary 67 it was expected that the process would occur over a period of three months with results only likely in the long term 65 by 5 november 2009 some £175 billion had been injected using quantitative easing and the effectiveness of the process remained less successful in the long term in july 2012 the final increase in the asset purchases finance meant qe had peaked at £375 billion then holding solely uk government bonds representing one third of the uk national debt 68 the result of the 2016 uk referendum on eu membership caused a major decline in the pound against other world currencies as the future of international trade relationships and domestic political leadership became unclear 69 the referendum result weakened sterling against euro overnight by 5 the night before the vote £1 was trading for €1.30 on the day following the referendum when the result was clear £1 was trading at €1.23 by october 2016 the exchange rate was €1.12 to the pound a fall of 14 since the referendum 70 against the us dollar meanwhile the pound fell from $1.466 to $1.3694 when the referendum result was

falling below the 2 target rate 66 mervyn king the governor of the bank of england also had suggested there were no other monetary options left as interest rates had already been cut to their lowest level ever  0.5 and it was unlikely that they would be cut further 67 the inflation rate per annum rose in following years reaching 5.2 based on consumer price index in september 2011 then decreased to around 2.5 in the following year 72 coinsedit pre-decimal coinsedit the silver penny plural pence abbreviation d was the principal and often the only coin in circulation from the 8th century until the 13th century although some fractions of the penny were struck see farthing and halfpenny it was more common to find pennies cut into halves and quarters to provide smaller change very few gold coins were struck with the gold penny worth 20 silver pence a rare example however in 1279 the groat worth 4d was introduced with the half groat following in 1344 1344 also saw the establishment of a gold coinage with the introduction after the failed gold florin of the noble worth six shillings and eight pence  6/8 ie 3 nobles to the pound together with the half and quarter noble reforms in 1464 saw a reduction in value of the coinage in both silver and gold with the noble renamed the ryal and worth 10- ie 2 to the pound and the angel introduced at the nobles old value of 6/8 the reign of henry vii saw the introduction of two important coins the shilling abbr s known as the testoon in 1487 and the pound known as the sovereign abbr  or l in 1489 in 1526 several new denominations of gold coins were added including the crown and half crown worth five shillings  5- and two shillings and six pence  2/6 two and six respectively henry viiis reign  1509–1547 saw a high level of debasement which continued into the reign of edward vi  1547–1553 this debasement was halted in 1552 and a new silver coinage was introduced including coins for 1d 2d 3d 4d and 6d 1- 2/6 and 5- in the reign of elizabeth i  1558–1603 silver  3⁄4d and  1 1⁄2d coins were added but these denominations did not last gold coins included the half-crown crown angel half-sovereign and sovereign elizabeths reign also saw the introduction of the horse-drawn screw press to produce the first milled coins following the succession of the scottish king james vi to the english throne a new gold coinage was introduced including the spur ryal  15- the unite  20- and the rose ryal  30- the laurel worth 20- followed in 1619 the first base metal coins were also introduced tin and copper farthings copper halfpenny coins followed in the reign of charles i during the english civil war a number of siege coinages were produced often in unusual denominations following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 the coinage was reformed with the ending of production of hammered coins in 1662 the guinea was introduced in 1663 soon followed by the  1⁄2 2 and 5 guinea coins the silver coinage consisted of denominations of 1d 2d 3d 4d and 6d 1- 2/6 and 5- due to the widespread export of silver in the 18th century the production of silver coins gradually came to a halt with the half crown and crown not issued after the 1750s the 6d and 1- stopping production in the 1780s in response copper 1d and 2d coins and a gold  1⁄3 guinea  7- were introduced in 1797 the copper penny was the only one of these coins to survive long to alleviate the shortage of silver coins between 1797 and 1804 the bank of england counterstamped spanish dollars  8 reales and other spanish and spanish colonial coins for circulation a small counterstamp of the kings head was used until 1800 these circulated at a rate of 4/9 for 8 reales after 1800 a rate of 5- for 8 reales was used the bank then issued silver tokens for 5- struck over spanish dollars in 1804 followed by tokens for 1/6 and 3- between 1811 and 1816 in 1816 a new silver coinage was introduced in denominations of 6d 1- 2/6 half-crown and 5- crown the crown was only issued intermittently until 1900 it was followed by a new gold coinage in 1817 consisting of 10- and £1 coins known as the half sovereign and sovereign the silver 4d coin was reintroduced in 1836 followed by the 3d in 1838 with the 4d coin issued only for colonial use after 1855 in 1848 the 2- florin was introduced followed by the short-lived double florin in 1887 in 1860 copper was replaced by bronze in the farthing quarter penny  1⁄4d halfpenny and penny during the first world war production of the half sovereign and sovereign was suspended and although the gold standard was later restored the coins saw little circulation thereafter in 1920 the silver standard maintained at .925 since 1552 was reduced to .500 in 1937 a nickel-brass 3d coin was introduced the last silver 3d coins were issued seven years later in 1947 the remaining silver coins were replaced with cupro-nickel with the exception of maundy coinage which was then restored to .925 inflation caused the farthing to cease production in 1956 and be demonetised in 1960 in the run-up to decimalisation the halfpenny and half-crown were demonetised in 1969 decimal coinsedit british coinage timeline 1968 the first decimal coins were introduced these were cupro-nickel 5p and 10p coins which were equivalent to and circulated alongside the one shilling coin and the two shilling or florin coin respectively 1969 the curved equilateral heptagonal cupro-nickel 50p coin replaced the 10- note 1971 the decimal coinage was completed when decimalisation came into effect in 1971 with the introduction of the bronze  1⁄2p 1p and 2p coins and the withdrawal of the 1d and 3d coins 1980 withdrawal of 6d coins which had circulated at a value of  2 1⁄2p 1982 the word new was dropped from the coinage and a 20p coin was introduced 1983 a £1 coin was introduced 1983 the  1⁄2p coin was last produced 1984 the  1⁄2p coin was demonetised 1990 the crown worth 25p was re-tariffed for future issues as a commemorative coin at £5 1990s the 5p 10p and 50p coins became smaller 1991 pre-decimal 1- coins which had continued to circulate with a value of 5p were demonetised in 1991 after the 5p coin became smaller at the same time larger first generation decimal 5p coins were demonetised 1992 bronze was replaced with copper-plated steel 1993 pre-decimal 2- coins or florin a legacy of the 1848 attempt at decimalisation were demonetised at the same time larger first generation decimal 10p coins were demonetised 1998 the bi-metallic £2 coin was introduced 2007 by now the value of copper in the pre-1992 1p and 2p coins which are 97 copper exceeded those coins face value to such an extent that melting down the coins by entrepreneurs was becoming worthwhile with a premium of up to 11 with smelting costs reducing this to around 4although this is illegal and the market value of copper has subsequently fallen dramatically from these earlier peaks 2012 the 5p and 10p coins were changed from cupro-nickel to nickel-plated steel 2014 it was announced that in 2017 the pound coin will change to a more secure twelve-sided coin to discourage forgery at present the oldest circulating coins in the uk are the 1p and 2p copper coins introduced in 1971 no other coins from before 1980 are in circulation before decimalisation a handful of change might have contained coins 100 or more years old bearing any of five monarchs heads in april 2008 an extensive redesign of the coinage was unveiled the new designs were issued gradually into circulation starting in mid-2008 the new reverses of the 1p 2p 5p 10p 20p and 50p coins feature parts of the royal shield and the new pound coin depicts the whole shield the coins have the same sizes shapes and weights as those with the old designs which will continue to circulate banknotesedit the first sterling notes were issued by the bank of england shortly after its foundation in 1694 denominations were initially written on the notes at the time of issue from 1745 the notes were printed in denominations between £20 and £1000 with any odd shillings added by hand £10 notes were added in 1759 followed by £5 in 1793 and £1 and £2 in 1797 the lowest two denominations were withdrawn following the end of the napoleonic wars in 1855 the notes were converted to being entirely printed with denominations of £5 £10 £20 £50 £100 £200 £300 £500 and £1000 issued the bank of scotland began issuing notes in 1695 although the pound scots was still the currency of scotland these notes were denominated in sterling in values up to £100 from 1727 the royal bank of scotland also issued notes both banks issued some notes denominated in guineas as well as pounds in the 19th century regulations limited the smallest note issued by scottish banks to be the £1 denomination a note not permitted in england with the extension of sterling to ireland in 1825 the bank of ireland began issuing sterling notes later followed by other irish banks these notes included the unusual denominations of 30- and £3 the highest denomination issued by the irish banks was £100 in 1826 banks at least 65 miles  105km from london were given permission to issue their own paper money from 1844 new banks were excluded from issuing notes in england and wales but not in scotland and ireland consequently the number of private banknotes dwindled in england and wales but proliferated in scotland and ireland the last english private banknotes were issued in 1921 in 1914 the treasury introduced notes for 10- and £1 to replace gold coins these circulated until 1928 when they were replaced by bank of england notes irish independence reduced the number of irish banks issuing sterling notes to five operating in northern ireland the second world war had a drastic effect on the note production of the bank of england fearful of mass forgery by the nazis see operation bernhard all notes for £10 and above ceased production leaving the bank to issue only 10- £1 and £5 notes scottish and northern irish issues were unaffected with issues in denominations of £1 £5 £10 £20 £50 and £100 the bank of england reintroduced £10 notes in 1964 in 1969 the 10- note was replaced by the 50p coin as part of the preparation for decimalisation £20 bank of england notes were reintroduced in 1970 followed by £50 in 1981 73 following the introduction of the £1 coin in 1983 bank of england £1 notes were withdrawn in 1988 scottish and northern irish banks followed with only the royal bank of scotland continuing to issue this denomination uk notes include raised print eg on the words bank of england watermarks embedded metallic thread holograms and fluorescent ink visible only under uv lamps three printing techniques are involved offset litho intaglio and letterpress and incorporate a total of 85 specialized inks 74 the £5 polymer banknote issued by northern bank now danske bank in 2000 was the only polymer note in circulation until 2016 although danske bank also produces paper-based £10 £20 and £50 notes the bank of england introduced £5 polymer banknotes in september 2016 the bank of england produces notes named giant and titan 75 a giant is a one million pound note and a titan is a one hundred million pound bank note 76 of which there are about 40 giants and titans are used only within the banking system monetary policyedit as the central bank of the united kingdom which has been delegated authority by the government the bank of england sets the monetary policy for the british pound by controlling the amount of money in circulation it has a monopoly on issuance of banknotes in england and wales and regulates the amount of banknotes issued by seven authorized banks in scotland and northern ireland 77 hm treasury has reserve powers to give orders to the committee if they are required in the public interest and by extreme economic circumstances but such orders must be endorsed by parliament within 28 days 78 unlike banknotes which have separate issuers in scotland and northern ireland all uk coins are issued by the royal mint which is an independent enterprise wholly owned by the treasury which also mints coins for other countries in britains crown dependencies the manx pound jersey pound and guernsey pound are unregulated by the bank of england and are issued independently 79 however they are maintained at a fixed exchange rate by their respective governments and bank of england notes have been made legal tender on the islands forming a sort of one-way de facto currency union these currencies do not have iso 4217 codes so gbp is usually used to represent all of them informal codes are used where the difference is important british overseas territories are responsible for the monetary policy of their own currencies where they exist 80 and have their own iso 4217 codes the falkland islands pound gibraltar pound and saint helena pound are set at a fixed 1:1 exchange rate with the british pound by local governments legal tender and national issuesedit legal tender in the united kingdom is defined such that a debtor cannot successfully be sued for non-payment if he pays into court in legal tender parties can alternatively settle a debt by other means with mutual consent strictly speaking it is necessary for the debtor to offer the exact amount due as there is no obligation for the other party to provide change 81 throughout the uk £1 and £2 coins are legal tender for any amount with the other coins being legal tender only for limited amounts bank of england notes are legal tender for any amount in england and wales but not in scotland or northern ireland 82 bank of england 10- and £1 notes were legal tender as were scottish banknotes during world war ii under the currency defence act 1939 repealed on 1 january 1946 channel islands and isle of man banknotes are legal tender only in their respective jurisdictions bank of england scottish northern irish channel islands isle of man gibraltar and falkland banknotes may be offered anywhere in the uk although there is no obligation to accept them as a means of payment and acceptance varies for example merchants in england generally accept scottish and northern irish bills but some unfamiliar with them may reject them 83 merchants in england generally do not accept jersey guernsey isle of man gibraltar and falkland notes but isle of man notes are generally accepted in scotland and northern ireland bank of england notes are generally accepted in the falklands and gibraltar but for example scottish and northern irish notes are not 84 since all of the bills are denominated in pounds sterling banks will exchange them for locally issued bills at face value though some in the uk have had trouble exchanging falkland islands pounds 85 commemorative £5 and 25p crown coins rarely seen in circulation are legal tender as are the bullion coins issued by the mint valueedit in 2006 the house of commons library published a research paper which included an index of prices in pounds for each year between 1750 and 2005 where 1974 was indexed at 100 88 regarding the period 1750–1914 the document states although there was considerable year on year fluctuation in price levels prior to 1914 reflecting the quality of the harvest wars etc there was not the long-term steady increase in prices associated with the period since 1945 it goes on to say that since 1945 prices have risen in every year with an aggregate rise of over 27 times the value of the index in 1751 was 5.1 increasing to a peak of 16.3 in 1813 before declining very soon after the end of the napoleonic wars to around 10.0 and remaining in the range 8.5–10.0 at the end of the nineteenth century the index was 9.8 in 1914 and peaked at 25.3 in 1920 before declining to 15.8 in 1933 and 1934prices were only about three times as high as they had been 180 years earlier 89 inflation had a dramatic effect during and after world war iithe index was 20.2 in 1940 33.0 in 1950 49.1 in 1960 73.1 in 1970 263.7 in 1980 497.5 in 1990 671.8 in 2000 and 757.3 in 2005 the following table shows the equivalent amount of goods and services that in a particular year could be purchased with £1 90 91 the table shows that from 1971 through 2015 the british pound has lost about 92 of its buying power the smallest coin in 1971 was the  1⁄2p worth about
