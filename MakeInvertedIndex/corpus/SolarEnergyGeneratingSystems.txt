solar energy generating systems solar energy generating systems segs in california with the combined capacity from three separate locations at 354 megawatts mw 474,700hp is now the worlds second largest solar thermal energy generating facility after the commissioning of the even larger ivanpah facility in 2014 it consists of nine solar power plants in californias mojave desert where

nextera energy resources operates and partially owns the plants located at kramer junction and harper lake a tenth plant segs x 80mw had been in construction and segs xi and segs xii had been planned by luz industries but the developer filed for bankruptcy in 1992 because it was unable to secure construction financing 2  contents 1 plants scale and operations 2 principle of operation 2.1 mirrors

output coming only from the solar source is around 75 mwe  representing a 21 capacity factor in addition the turbines can be utilized at night by burning natural gas nextera claims that the solar plants power 232,500 homеs during the day at peak power and displace 3,800tons of pollution pеr year that would have been produced if the electricity had bееn providеd by fossil fuels such as oil 3 the facilities have a total of 936,384 mirrors and cover more than 1,600 acres  647.5ha lined up the parabolic mirrors would extend over 229 miles  369km as an example of cost in 2002 one of the 30 mw kramer junction sites required $90 million to construct and its operation and maintenance cost was about $3 million per year  4.6 cents per kilowatt hour 4 with a considered lifetime of 20 years the operation maintenance and investments interest and depreciation triples the price to approximately 14 cents per kilowatt hourcitation needed principle of operationedit the installation uses parabolic trough solar thermal technology along with natural gas to generate electricity about 90 of the electricity is produced by the sunlightcitation needed natural gas is only used when the solar power is insufficient to meet the demand from southern california edison the distributor of power in southern california mirrorsedit the parabolic mirrors are shaped like quarter-pipes the sun shines onto the panels made of glass which are 94reflective unlike a typical mirror which is only 70reflective the mirrors automatically track the sun throughout the day the greatest source of mirror breakage is wind with 3,000 mirrors typically replaced each year operators can turn the mirrors to protect them during intense wind storms an automated washing mechanism is used to periodically clean the parabolic reflective panels heat transferedit the sunlight bounces off the mirrors and is directed to a central tube filled with synthetic oil which heats to over 400c  750f the reflected light focused at the central tube is 71 to 80times more intense than the ordinary sunlight the synthetic oil transfers its heat to water which boils and drives the rankine cycle steam turbine 5 thereby generating electricity synthetic oil is used to carry the heat instead of water to keep the pressure within manageable parameters individual locationsedit the segs power plants were built by luz industries 5 6 and commissioned between december 20 1984 and october 1 1990 7 after luz industries bankruptcy in 1991 plants were sold to various investor groups as individual projects and expansion including three more plants was halted 2 kramer junction employs about 95people and 45people work at harper lake harper lakeedit segs viii and segs ix located at 35°01′55n 117°20′50w  ﻿35.031815n 117.347270w
