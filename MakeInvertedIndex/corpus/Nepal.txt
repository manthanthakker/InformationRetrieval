sports  etymology local legends have that a hindu sage named ne established himself in the valley of kathmandu in prehistoric times and that the word nepal came into existence as the place was protected pala in pali by the sage nemi it is mentioned in vedic texts that this region was called nepal centuries ago according to the skanda purana a rishi called nemi used to live in the himalayas 20 in the pashupati purana he is mentioned as a saint and a protector 21 he is said to have practised meditation at the bagmati and kesavati rivers 22 and to have taught there 23 the name of the country is also identical in origin to the name of the newar people the terms nepāl newār newāl and nepār are phonetically different forms of the same word and instances of the various forms appear in texts in different times in history nepal is the learned sanskrit form and newar is the colloquial prakrit form 24 a sanskrit inscription dated 512 ce found in tistung a valley to the west of kathmandu contains the phrase greetings to the nepals indicating that the term nepal was used to refer to both the country and the people 25 26 it has been suggested that nepal may be a sanskritization of newar or newar may be a later form of nepal 27 according to another explanation the words newar and newari are vulgarisms arising from the mutation of p to v and l to r 28 nepal is likely singular for nephilim npl נפל which is ancient semitic for protector sanskrit is formed from the phœnician alphabet ie canaanite aleph-bet history ancient neolithic tools found in the kathmandu valley indicate that people have been living in the himalayan region for at least eleven thousand years 29 the oldest population layer is believed to be represented by the kusunda people 30 nepal is first mentioned in the late vedic atharvaveda pariśiṣṭa as a place exporting blankets and in the post-vedic atharvashirsha upanishad 31 in samudraguptas allahabad pillar it is mentioned as a bordering country the skanda purana has a separate chapter known as nepal mahatmya that explains in more details about the beauty and power of nepal 32 nepal is also mentioned in hindu texts such as the narayana puja 31 tibeto-burman-speaking people probably lived in nepal 2500 years ago 33 however there is no archaeologic evidence of the gopal bansa or kirati rulers only mention by the later licchavi and malla eras 34 around 500 bce small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of nepal from one of these the shakya polity arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life founded buddhism and came to be known as gautama buddha traditionally dated 563–483 bce by 250 bce the southern regions came under the influence of the maurya empire of north india and parts of nepal later on became a nominal vassal state under the gupta empire in the fourth century ce beginning in the third century ce the licchavi kingdom governed the kathmandu valley and the region surrounding central nepal there is a quite detailed description of the kingdom of nepal in the account of the renowned chinese buddhist pilgrim monk xuanzang dating from c 645 ce 35 36 stone inscriptions in the kathmandu valley are important sources for the history of nepal the licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late eighth century probably due to the tibetan empire and was followed by a newar or thakuri era from 879 ce nepal sambat 1 although the extent of their control over the present-day country is uncertain 37 in the eleventh century it seems to have included the pokhara area by the late eleventh century southern nepal came under the influence of the chalukya dynasty of south india under the chalukyas nepals religious establishment changed as the kings patronised hinduism instead of the buddhism prevailing at that time medieval in the early 12th century leaders emerged in far western nepal whose names ended with the sanskrit suffix malla wrestler these kings consolidated their power and ruled over the next 200 years until the kingdom splintered into two dozen petty states another malla dynasty beginning with jayasthiti emerged in the kathmandu valley in the late 14th century and much of central nepal again came under a unified rule in 1482 the realm was divided into three kingdoms kathmandu patan and bhaktapur kingdom of nepal  1768–2008 in the mid-18th century prithvi narayan shah a gorkha king set out to put together what would become present-day nepal he embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms after several bloody battles and sieges notably the battle of kirtipur he managed to conquer the kathmandu valley in 1769 a detailed account of prithvi narayan shahs victory was written by father giuseppe an eyewitness to the war 38 the gorkha dominion reached its height when the north indian territories of the kumaon and garhwal kingdoms in the west to sikkim in the east came under nepal rule at its maximum extent greater nepal extended from the teesta river in the east to kangra himachal pradesh across the sutlej in the west as well as further south into the terai plains and north of the himalayas than at present a dispute with tibet over the control of mountain passes and inner tingri valleys of tibet forced the qing emperor of china to start the sino-nepali war compelling the nepali to retreat and pay heavy reparations to peking rivalry between kingdom of nepal and the east india company over the annexation of minor states bordering nepal eventually led to the anglo-nepali war  1815–16 at first the british underestimated the nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing they were greatly impressed by the valour and competence of their adversaries thus began the reputation of gurkhas as fierce and ruthless soldiers the war ended in the sugauli treaty under which nepal ceded recently captured portions of sikkim and lands in terai as well as the right to recruit soldiers madhesis having supported the east india company during the war had their lands gifted to nepali 39 factionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability in 1846 a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow jung bahadur kunwar a fast-rising military leader this led to the kot massacre armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country jung bahadur kunwar emerged victorious and founded the rana dynasty later known as jung bahadur rana the king was made a titular figure and the post of prime minister was made powerful and hereditary the ranas were staunchly pro-british and assisted them during the indian rebellion of 1857 and later in both world wars some parts of the terai region populated with non-nepali peoples were gifted to nepal by the british as a friendly gesture because of her military help to sustain british control in india during the rebellion in 1923 the united kingdom and nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship that superseded the sugauli treaty of 1816 39 slavery was abolished in nepal in 1924 40 nevertheless debt bondage even involving debtors children has been a persistent social problem in the terai rana rule was marked by tyranny debauchery economic exploitation and religious persecution 41 42 in the late 1940s newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in nepal were critical of the rana autocracy meanwhile with the invasion of tibet by china in the 1950s india sought to counterbalance the perceived military threat from its northern neighbour by taking pre-emptive steps to assert more influence in nepal india sponsored both king tribhuvan ruled 1911–55 as nepals new ruler in 1951 and a new government mostly comprising the nepali congress thus terminating rana hegemony in the kingdom 39 after years of power wrangling between the king and the government king mahendra ruled 1955–72 scrapped the democratic experiment in 1959 and a partyless panchayat system was made to govern nepal until 1989 when the jan andolan peoples movement forced king birendra ruled 1972–2001 to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament that took seat in may 1991 43 in 1991–92 bhutan expelled roughly 100,000 bhutanese citizens of nepali descent most of whom have been living in seven refugee camps in eastern nepal ever since 44 in 1996 the communist party of nepal started a bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a peoples republic by violent means this led to the long nepali civil war and more than 12,000 deaths on 1 june 2001 there was a massacre in the royal palace king birendra queen aishwarya and seven other members of the royal family were killed the perpetrator was crown prince dipendra who committed suicide he died three days later shortly thereafter this outburst was alleged to have been dipendras response to his parents refusal to accept his choice of wife nevertheless there is speculation and doubts among nepali citizens about who was responsible following the carnage king birendras brother gyanendra inherited the throne on 1 february 2005 king gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers to quash the violent maoist movement 43 but this initiative was unsuccessful because a stalemate had developed in which the maoists were firmly entrenched in large expanses of countryside but could not yet dislodge the military from numerous towns and the largest cities in september 2005 the maoists declared a three-month unilateral ceasefire to negotiate in response to the 2006 democracy movement king gyanendra agreed to relinquish sovereign power to the people on 24 april 2006 the dissolved house of representatives was reinstated using its newly acquired sovereign authority on 18 may 2006 the house of representatives unanimously voted to curtail the power of the king and declared nepal a secular state ending its time-honoured official status as a hindu kingdom on 28 december 2007 a bill was passed in parliament to amend article 159 of the constitution replacing provisions regarding the king by provisions of the head of the state declaring nepal a federal republic and thereby abolishing the monarchy 45 the bill came into force on 28 may 2008 46 republic  2008 the unified communist party of nepal maoist won the largest number of seats in the constituent assembly election held on 10 april 2008 and formed a coalition government which included most of the parties in the ca although acts of violence occurred during the pre-electoral period election observers noted that the elections themselves were markedly peaceful and well-carried out 47 the newly elected assembly met in kathmandu on 28 may 2008 and after a polling of 564 constituent assembly members 560 voted to form a new government 46 with the monarchist rastriya prajatantra party which had four members in the assembly registering a dissenting note at that point it was declared that nepal had become a secular and inclusive democratic republic 48 49 with the government announcing a three-day public holiday from 28–30 may the king was thereafter given 15 days to vacate narayanhity palace so it could reopen as a public museum 50 nonetheless political tensions and consequent power-sharing battles have continued in nepal in may 2009 the maoist-led government was toppled and another coalition government with all major political parties barring the maoists was formed 51 madhav kumar nepal of the communist party of nepal unified marxistleninist was made the prime minister of the coalition government 52 in february 2011 the madhav kumar nepal government was toppled and jhala nath khanal of the communist party of nepal unified marxistleninist was made the prime minister 53 in august 2011 the jhala nath khanal government was toppled and baburam bhattarai of the communist party of nepal maoist was made the prime minister 54 the political parties were unable to draft a constitution in the stipulated time 55 this led to dissolution of the constituent assembly to pave way for new elections to strive for a new political mandate in opposition to the theory of separation of powers then chief justice khil raj regmi was made the chairman of the caretaker government under regmi the nation saw peaceful elections for the constituent assembly the major forces in the earlier constituent assembly namely cpn maoists and madhesi parties dropped to distant 3rd and even below 56 57 in february 2014 after consensus was reached between the two major parties in the constituent assembly sushil koirala was sworn in as the new prime minister of nepal 58 59 in 20 september 2015 a new constitution the constitution of nepal 2015 nepali नपलक सवधन २०७२ was announced by president ram baran yadav in the constituent assembly the constituent assembly was transformed into a legislative parliament by the then-chairman of that assembly the new constitution of nepal has changed nepal practically into a federal democratic republic by making 7 unnamed states on 25 april 2015 a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck nepal 60 two weeks later on 12 may another earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 hit nepal which left more than 8,500 people dead and about 21,000 injured 61 in october 2015 bidhya devi bhandari was nominated as the first female president 62 geography nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape 800 kilometres  497mi long and 200 kilometres  124mi wide with an area of 147,181km2  56,827sqmi see list of territories by size for the comparative size of nepal it lies between latitudes 26 and 31n and longitudes 80 and 89e nepal is commonly divided into three physiographic areas mountain hill and terai these ecological belts run east-west and are vertically intersected by nepals major north to south flowing river systems the southern lowland plains or terai bordering india are part of the northern rim of the indo-gangetic plain they were formed and are fed by three major himalayan rivers the kosi the narayani and the karnali as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline this region has a subtropical to tropical climate the outermost range of foothills called sivalik hills or churia range cresting at 700 to 1,000 metres  2,297 to 3,281ft marks the limit of the gangetic plain however broad low valleys called inner tarai valleys bhitri tarai uptyaka lie north of these foothills in several places the hill region pahad abuts the mountains and varies from 800 to 4,000 metres  2,625 to 13,123ft in altitude with progression from subtropical climates below 1,200 metres  3,937ft to alpine climates above 3,600 metres  11,811ft the lower himalayan range reaching 1,500 to 3,000 metres  4,921 to 9,843ft is the southern limit of this region with subtropical river valleys and hills alternating to the north of this range population density is high in valleys but notably less above 2,000 metres  6,562ft and very low above 2,500 metres  8,202ft where snow occasionally falls in winter the mountain region himal situated in the great himalayan range makes up the northern part of nepal it contains the highest elevations in the world

4,400 metres  14,436ft nepal experiences five seasons summer monsoon autumn winter and spring the himalaya blocks cold winds from central asia in the winter and forms the northern limit of the monsoon wind patterns in a land once thickly forested deforestation is a major problem in all regions with resulting erosion and degradation of ecosystems nepal is popular for mountaineering having some of the highest and most challenging mountains in the world including mount everest technically the south-east ridge on the nepali side of the mountain is easier to climb so most climbers prefer to trek to everest through nepal the highest mountains in nepal are given here 63 geology the collision between the indian subcontinent and eurasia which started in paleogene time and continues today produced the himalaya and the tibetan plateau nepal lies completely within this collision zone occupying the central sector of the himalayan arc nearly one third of the 2,400km  1,500mi-long himalayas 64 65 66 67 68 69 the indian plate continues to move north relative to asia at the rate of approximately 50mm  2.0in per year 70 this is approximately twice the speed at which human fingernails grow which is very fast given the size of the blocks of earths crust involvedoriginal research as the strong indian continental crust subducts beneath the relatively weak tibetan crust it pushes up the himalayan mountains this collision zone has accommodated huge amounts of crustal shortening as the rock sequences slide one over another based on a study published in 2014 of the main frontal thrust on average a great earthquake occurs every 750 140 and 870 350years in the east nepal region 71 a study from 2015 found a 700-year delay between earthquakes in the region the study also suggests that because of tectonic stress transfer the earthquake from 1934 in nepal and the 2015 earthquake are connected - following a historic earthquake pattern 72 erosion of the himalayas is a very important source of sediment which flows via several great rivers the indus ganges and brahmaputra river systems to the indian ocean 73 environment the dramatic differences in elevation found in nepal result in a variety of biomes from tropical savannas along the indian border to subtropical broadleaf and coniferous forests in the hill region to temperate broadleaf and coniferous forests on the slopes of the himalaya to montane grasslands and shrublands and rock and ice at the highest elevations at the lowest elevations is the terai-duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion these form a mosaic with the himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests which occur from 500 to 1,000 metres  1,600 to 3,300ft and include the inner terai valleys himalayan subtropical pine forests occur between 1,000 and 2,000 metres  3,300 and 6,600ft above these elevations the biogeography of nepal is generally divided from east to west by the gandaki river ecoregions to the east tend to receive more precipitation and to be more species-rich those to the west are drier with fewer species from 1,500 to 3,000 metres  4,900 to 9,800ft are temperate broadleaf forests the eastern and western himalayan broadleaf forests from 3,000 to 4,000 metres  9,800 to 13,100ft are the eastern and western himalayan subalpine conifer forests to 5,500 metres  18,000ft are the eastern and western himalayan alpine shrub and meadows landscapes

until 1990 nepal was a monarchy under executive control of the king faced with a communist movement against absolute monarchy king birendra in 1990 agreed to a large-scale political reform by creating a parliamentary monarchy with the king as the head of state and a prime minister as the head of the government nepals legislature was bicameral consisting of a house of representatives called the pratinidhi sabha and a national council called the rastriya sabha the house of representatives consisted of 205 members directly elected by the people the national council had 60 members ten nominated by the king 35 elected by the house of representatives and the remaining 15 elected by an electoral college made up of chairs of villages and towns the legislature had a five-year term but was dissolvable by the king before its term could end all nepali citizens 18 years and older became eligible to vote the executive comprised the king and the council of ministers the cabinet the leader of the coalition or party securing the maximum seats in an election was appointed as the prime minister the cabinet was appointed by the king on the recommendation of the prime minister governments in nepal tended to be highly unstable falling either through internal collapse or parliamentary dissolution by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister according to the constitution no government has survived for more than two years since 1991 the movement in april 2006 brought about a change in the nations governance an interim constitution was promulgated with the king giving up power and an interim house of representatives was formed with maoist members after the new government held peace talks with the maoist rebels the number of parliamentary seats was also increased to 330 in april 2007 the communist party of nepal maoist joined the interim government of nepal in december 2007 the interim parliament passed a bill making nepal a federal republic with a president as head of state elections for the constitutional assembly were held on 10 april 2008 the maoist party led the results but did not achieve a simple majority of seats 74 the new parliament adopted the 2007 bill at its first meeting by an overwhelming majority and king gyanendra was given 15 days to leave the royal palace in central kathmandu he left on 11 june 75 on 26 june 2008 the prime minister girija prasad koirala who had served as acting head of state since january 2007 announced that he would resign on the election of the countrys first president by the constituent assembly the first

republic on 4 may 2009 dahal resigned over on-going conflicts with regard to the sacking of the army chief since dahals resignation the country has been in a serious political deadlock with one of the big issues being the proposed integration of the former maoist combatants also known as the peoples liberation army into the national security forces 77 after dahal jhala nath khanal of cpn uml was elected the prime minister khanal was forced to step down as he could not succeed in carrying forward the peace process and the constitution writing on august 2011 maoist babu ram bhattarai became

people and elect a new assembly to write the constitution he said in a nationally televised speech one of the main obstacles has been disagreement over whether the states which will be created will be based on ethnicity 80 nepal is one of the few countries in asia to abolish the death penalty 81 nepal is the only asian country where the possibility of same-sex marriage has been proposed in the high court and in the legislature although same-sex marriage currently does not exist in nepal see also lgbt rights in nepal and same-sex marriage in nepal the decision was based on a seven-person

travel to each others countries without a passport or visa nepali citizens may work in india without legal restriction the indian army maintains seven gorkha regiments consisting of gorkha troops recruited mostly from nepal however in the years since the government of nepal has been dominated by socialists and indias government has been controlled by more right-wing parties india has been remilitarizing the porous indo-nepali border to stifle the flow of islamist groups 85 nepal established relations with the peoples republic of china on 1 august 1955 and relations since have been based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence nepal has aided china in the aftermath of the 2008 sichuan earthquake and china has provided economic assistance for nepali infrastructure both countries have cooperated to host the 2008 summer olympics summit of mt everest 86 nepal has assisted in curbing anti-china protests from the tibetan diaspora 87 military nepals military consists of the nepali army which includes the nepali army air service the nepali police force is the civilian police and the armed police force nepal 88 is the paramilitary force service is voluntary and the minimum age for enlistment is 18 years nepal spends $99.2 million  2004 on its military—1.5 of its gdp much of the equipment and arms are imported from india consequently the us provided m16s m4s and other colt weapons to combat communist maoist insurgents the standard-issue battle rifle of the nepali army is the colt m16 89 in the new regulations by nepali army female soldiers have been barred from participating in combat situations and fighting in the frontlines of war however they are allowed to be a part of the army in sections like intelligence headquarters signals and operations 90 subdivisions as of 20 september 2015 nepal is divided into 7 provinces and 75 districts province no 1 province no 2 province no 3 province no 4 province no 5 province no 6 province no 7 economy nepals gross domestic product gdp for 2012 was estimated at over $17.921 billion adjusted to nominal gdp 6 in 2010 agriculture accounted for 36.1 services comprised 48.5 and industry 15.4 of nepals gdp 92 while agriculture and industry are contracting the contribution by the service sector is increasing 92 93 agriculture employs 76 of the workforce services 18 and manufacturing and craft-based industry 6 agricultural produce mostly grown in the terai region bordering india includes tea rice corn wheat sugarcane root crops milk and water buffalo meat industry mainly involves the processing of agricultural produce including jute sugarcane tobacco and grain its workforce of about 10 million suffers from a severe shortage of skilled labor nepals economic growth continues to be adversely affected by the political uncertainty nevertheless real gdp growth was estimated to increase to almost 5 percent for 2011–2012 this is an improvement from the 3.5 percent gdp growth in 2010–2011 and would be the second-highest growth rate in the post-conflict era 94 sources of growth include agriculture construction financial and other services the contribution of growth by consumption fueled by remittances has declined since 2010/2011 while remittance growth slowed to 11 percent in nepali rupee terms in 2010/2011 it has since increased to 37 percent remittances are estimated to be equivalent to 25–30 percent of gdp inflation has been reduced to a three-year low of 7 percent 94 the proportion of poor people has declined substantially since 2003 the percentage of people living below the international poverty line people earning less than us$1.25 per day has halved in seven years 94 at this measure of poverty the percentage of poor people declined from 53.1 in 2003/2004 to 24.8 in 2010/2011 94 with a higher poverty line of us$2 per-capita per day poverty declined by one-quarter to 57.3 94 however the income distribution remains grossly uneven 95 in a recent survey nepal has performed extremely well in reducing poverty along with rwanda and bangladesh as the percentage of poor dropped to 44.2 percent of the population in 2011 from 64.7 percent in 2006—4.1 percentage points per year which means that nepal has made improvement in sectors like nutrition child mortality electricity improved flooring and assets if the progress of reducing poverty continues at this rate then it is predicted that nepal will halve the current poverty rate and eradicate it within the next 20 years 96 97 98 the spectacular landscape and diverse exotic cultures of nepal represent considerable potential for tourism but growth in the industry has been stifled by political instability and poor infrastructure despite these problems in 2012 the number of international tourists visiting nepal was 598,204 a 10 increase on the previous year 99 the tourism sector contributed nearly 3 of national gdp in 2012 and is the second-biggest foreign income earner after remittances 100 the rate of unemployment and underemployment approaches half of the working-age population thus many nepali citizens move to other countries in search of work destinations include india qatar the united states thailand the united kingdom saudi arabia japan brunei darussalam australia and canada 101 102 nepal receives $50 million a year through the gurkha soldiers who serve in the indian and british armies and are highly esteemed for their skill and bravery as of 2010update the total remittance value is around $3.5 billion 102 in 2009 alone the remittance contributed to 22.9 of the nations gdp 102 a long-standing economic agreement underpins a close relationship with india the country receives foreign aid from the uk 103 104 india japan the us the eu china switzerland and scandinavian countries poverty is acute per-capita income is around $1,000 105 the distribution of wealth among the nepali is consistent with that in many developed and developing countries the highest 10 of households control 39.1 of the national wealth and the lowest 10 control only 2.6 the governments budget is about $1.153 billion with an expenditure of $1.789 billion fy 20005/06 the nepali rupee has been tied to the indian rupee at an exchange rate of 1.6 for many years since the loosening of exchange rate controls in the early 1990s the black market for foreign exchange has all but disappeared the inflation rate has dropped to 2.9 after a period of higher inflation during the 1990s nepals exports of mainly carpets clothing hemp leather goods jute goods and grain total $822 million import commodities of mainly gold machinery and equipment petroleum products and fertilizer total us$2 billion european union eu  46.13 the us  17.4 and germany  7.1 are its main export partners the european union has emerged the largest buyer of nepali ready-made garments rmg exports to the eu accounted for "46.13 percent of the countrys total garment exports 106 nepals import partners include india  47.5 the united arab emirates  11.2 china  10.7 saudi arabia  4.9 and singapore  4 besides having landlocked rugged geography few tangible natural resources and poor infrastructure the ineffective post-1950 government and the long-running civil war are also factors in stunting the nations economic growth and development 107 108 109 infrastructure energy the bulk of the energy in nepal comes from fuel wood  68 agricultural waste  15 animal dung  8 and imported fossil fuels  8 110 111 except for some lignite deposits nepal has no known oil gas or coal deposits all commercial fossil fuels mainly oil and coal are either imported from india or from international markets routed through india and china fuel imports absorb over one-fourth of nepals foreign exchange earnings 111 only about 1 energy need is fulfilled by electricity the perennial nature of nepali rivers and the steep gradient of the countrys topography provide ideal conditions for the development of some of the worlds largest hydroelectric projects current estimates put nepals economically feasible hydropower potential to be approximately 83,000 mw from 66 hydropower project sites 111 112 however currently nepal has been able to exploit only about 600 mw from 20 medium to large hydropower plants and a number of small and micro hydropower plants 110 there are 9 major hydropower plants under construction and additional 27 sites considered for potential development 110 only about 40 of nepals population has access to electricity 110 there is a great disparity between urban and rural areas the electrification rate in urban areas is 90 whereas the rate for rural areas is only 5 111 power cuts of up to 22 hours a day take place in peak demand periods of winter and the peak electricity demand is almost the double the capability or dependable capacity 113 the position of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs high system losses high generation costs high overheads over staffing and lower domestic demand 111 transport nepal remains isolated from the worlds major land air and sea transport routes although within the country aviation is in a better state with 47 airports 11 of them with paved runways 114 flights are frequent and support a sizable traffic the hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive in 2007 there were just over 10,142km  6,302mi of paved roads and 7,140km  4,437mi of unpaved road and one 59km  37mi railway line in the south 114 there is a single reliable road route from india to the kathmandu valley more than one-third of its people live at least a two hours walk from the nearest all-season road 15 out of 75 district headquarters are not connected by road in addition around 60 of road network and most rural roads are not operable during the rainy season 115 the only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for kathmandu is kolkata in west bengal state of india internally the poor state of development of the road system makes access to markets schools and health clinics a challenge 107 telecommunications and mass media according to the nepal telecommunication authority mis may 2012 report 116 there are seven operators and the total voice telephony subscribers including fixed and mobile are 16,350,946 which gives a penetration rate of 61.42 the fixed telephone service account for 9.37 mobile for 64.63 and other services lm gmpcs for 3.76 of the total penetration rate similarly the numbers of subscribers to datainternet services are 4,667,536 which represents 17.53 penetration rate most of the data service is accounted by gprs users twelve months earlier the datainternet penetration was 10.05 thus this represents a growth rate of 74.77 116 not only has there been strong subscriber growth especially in the mobile sector but there was evidence of a clear vision in the sector including putting a reform process in place and planning for the building of necessary telecommunications infrastructure most importantly the ministry of information and communications moic and the telecom regulator the national telecommunications authority nta have both been very active in the performance of their respective roles 117 despite all the effort there remained a significant disparity between the high coverage levels in the cities and the coverage available in the underdeveloped rural regions progress on providing some minimum access had been good of a total of 3,914 village development committees across the country 306 were unserved by december 2009 117 in order to meet future demand it was estimated that nepal needed to invest around us$135 million annually in its telecom sector 117 in 2009 the telecommunication sector alone contributed to 1 of the nations gdp 118 as of 30 september 2012 nepal has 1,828,700 facebook users 119 as of 2007update the state operates two television stations as well as national and regional radio stations there are roughly 30 independent tv channels registered with only about half in regular operation nearly 400 fm radio stations are licensed with roughly 300 operational 114 according to the 2011 census the percentage of households possessing radio was 50.82 television 36.45 cable tv 19.33 computer 7.23 5 according to the press council nepal as of 2012update there are 2,038 registered newspapers in nepal among which 514 are in publication 120 in 2013 reporters without borders ranked nepal at 118th place in the world in terms of press freedom 121 122 education the overall literacy rate for population age 5 years and above increased from 54.1 in 2001 to 65.9 in 2011 the male literacy rate was 75.1 compared to the female literacy rate of 57.4 the highest literacy rate was reported in kathmandu district  86.3 and lowest in rautahat  41.7 5 while the net primary enrollment rate was 74 in 2005 123 in 2009 that enrollment rate was 90 124 however increasing access to secondary education grade 9–12 remains a major challenge as evidenced by the low net enrollment rate of 24 at this level more than half of primary students do not enter secondary schools and only one-half of them complete secondary schooling in addition fewer girls than boys join secondary schools and among those who do fewer complete the 10th grade 125 nepal has seven universities tribhuvan university kathmandu university pokhara university purbanchal university mahendra sanskrit university far-western university and agriculture and forestry university 126 some newly proposed universities are lumbini bouddha university and mid-western university some fine scholarship has emerged in the post-1990 era 127 health public health and health care services in nepal are provided by both the public and private sectors and fare poorly by international standardscitation needed according to 2011 census more than one-third  38.17 of the total households do not have a toilet 5 tap water is the main source of drinking water for 47.78 of households tube wellhand pump is the main source of drinking water for about 35 of households while spout uncovered wellkuwa and covered wellkuwa are the main source for 5.74 4.71 and 2.45 respectively 5 based on 2010 world health organization who data nepal ranked 139th in life expectancy in 2010 with the average nepali living to 65.8 years 128 129 diseases are more prevalent in nepal than in other south asian countries especially in rural areas leading diseases and illnesses include diarrhea gastrointestinal disorders goitres intestinal parasites leprosy visceral leishmaniasis and tuberculosis 130 about 4 out of 1,000 adults aged 15 to 49 had human immunodeficiency virus hiv and the hiv prevalence rate was 0.5 131 132 malnutrition also remains very high about 47 of children under five are stunted 15 percent wasted and 36 percent underweight although there has been a declining trend for these rates over the past five years they remain alarmingly high 133 in spite of these figures improvements in health care have been made most notably in maternal-child health in 2012 the under-five infant mortality was estimated to be 41 out of every 1000 children 134 135 overall nepals human development index hdi for health was 0.77 in 2011 ranking nepal 126 out of 194 countries up from 0.444 in 1980 136 137 community forestry the community forestry program in nepal is a participatory environmental governance that encompasses well-defined policies institutions and practices the program addresses the twin goals of forest conservation and poverty reduction as more than 70 percent of nepals population depends on agriculture for their livelihood community management of forests has been a critically important intervention through legislative developments and operational innovations over three decades the program has evolved from a protection-oriented conservation-focused agenda to a much more broad-based strategy for forest use enterprise development and livelihood improvement by april 2009 one-third of nepals population was participating in the program directly managing more than one-fourth of nepals forest area 138 139 the immediate livelihood benefits derived by rural households bolster strong collective action wherein local communities actively and sustainably manage forest resources community forests also became the source of diversified investment capital and raw material for new market-oriented livelihoods community forestry shows traits of political financial and ecological sustainability including an emergence of a strong legal and regulatory framework and robust civil society institutions and networks however a continuing challenge is to ensure equitable distribution of benefits to women and marginalized groups lessons for replication emphasize experiential learning establishment of a strong civil society network flexible regulation to encourage diverse institutional modalities and responsiveness of government and policymakers to a multistakeholder collaborative learning process 140 141 science and technology historical kingdoms that existed in the kathmandu valley are found to have made use of some clever technologies in numerous areas such as architecture agriculture civil engineering water management etc the gopals and abhirs who ruled the valley up until c 1000 bc used temporary materials for construction such as bamboo hay timber etc the kirat period  700 bc  110 ad employed the technology of brick firing as well as produced quality woolen shawls similarly stupas idols canals self-recharging ponds reservoirs etc constructed during the lichhavi era  110 ad  879 ad are intact to this day which manifests the ingenuity of traditional architecture moreover the malla period  1200 ad  1768 ad saw an impressive growth in architecture on par with its advanced contemporaries an archetypal example of malla architecture is nyatapola a five-storied 30-meter tall temple in bhaktapur that has strangely survived at least four major earthquakes including the april 2015 nepal earthquake 142 nepal was a late entrant into the modern world of science and technology nepals first institution of higher education tri-chandra college was established by chandra shumsher in 1918 the college introduced science at the intermediate level a year later marking the genesis of formal science education in the country 142 however the college was not accessible to the general public but only to a handful of members of the rana regime throughout the rana regime that lasted for well over a century nepal was effectively isolated from the rest of the world owing to this isolation nepal was relatively untouched by and unfamiliar of social transformations brought about by the british invasion in india and the industrial revolution in the west 143 however after the advent of democracy and abolition of rana regime in 1951 nepal broke free from the shackles of self-imposed isolation and opened up to the outside world this opening marked the initiation of st activities in the country 144 an underdeveloped country nepal is plagued with problems like poverty illiteracy unemployment etc consequently science and technology have invariably lagged behind in the priority list of the government on the other hand citing poor university education at home tens of thousands of nepali students leave the country every year with half of them never returning 145 146 these factors have been huge deterrents to the development of science and technology in nepal crime and law enforcement law enforcement in nepal is primarily the responsibility of the nepali police force which is the national police of nepal 147 it is independent of the nepali army in the days of its establishment nepal police personnel were mainly drawn from the armed forces of the nepali congress party which fought against the feudal rana autocracy in nepal the central investigation bureau cib and national investigation department of nepal nid are the investigation agencies of nepal they have offices in all 75 administrative districts including regional offices in five regions and zonal offices in 14 zones numbers vary from three to five members at each district level in rural districts and numbers can be higher in urban districts they have both domestic and international surveillance unit which mainly deals with cross border terrorists drug trafficking and money laundering 148 149 150 151 a 2010 survey estimated about 46,000 hard drug users in the country with 70 of the users to be within the age group of 15 to 29 152 the same survey also reported that 19 of the users had been introduced to hard drugs when they were less than 15 years old and 14.4 of drug users were attending school or college 152 only 12 of the 17 municipalities studied had any type of rehabilitation center 152 153 there has been a sharp increase in the seizure of drugs such as hashish heroin and opium in the past few years and there are indications that drug traffickers are trying to establish nepal as a transit point 154 human trafficking is a major problem in nepal 155 156 157 nepali victims are trafficked within nepal to india the middle east and other areas such as malaysia and forced to become prostitutes domestic servants beggars factory workers mine workers circus performers child soldiers and others sex trafficking is particularly rampant within nepal and to india with as many as 5,000 to 10,000 women and girls trafficked to india alone each year 158 159 160 with wider availability of information technology cyber crime is a growing trend the police handled 16 cases of cyber crime in fiscal year 2010/2011 47 cases in 2011/2012 and 78 in the current fiscal year 161clarification needed capital punishment was abolished in nepal in 1997 162 in 2008 the nepali government abolished the haliya system of forced labour freeing about 20,000 people 163 however the effectiveness of this has been questioned by the asian legal resource centre 164 demographics according to the 2011 census nepals population grew from 9 million people in 1950 to 26.5 million from 2001 to 2011 the average family size declined from 5.44 to 4.9 the census also noted some 1.9 million absentee people over a million more than in 2001 most are male laborers employed overseas predominantly in south asia and the middle east this correlated with the drop in sex ratio from 94.41 as compared to 99.80 for 2001 the annual population growth rate is 1.35 5 the citizens of nepal are known as nepali or nepalese the country is home to people of many different national origins as a result nepalese do not equate their nationality with ethnicity but with citizenship and allegiance although citizens make up the majority of nepalese non-citizen residents dual citizens and expatriates may also claim a nepalese identity nepal is multicultural and multiethnic country because it became a country by occupying several small kingdoms such as mustang videha mithila madhesh and limbuwan in the 18th century the oldest settlements in mithila and tharuhat are indigenous maithil and aboriginal tharu people northern nepal is historically inhabited by kirants mongoloid rai and limbu people the mountainous region is sparsely populated above 3,000m  9,800ft but in central and western nepal ethnic sherpa and lamapeople inhabit even higher semi-arid valleys north of the himalaya kathmandu valley in the middle hill region constitutes a small fraction of the nations area but is the most densely populated with almost 5 percent of the nations population the nepali are descendants of three major migrations from india tibet and north burma and the chinese province of yunnan via assam among the earliest inhabitants were the kirat of east mid-region newars of the kathmandu valley aboriginal tharus of tharuhat madhesis of madhesh and maithils of mithila region ancient and indigenous madhesis are descendents of nepalese origin tribes while indian origin madhesis are the descendents of nepalese migrants to madhesh from indian state of bihar and uttar pradesh the brahmin bahun and kshatriya chettri caste groups are descendents of migrants from indias present banaras kumaon garhwal and kashmir regions while other ethnic groups trace their origins to north burma and yunnan and tibet eg the gurung and magar in the west rai sunuwar and limbu in the east from yunnan and north burma via assam and sherpa and bhutia in the north from tibet despite the migration of a significant section of the population to the madhesh southern plains in recent years the majority of nepalese still live in the central highlands the northern mountains are sparsely populated kathmandu with a population of over 2.6 million metropolitan area 5 milliondubious  discuss is the largest city in the country and the cultural and economic heart according to the world refugee survey 2008 published by the us committee for refugees and immigrants nepal hosted a population of refugees and asylum seekers in 2007 numbering approximately 130,000 of this population approximately 109,200 persons were from bhutan and 20,500 from peoples republic of china 165 166 the government of nepal restricted bhutanese refugees to seven camps in the jhapa and morang districts and refugees were not permitted to work in most professions 165 at present the united states is working towards resettling more than 60,000 of these refugees in the us 44 languages nepals diverse linguistic heritage stems from three major language groups indo-aryan tibeto-burman and various indigenous language isolates the major languages of nepal percent spoken as native language according to the 2011 census are nepali  44.6 maithili  11.7 bhojpuri awadhi language  6.0 tharu  5.8 tamang  5.1 nepal bhasa  3.2 bajjika  3 and magar  3.0 doteli  3.0 urdu

business speak maithili as the main language and nepali as their de facto lingua franca varieties of tibetan are spoken in and north of the higher himalaya where standard literary tibetan is widely understood by those with religious education local dialects in the terai and hills are mostly unwritten with efforts underway to develop systems for writing many in devanagari or the roman alphabet religion the overwhelming majority of the nepalese population follows hinduism shiva is regarded as the guardian deity of the country 168 nepal is home to the famous lord shiva temple the pashupatinath temple where hindus from all over the world come for pilgrimage according to hindu mythology the goddess sita of the epic ramayana was born in the mithila kingdom of king janaka raja lumbini is a buddhist pilgrimage site and unesco world heritage site in the kapilavastu district traditionally it is held to be the birthplace in about 563 bc of siddhartha gautama a kshatriya caste prince of the sakya clan who as the buddha gautama founded buddhism the holy site of lumbini is bordered by a large monastic zone in which only monasteries can be built all three main branches of buddhism exist in nepal and the newa people have their own branch of the faith 169 buddhism is also the dominant religion of the thinly populated northern areas which are mostly inhabited by tibetan-related peoples such as the sherpa the buddha born as a hindu is also said to be a descendant of vedic sage angirasa in many buddhist texts 170 the buddhas family surname is associated with gautama maharishi 171 differences between hindus and buddhists have been minimal in nepal due to the cultural and historical intermingling of hindu and buddhist beliefs moreover traditionally buddhism and hinduism were never two distinct religions in the western sense of the word in nepal the faiths share common temples and worship common deities among other natives of nepal those more influenced by hinduism were the magar sunwar limbu and rai and the gurkhas 33 hindu influence is less prominent among the gurung bhutia and thakali groups who employ buddhist monks for their religious ceremonies 33 most of the festivals in nepal are hindu 172 the machendrajatra festival dedicated to hindu shaiva siddha is celebrated by many buddhists in nepal as a main festival 173 as it is believed that ne muni established nepal 174 some important priests in nepal are called tirthaguru nemuni islam is a minority religion in nepal with 4.2 of the population being muslim according to a 2006 nepali census
