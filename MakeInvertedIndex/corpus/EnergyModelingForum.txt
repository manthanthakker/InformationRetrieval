energy modeling forum the energy modeling forum emf is a structured forum for discussing important issues in energy and the environment the emf was established in 1976 at stanford university the emf works through a series of ad hoc working groups each focussing on a particular corporate or policy decision the emf provides a non-partisan platform that ensures objective consideration of opposing views participation is by invitation since the late-1990s the emf has made contributions to the economics of climate change as witnessed in the reports of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and on integrated assessment modeling more generally john weyant is the current director of the emf  contents 1 ethos 2 list of emf projects 3 see also 4 references 5 external links  ethosedit the emf was convened in 1976 over concerns that the insights that large-scale energy models could provide policymakers were being overshadowed by the plethora of detailed quantitative results being disseminated and discussed 1:449 as a result the emf sought to bring energy modelers together to provide a proper context for their work indeed the emf was formed to foster better communication between the builders and users of energy models in energy planning and policy analysis 1:449 the emf periodically establishes ad hoc working groups to conduct studies on selected energy topics a working group then identifies relevant existing models and sets a series of tests to illuminate the basic structure and behavior of each model results are compared and the strengths and weaknesses of each model is documented in a as of 1982 freely available report 1 list of emf projectsedit reports for most of the completed projects are available from the emf website 2 reports since 2006 have sometimes been published exclusively in special editions of paywalled academic journals instead see alsoedit energy modeling  the process of building computer models of energy systems open energy modelling initiative  an open source energy modeling initiative centered on europe referencesedit external linksedit emf home page v t e aceges inems markal nems poles openei reegle climate change mitigation scenarios computer simulation energy modeling mathematical optimization scenario analysis system dynamics electricity market electric power transmission energy market energy planning energy policy integrated assessment modelling hartmut bossel mark jacobson john laitner john weyant energy modeling forum openmod initiative economics models energy models
