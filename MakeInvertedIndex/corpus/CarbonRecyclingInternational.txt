carbon recycling international carbon recycling international inc cri is an icelandic renewable methanol company its emissions-to-liquid process uses carbon dioxide and water and electricity to create methanol fuel 2 3  contents 1 history 2 renewable methanol 3 usage concerns 4 production 4.1 plants 5 legislation 6 impact 7 future projects 8 see also 9 references 10 external links 4.1 plants  historyedit cri incorporated in 2006 was founded by fridrik jonsson art shulenberger oddur ingolfsson and kc tran 4 partners include olís hs orka grindavík municipality mannvit engineering 5 and innovation center iceland 6 cris first commercial scale plant the george olah plant named after george andrew olah 7 the nobel prize laureate was completed in 2011 8 renewable methanoledit renewable methanol is methanol derived from renewable energy 9 it can be blended into transportation fuel or processed as a chemical feedstock rm is also a viable input for biodiesel production fuel blends range from rm3  3 methanol and 97 other to rm100  100 methanol with trace additives high percentage blends can be used with flexible-fuel vehicles ffvs while low percentage blends can be used in existing cars 10 cri is interested in increasing the number of flex-fuel cars in iceland and supplying rm85 11 usage concernsedit alcohols including methanol and ethanol can be corrosive to certain materials in some vehicles replacement parts may be necessary for higher blends but most modern cars are capable of using low blends of methanol productionedit production of renewable methanol is similar to that of conventional methanol except that carbon dioxide is substituted for carbon monoxide and hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water rm has no connection to agriculture as water electricity and carbon dioxide are the primary inputs of its production process production of rm is less vulnerable to changes in feedstock prices 12 plantsedit the george olah plant or the go plant has a capacity of 5 million liters per year 13 it is located close to the blue lagoon and svartsengi power station the plant is expected to use around 10 of the carbon dioxide produced by svartsengi power station 14 legislationedit the european unions renewable energy directives consider rm to be a renewable fuel making it a candidate for the eus renewable fuel blending mandates 15 impactedit carbon dioxide is a major component of global warming by removing carbon dioxide from industrial emissions cris process could help mitigate environmental impact renewable methanol burns cleanly as a fuel but it has trace amounts of impurities cris process can also be used to store energy in the form of methanol especially in cases where the energy source is inconsistent for example wind and solar power are irregularly available 16 17 methanol is also a good energy carrier being less volatile and easier to store than hydrogen future projectsedit cri plans to implement standardized csps commercial scale plants each with a capacity of 50 million liters per year 18 cri may build a 100 ml 19 plant in húsavík having signed a memorandum of understanding with power company landsvirkjun 20 cri has also entered into a memorandum of understanding with altona energy plc concerning a potential project using hydrogen byproduct as a feedstock 21 see alsoedit companies portal methanol economy referencesedit external linksedit methanol institute
