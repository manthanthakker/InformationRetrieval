volcano a volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object such as earth that allows hot lava volcanic ash and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface earths volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major rigid tectonic plates that float on a hotter softer layer in its mantle 1 therefore on earth volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging for example a mid-oceanic ridge such as the mid-atlantic ridge has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart the pacific ring of fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crusts interior platesclarify eg in the east african rift and the wells gray-clearwater volcanic field and rio grande rift in north america this type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of plate hypothesis volcanism 2 volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes these so-called hotspots for example hawaii are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the coremantle boundary 3,000km deep in the earth volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption one such hazard is that volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft in particular those with jet engines where ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature the melted particles then adhere to the turbine blades and alter their shape disrupting the operation of the turbine large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the earths lower atmosphere or troposphere however they also absorb heat radiated up from the earth thereby warming the upper atmosphere or stratosphere historically so-called volcanic winters have caused catastrophic famines  contents 1 etymology 2 plate tectonics 2.1

hazards  etymology the word volcano is derived from the name of vulcano a volcanic island in the aeolian islands of italy whose name in turn comes from vulcan the god of fire in roman mythology 3 the study of volcanoes is called volcanology sometimes spelled vulcanology plate tectonics divergent plate boundaries at the mid-oceanic ridges two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion and the partial melting of the mantle causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans therefore most volcanic activity is submarine forming new seafloor black smokers also known as deep sea vents are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level volcanic islands are formed for example iceland convergent plate boundaries subduction zones are places where two plates usually an oceanic plate and a continental plate collide in this case the oceanic plate subducts or submerges under the continental plate forming a deep ocean trench just offshore in a process called flux melting water released from the subducting plate lowers the melting temperature of the overlying mantle wedge creating magma this magma tends to be very viscous due to its high silica content so it often does not reach the surface but cools at depth when it does reach the surface a volcano is formed typical examples of this kind of volcano are mount etna and the volcanoes in the pacific ring of fire hotspots hotspots is the name given to volcanic areas believed to be formed by mantle plumes which are hypothesized to be columns of hot material rising from the core-mantle boundary in a fixed space that causes large-volume melting because tectonic plates move across them each volcano becomes dormant and is eventually reformed as the plate advances over the postulated plume the hawaiian islands have been suggested to have been formed in such a manner as well as the snake river plain with the yellowstone caldera being the part of the north american plate currently above the hot spot this theory is currently under criticism however 2 volcanic features the most common perception of a volcano is of a conical mountain spewing lava and poisonous gases from a crater at its summit however this describes just one of the many types of volcano the features of volcanoes are much more complicated and their structure and behavior depends on a number of factors some volcanoes have rugged peaks formed by lava domes rather than a summit crater while others have landscape features such as massive plateaus vents that issue volcanic material including lava and ash and gases mainly steam and magmatic gases can develop anywhere on the landform and may give rise to smaller cones such as puʻu ʻōʻō on a flank of hawaiis kīlauea other types of volcano include cryovolcanoes or ice volcanoes particularly on some moons of jupiter saturn and neptune and mud volcanoes which are formations often not associated with known magmatic activity active mud volcanoes tend to involve temperatures much lower than those of igneous volcanoes except when the mud volcano is actually a vent of an igneous volcano fissure vents volcanic fissure vents are flat linear fractures through which lava emerges shield volcanoes shield volcanoes so named for their broad shield-like profiles are formed by the eruption of low-viscosity lava that can flow a great distance from a vent they generally do not explode catastrophically since low-viscosity magma is typically low in silica shield volcanoes are more common in oceanic than continental settings the hawaiian volcanic chain is a series of shield cones and they are common in iceland as well lava domes lava domes are built by slow eruptions of highly viscous lava they are sometimes formed within the crater of a previous volcanic eruption as in the case of mount saint helens but can also form independently as in the case of lassen peak like stratovolcanoes they can produce violent explosive eruptions but their lava generally does not flow far from the originating vent cryptodomes cryptodomes are formed when viscous lava is forced upward causing the surface to bulge the 1980 eruption of mount st helens was an example lava beneath the surface of the mountain created an upward bulge which slid down the north side of the mountain volcanic cones cinder cones volcanic cones or cinder cones result from eruptions of mostly small pieces of scoria and pyroclastics both resemble cinders hence the name of this volcano type that build up around the vent these can be relatively short-lived eruptions that produce a cone-shaped hill perhaps 30 to 400 meters high most cinder cones erupt only once cinder cones may form as flank vents on larger volcanoes or occur on their own parícutin in mexico and sunset crater in arizona are examples of cinder cones in new mexico caja del rio is a volcanic field of over 60 cinder cones based on satellite images it was suggested that cinder cones might occur on other terrestrial bodies in the solar system too on the surface of mars and the moon 4 5 6 7 stratovolcanoes composite volcanoes stratovolcanoes or composite volcanoes are tall conical mountains composed of lava flows and other ejecta in alternate layers the strata that gives rise to the name stratovolcanoes are also known as composite volcanoes because they are created from multiple structures during different kinds of eruptions stratocomposite volcanoes are made of cinders ash and lava cinders and ash pile on top of each other lava flows on top of the ash where it cools and hardens and then the process repeats classic examples include mount fuji in japan mayon volcano in the philippines and mount vesuvius and stromboli in italy throughout recorded history ash produced by the explosive eruption of stratovolcanoes has posed the greatest volcanic hazard to civilizations not only do stratovolcanoes have greater pressure build up from the underlying lava flow than shield volcanoes but their fissure vents and monogenetic volcanic fields volcanic cones have more powerful eruptions as they are many times under extension they are also steeper than shield volcanoes with slopes of 30–35 compared to slopes of generally 5–10 and their loose tephra are material for dangerous lahars 8 large pieces of tephra are called volcanic bombs big bombs can measure more than 4 feet 1.2 meters across and weigh several tons 9 supervolcanoes a supervolcano usually has a large caldera and can produce devastation on an enormous sometimes continental scale such volcanoes are able to severely cool global temperatures for many years after the eruption due to the huge volumes of sulfur and ash released into the atmosphere they are the most dangerous type of volcano examples include yellowstone caldera in yellowstone national park and valles caldera in new mexico both western united states lake taupo in new zealand lake toba in sumatra indonesia and ngorongoro crater in tanzania because of the enormous area they may cover supervolcanoes are hard to identify centuries after an eruption similarly large igneous provinces are also considered supervolcanoes because of the vast amount of basalt lava erupted even though the lava flow is non-explosive submarine volcanoes submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor in shallow water active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the oceans surface in the oceans deep the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases however they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water as compared to air which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals over time the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts subglacial volcanoes subglacial volcanoes develop underneath icecaps they are made up of flat lava which flows at the top of extensive pillow lavas and palagonite when the icecap melts the lava on top collapses leaving a flat-topped mountain these volcanoes are also called table mountains tuyas or uncommonly mobergs very good examples of this type of volcano can be seen in iceland however there are also tuyas in british columbia the origin of the term comes from tuya butte which is one of the several tuyas in the area of the tuya river and tuya range in northern british columbia tuya butte was the first such landform analyzed and so its name has entered the geological literature for this kind of volcanic formation the tuya mountains provincial park was recently established to protect this unusual landscape which lies north of tuya lake and south of the jennings river near the boundary with the yukon territory mud volcanoes mud volcanoes or mud domes are formations created by geo-excreted liquids and gases although there are several processes which may cause such activity the largest structures are 10 kilometers in diameter and reach 700 meters high erupted material lava composition another way of classifying volcanoes is by the composition of material erupted lava since this affects the shape of the volcano lava can be broadly classified into four different compositions cas  wright 1987 if the erupted magma contains a high percentage >63 of silica the lava is called felsic felsic lavas dacites or rhyolites tend to be highly viscous not very fluid and are erupted as domes or short stubby flows viscous lavas tend to form stratovolcanoes or lava domes lassen peak in california is an example of a volcano formed from felsic lava and is actually a large lava dome because siliceous magmas are so viscous they tend to trap volatiles gases that are present which cause the magma to erupt catastrophically eventually forming stratovolcanoes pyroclastic flows ignimbrites are highly hazardous products of such volcanoes since they are composed of molten volcanic ash too heavy to go up into the atmosphere so they hug the volcanos slopes and travel far from their vents during large eruptions temperatures as high as 1,200c are known to occur in pyroclastic flows which will incinerate everything flammable in their path and thick layers of hot pyroclastic flow deposits can be laid down often up to many meters thick alaskas valley of ten thousand smokes formed by the eruption of novarupta near katmai in 1912 is an example of a thick pyroclastic flow or ignimbrite deposit volcanic ash that is light enough to be erupted high into the earths atmosphere may travel many kilometres before it falls back to ground as a tuff if the erupted magma contains 52–63 silica the lava is of intermediate composition these andesitic volcanoes generally only occur above subduction zones eg mount merapi in indonesia andesitic lava is typically formed at convergent boundary margins of tectonic plates by several processes hydration melting of peridotite and fractional crystallization play media sarychev peak eruption matua island oblique satellite view melting of subducted slab containing sedimentscitation needed magma mixing between felsic rhyolitic and mafic basaltic magmas in an intermediate reservoir prior to emplacement or lava flow if the erupted magma contains <52 and >45 silica the lava is called mafic because it contains higher percentages of magnesium mg and iron fe or basaltic these lavas are usually much less viscous than rhyolitic lavas depending on their eruption temperature they also tend to be hotter than felsic lavas mafic lavas occur in a wide range of settings at mid-ocean ridges where two oceanic plates are pulling apart basaltic lava erupts as pillows to fill the gap shield volcanoes eg the hawaiian islands including mauna loa and kilauea on both oceanic and continental crust as continental flood basalts some erupted magmas contain =45 silica and produce ultramafic lava ultramafic flows also known as komatiites are very rare indeed very few have been erupted at the earths surface since the proterozoic when the planets heat flow was higher they are or were the hottest lavas and probably more fluid than common mafic lavas felsic lavas dacites or rhyolites tend to be highly viscous not very fluid and are erupted as domes or short stubby flows viscous lavas tend to form stratovolcanoes or lava domes lassen peak in california is an example of a volcano formed from felsic lava and is actually a large lava dome because siliceous magmas are so viscous they tend to trap volatiles gases that are present which cause the magma to erupt catastrophically eventually forming stratovolcanoes

islands including mauna loa and kilauea on both oceanic and continental crust as continental flood basalts lava texture two types of lava are named according to the surface texture ʻaʻa pronounced ˈʔaʔa and pāhoehoe paːˈhoeˈhoe both hawaiian words ʻaʻa is characterized by a rough clinkery surface and is the typical texture of viscous lava flows however even basaltic or mafic flows can be erupted as ʻaʻa flows particularly if the eruption rate is high and the slope is steep pāhoehoe is characterized by its smooth and often ropey or wrinkly surface and is generally formed from more fluid lava flows usually only mafic flows will erupt as pāhoehoe since they often erupt at higher temperatures or have the proper chemical make-up to allow them to flow with greater fluidity volcanic activity popular classification of volcanoes a popular way of classifying magmatic volcanoes is by their frequency of eruptionaccording to whom with those that erupt regularly called active those that have erupted in historical times but are now quiet called dormant or inactive and those that have not erupted in historical times called extinct however these popular classificationsextinct in particularare practically meaningless to scientists they use classifications which refer to a particular volcanos formative and eruptive processes and resulting shapes which was explained above active there is no consensus among volcanologists on how to define an active volcano the lifespan of a volcano can vary from months to several million years making such a distinction sometimes meaningless when compared to the lifespans of humans or even civilizations for example many of earths volcanoes have erupted dozens of times in the past few thousand years but are not currently showing signs of eruption given the long lifespan of such volcanoes they are very active by human lifespans however they are not scientists usually consider a volcano to be erupting or likely to erupt if it is currently erupting or showing signs of unrest such as unusual earthquake activity or significant new gas emissions most scientists consider a volcano active if it has erupted in the last 10,000 years holocene times  the smithsonian global volcanism program uses this definition of active most volcanoes are situated on the pacific ring of fire 10 an estimated 500 million people live near active volcanoes 10 historical time or recorded history is another timeframe for active 11 12 the catalogue of the active volcanoes of the world published by the international association of volcanology uses this definition by which there are more than 500 active volcanoes 11 however the span of recorded history differs from region to region in china and the mediterranean it reaches back nearly 3,000 years but in the pacific northwest of the united states and canada it reaches back less than 300 years and in hawaii and new zealand only around 200 years 11 as of 2013 the following are considered earths most active volcanoes 13 kīlauea the famous hawaiian volcano has been in continuous effusive eruption since 1983 and has the longest-observed lava lake mount etna and nearby stromboli two mediterranean volcanoes in almost continuous eruptionvague since antiquityclarification needed mount yasur in vanuatu has been erupting nearly continuously for over 800 yearscitation needed the longest currently ongoing but not necessarily continuous volcanic eruptive phases are 14 mount yasur 111 years mount etna 109 years stromboli 108 years santa maría 101 years sangay 94 years other very active volcanoes include mount nyiragongo and its neighbor nyamuragira are africas most active volcanoes nyiragongos lava lake  piton de la fournaise in réunion erupts frequently enough to be a tourist attraction erta ale in the afar triangle has maintained a lava lake since at least 1906 mount erebus in antarctica has maintained a lava lake since at least 1972 mount merapi whakaari  white island has been in continuous state of smoking since its discovery in 1769 ol doinyo lengai ambrym arenal volcano pacaya klyuchevskaya sopka sheveluch extinct extinct volcanoes are those that scientists consider unlikely to erupt again because the volcano no longer has a magma supply examples of extinct volcanoes are many volcanoes on the hawaiian  emperor seamount chain in the pacific ocean hohentwiel shiprock and the zuidwal volcano in the netherlands edinburgh castle in scotland is famously located atop an extinct volcano otherwise whether a volcano is truly extinct is often difficult to determine since supervolcano calderas can have eruptive lifespans sometimes measured in millions of years a caldera that has not produced an eruption in tens of thousands of years is likely to be considered dormant instead of extinct some volcanologists refer to extinct volcanoes as inactive though the term is now more commonly used for dormant volcanoes once thought to be extinct dormant it is difficult to distinguish an extinct volcano from a dormant inactive one volcanoes are often considered to be extinct if there are no written records of its activity nevertheless volcanoes may remain dormant for a long period of time for example yellowstone has a reposerecharge period of around 700,000 years and toba of around 380,000 years 15 vesuvius was described by roman writers as having been covered with gardens and vineyards before its eruption of ad 79 which destroyed the towns of herculaneum and pompeii before its catastrophic eruption of 1991 pinatubo was an inconspicuous volcano unknown to most people in the surrounding areas two other examples are the long-dormant soufrière hills volcano on the island of montserrat thought to be extinct before activity resumed in 1995 and fourpeaked mountain in alaska which before its september 2006 eruption had not erupted since before 8000 bc and had long been thought to be extinct technical classification of volcanoes volcanic-alert level the three common popular classifications of volcanoes can be subjective and some volcanoes thought to have been extinct have erupted again to help prevent people from falsely believing they are not at risk when living on or near a volcano countries have adopted new classifications to describe the various levels and stages of volcanic activity 16 some alert systems use different numbers or colors to designate the different stages other systems use colors and words some systems use a combination of both volcano warning schemes of the united states the united states geological survey usgs has adopted a common system nationwide for characterizing the level of unrest and eruptive activity at volcanoes the new volcano alert-level system classifies volcanoes now as being in a normal advisory watch or warning stage additionally colors are used to denote the amount of ash produced details of the us system can be found at volcano warning schemes of the united states decade volcanoes the decade volcanoes are 17 volcanoes identified by the international association of volcanology and chemistry of the earths interior iavcei as being worthy of particular study in light of their history of large destructive eruptions and proximity to populated areas they are named decade volcanoes because the project was initiated as part of the united nations-sponsored international decade for natural disaster reduction the 17 current decade volcanoes are avachinsky-koryaksky grouped together kamchatka russia nevado de colima jalisco and colima

focus of the deep earth carbon degassing project is to use multi-component gas analyzer system instruments to measure co2so2 ratios in real-time and in high-resolution to allow detection of the pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas improving prediction of volcanic activity 17 effects of volcanoes there are many different types of volcanic eruptions and associated activity phreatic eruptions steam-generated eruptions explosive eruption of high-silica lava eg rhyolite effusive eruption of low-silica lava eg basalt pyroclastic flows lahars debris flow and carbon dioxide emission all of these activities can pose a hazard to humans earthquakes hot springs fumaroles mud pots and geysers often accompany volcanic activity volcanic gases the concentrations of different volcanic gases can vary considerably from one volcano to the next water vapor is typically the most abundant volcanic gas followed by carbon dioxide 18 and sulfur dioxide other principal volcanic gases include hydrogen sulfide hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride a large number of minor and trace gases are also found in volcanic emissions for example hydrogen carbon monoxide halocarbons organic compounds and volatile metal chlorides large explosive volcanic eruptions inject water vapor h2o carbon dioxide co2 sulfur dioxide so2 hydrogen chloride hcl hydrogen fluoride hf and ash pulverized rock and pumice into the stratosphere to heights of 16–32 kilometres  10–20mi above the earths surface the most significant impacts from these injections come from the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid h2so4 which condenses rapidly in the stratosphere to form fine sulfate aerosols the so2 emissions alone of two different eruptions are sufficient to compare their potential climatic impact 19 the aerosols increase the earths albedoits reflection of radiation from the sun back into spaceand thus cool the earths lower atmosphere or troposphere however they also absorb heat radiated up from the earth thereby warming the stratosphere several eruptions during the past century have caused a decline in the average temperature at the earths surface of up to half a degree fahrenheit scale for periods of one to three years sulfur dioxide from the eruption of huaynaputina probably caused the russian famine of 1601–1603 20 significant consequences one proposed volcanic winter happened c 70,000 years ago following the supereruption of lake toba on sumatra island in indonesia 21 according to the toba catastrophe theory to which some anthropologists and archeologists subscribe it had global consequences 22 killing most humans then alive and creating a population bottleneck that affected the genetic inheritance of all humans today 23 the 1815 eruption of mount tambora created global climate anomalies that became known as the year without a summer because of the effect on north american and european weather 24 agricultural crops failed and livestock died in much of the northern hemisphere resulting in one of the worst famines of the 19th century 25 the freezing winter of 1740–41 which led to widespread famine in northern europe may also owe its origins to a volcanic eruption 26 it has been suggested that volcanic activity caused or contributed to the end-ordovician permian-triassic late devonian mass extinctions and possibly others the massive eruptive event which formed the siberian traps one of the largest known volcanic events of the last 500million years of earths geological history continued for a million years and is considered to be the likely cause of the great dying about 250 million years ago 27 which is estimated to have killed 90 of species existing at the time 28 acid rain sulfate aerosols promote complex chemical reactions on their surfaces that alter chlorine and nitrogen chemical species in the stratosphere this effect together with increased stratospheric chlorine levels from chlorofluorocarbon pollution generates chlorine monoxide clo which destroys ozone o3 as the aerosols grow and coagulate they settle down into the upper troposphere where they serve as nuclei for cirrus clouds and further modify the earths radiation balance most of the hydrogen chloride hcl and hydrogen fluoride hf are dissolved in water droplets in the eruption cloud and quickly fall to the ground as acid rain the injected ash also falls rapidly from the stratosphere most of it is removed within several days to a few weeks finally explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of carbon for biogeochemical cycles 29 gas emissions from volcanoes are a natural contributor to acid rain volcanic activity releases about 130 to 230 teragrams  145 million to 255 million short tons of carbon dioxide each year 30 volcanic eruptions may inject aerosols into the earths atmosphere large injections may cause visual effects such as unusually colorful sunsets and affect global climate mainly by cooling it volcanic eruptions also provide the benefit of adding nutrients to soil through the weathering process of volcanic rocks these fertile soils assist the growth of plants and various crops volcanic eruptions can also create new islands as the magma cools and solidifies upon contact with the water hazards ash thrown into the air by eruptions can present a hazard to aircraft especially jet aircraft where the particles can be melted by the high operating temperature the melted particles then adhere to the turbine blades and alter their shape disrupting the operation of the turbine dangerous encounters in 1982 after the eruption of galunggung in indonesia and 1989 after the eruption of mount redoubt in alaska raised awareness of this phenomenon nine volcanic ash advisory centers were established by the international civil aviation organization to monitor ash clouds and advise pilots accordingly the 2010 eruptions of eyjafjallajökull caused major disruptions to air travel in europe volcanoes on other celestial bodies the earths moon has no large volcanoes and no current volcanic activity although recent evidence suggests it may still possess a partially molten core 31 however the moon does have many volcanic features such as maria the darker patches seen on the moon rilles and domes the planet venus has a surface that is 90 basalt indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface the planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago 32 from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface lava flows are widespread and forms of volcanism not present on earth occur as well changes in the planets atmosphere and observations of lightning have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions although there is no confirmation of whether or not venus is still volcanically active however radar sounding by the magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at venuss highest volcano maat mons in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank there are several extinct volcanoes on mars four of which are vast shield volcanoes far bigger than any on earth they include arsia mons ascraeus mons hecates tholus olympus mons and pavonis mons these volcanoes have been extinct for many millions of years 33 but the european mars express spacecraft has found evidence that volcanic activity may have occurred on mars in the recent past as well 33 jupiters moon io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system because of tidal interaction with jupiter it is covered with volcanoes that erupt sulfur sulfur dioxide and silicate rock and as a result io is constantly being resurfaced its lavas are the hottest known anywhere in the solar system with temperatures exceeding 1,800 k  1,500c in february 2001 the largest recorded volcanic eruptions in the solar system occurred on io 34 europa the smallest of jupiters galilean moons also appears to have an active volcanic system except that its volcanic activity is entirely in the form of water which freezes into ice on the frigid surface this process is known as cryovolcanism and is apparently most common on the moons of the outer planets of the solar system in 1989 the voyager 2 spacecraft observed cryovolcanoes ice volcanoes on triton a moon of neptune and in 2005 the cassinihuygens probe photographed fountains of frozen particles erupting from enceladus a moon of saturn 35 36 the ejecta may be composed of water liquid nitrogen dust or methane compounds cassinihuygens also found evidence of a methane-spewing cryovolcano on the saturnian moon titan which is believed to be a significant source of the methane found in its atmosphere 37 it is theorized that cryovolcanism may also be present on the kuiper belt object quaoar a 2010 study of the exoplanet corot-7b which was detected by transit in 2009 suggested that tidal heating from the host star very close to the planet and neighboring planets could generate intense volcanic activity similar to that found on io 38 traditional beliefs about volcanoes many ancient accounts ascribe volcanic eruptions to supernatural causes such as the actions of gods or demigods to the ancient greeks volcanoes capricious power could only be explained as acts of the gods while 16th/17th-century german astronomer johannes kepler believed they were ducts for the earths tears 39 one early idea counter to this was proposed by jesuit athanasius kircher  1602–1680 who witnessed eruptions of mount etna and stromboli then visited the crater of vesuvius and published his view of an earth with a central fire connected to numerous others caused by the burning of sulfur bitumen and coal various explanations were proposed for volcano behavior before the modern understanding of the earths mantle structure as a semisolid material was developed for decades after awareness that compression and radioactive materials may be heat sources their contributions were specifically discounted volcanic action was often attributed to chemical reactions and a thin layer of molten rock near the surface
