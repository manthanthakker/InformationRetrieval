in a database when a video is uploaded it is checked against the database and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found 256 when this occurs the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable tracking the viewing statistics of the video or adding advertisements to the video youtube describes content id as very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective id file 256 content id accounts for over a third of the monetized views on youtube 257 an independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to youtube and concluded that while the system was surprisingly resilient in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos it was not infallible 258 the use of content id to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use 259 if a youtube user disagrees with a decision by content id it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision 260 youtube has cited the effectiveness of content id as one of the reasons why the sites rules were modified in december 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length 261 controversial content youtube has also faced criticism over the offensive content in some of its videos the uploading of videos containing defamation pornography and material encouraging criminal conduct is prohibited by youtubes terms of service 233 controversial content has included material relating to holocaust denial and the hillsborough disaster in which 96 football fans from liverpool were crushed to death in 1989 262 263 youtube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate and a youtube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the sites terms of service 233 in july 2008 the culture and media committee of the house of commons of the united kingdom stated that it was unimpressed with youtubes system for policing its videos and argued that proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content youtube responded by stating we have strict rules on whats allowed and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly we educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every youtube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users given the volume of content uploaded on our site we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly 264 july 2008 in october 2010 us congressman anthony weiner urged youtube to remove from its website videos of imam anwar al-awlaki 265 youtube pulled some of the videos in november 2010 stating they violated the sites guidelines 266 in december 2010 youtube added promotes terrorism to the list of reasons that users can give when flagging a video as inappropriate 267 in august 2016 youtube introduced a notification system for a policy restricting the types of content that may be incorporated into videos being monetized providing a means to notify users of these violations and allow them to appeal these restrictions cover content that is not deemed advertiser-friendly including strong violence language sexual content and controversial or sensitive subjects and events including subjects related to war political conflicts natural disasters and tragedies even if graphic imagery is not shown unless the content is usually newsworthy or comedic and the creators intent is to inform or entertain although the policy is not new the issue was brought into prominence by the notification system as well as a video discussing the matter by prominent user philip defranco in which he considered the practice to be censorship on september 1 2016 the hashtag youtubeisoverparty was prominently used on twitter as a means of discussing the controversy a youtube spokesperson stated that while our policy of demonetizing videos due to advertiser-friendly concerns hasnt changed weve recently improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators 268 269 270 user comments most videos enable users to leave comments and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content in 2006 time praised web 2.0 for enabling community and collaboration on a scale never seen before and added that youtube harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom some of the comments on youtube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred 271 the guardian in 2009 described users comments on youtube as in september 2008 the daily telegraph commented that youtube was notorious for some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet and reported on youtube comment snob a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts 273 the huffington post noted in april 2012 that finding comments on youtube that appear offensive stupid and crass to the vast majority of the people is hardly difficult 274 on november 6 2013 google implemented a comment system oriented on google that required all youtube users to use a google account in order to comment on videos the stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone 275 the new system restored the ability to include urls in comments which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse 276 277 in response youtube co-founder jawed karim posted the question why the fuck do i need a google account to comment on a video on his youtube channel to express his negative opinion of the change 278 the official youtube announcement 279 received 20,097 thumbs down votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days 280 writing in the newsday blog silicon island chase melvin noted that google is nowhere near as popular a social media network as facebook but its essentially being forced upon millions of youtube users who dont want to lose their ability to comment on videos and discussion forums across the internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system in the same article melvin goes on to say 281 think of the crude misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on youtube without any discernible moderation isnt any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot the system is far from perfect but google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate youtubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity on july 27 2015 google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a google account to post comments to youtube 282 on november 3 2016 youtube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments 283 view counts in december 2012 two billion views were removed from the view counts of universal and sony music videos on youtube prompting a claim by the daily dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the sites terms of service which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts this was disputed by billboard which said that the two billion views had been moved to vevo since the videos were no longer active on youtube 284 285 on august 5 2015 youtube removed the feature which caused a videos view count to freeze at "301 later "301 until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud 286 youtube view counts now update in real time 287 censorship and filtering as of september 2012 countries with standing national bans on youtube include china iran and turkmenistan youtube is blocked for a variety of reasons including 288

to youtube iran temporarily blocked access on december 3 2006 to youtube and several other sites after declaring them as violating social and moral codes of conduct the youtube block came after a

of youtubes subscription-based music key service the independent music trade organization worldwide independent network alleged that youtube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were undervalued in comparison to other streaming services and that youtube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service in a statement to

platform is governed by its new contractual terms stating that 90 of labels had reached deals he went on to say that while we wish that we had a 100 success rate we understand that is not likely an
