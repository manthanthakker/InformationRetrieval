bangui wind farm bangui wind farm is a wind farm in bangui ilocos norte philippines the wind farm uses 20 units of 70-metre  230ft high vestas v82 1.65mw wind turbines arranged on a single row stretching along a nine-kilometer shoreline off bangui bay facing the west philippine sea phase i of the northwind power project in bangui bay consists of 15 wind turbines each capable of producing electricity up to a maximum capacity of 1.65mw for a total of 24.75mw the 15 on-shore turbines are spaced 326 metres  1,070ft apart each 70 metres  230ft high with 41 metres  135ft long blades with a rotor diameter of 82 metres  269ft and a wind swept area of 5,281 square metres  56,840sqft phase ii was completed on august 2008 and added 5 more wind turbines with the same capacity and brought the total capacity to 33mw all 20 turbines describes a graceful arc reflecting the shoreline of bangui bay facing the west philippine sea  contents 1 location 2 history 3 see also 4 external links  locationedit the northwind bangui bay project is located at the municipality of bangui ilocos norte philippines located at the north-west tip of luzon island the windmills face the sea from where the wind blows towards the land its location along the shore is optimal in removing windbreaks and has a terrain roughness of 0 the site is free of any trees and vegetation and stretches approximately 9 kilometres  5.6mi long and 100 metres  330ft wide the area is undeveloped and uninhabited making it ideal as a site and poses no threat to the environment the location of the philippines being near the asia-pacific monsoon belt is ideal for installing wind turbines the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration attests that the philippines has a mean average of about 31 watts per square meter wm2 of wind power density historyedit in 1996 the national renewable energy laboratory nrel conducted a wind resource analysis and mapping study it concluded that various areas in the philippines are ideal for wind power installation these areas include bangui and burgos towns in ilocos norte batanes and babuyan islands which are north of luzon and the higher interior terrain of mindoro samar leyte panay negros cebu palawan and eastern mindanao the study led to the inception of the wind farm project northwind power development corp developed and maintains and operates the project while vestas wind systems a danish firm supplied the wind turbine-generator units wtgs for the site similar to those already found in denmark the project was to have been developed in three phases phase i of the project erected 15 wind turbines spaced 236 meters apart on-shore this was inaugurated on june 18 2005 and attended by former first lady imelda marcos then governor bongbong marcos former doe secretary vincent perez undersecretary peter abaya and dr robert yap jesuit priest and project director of cd4cdm project of klima who also conducted the invocation and blessing of the wind turbines ratified by the northwind power development corp and the international bank for reconstruction and development through the world bank prototype carbon fund the northwind bangui bay project was the first project in the philippines to have the emissions reduction purchase agreement erpa under the clean development mechanism the bangui bay project is also the first philippine recipient of the carbon emission reduction certificates cers from the executive board of the united nations framework convention on climate change in 2006 the project produced a 5 discount of the weighted average price in the wholesale electricity spot market wesm or a generated savings of approximately usd1.4 million php 70 million for the inec electricity consumers the project cost for phase i amounted to usd$23 million phase ii was completed in june 2008 adding 5 more wind turbines carrying the same capacity as those in phase i and raising the total capacity to 33mw all of these formed the arc of bangui bay a fusion of technological and natural elegance phase ii raises the projects power contribution to ilocos norte from 40 to 50 phase iii is expected to raise the total expenditure for the whole project to usd$54 million northwind power devt corp has started the construction of phase iii of the project where 6 new wind turbines will be erected with a total of 18 mw installed capacity siemens swt 108 3.0 mw will be installed in phase 3 where each wind turbines have an installed capacity of 3 mw and a rotor diameter of 108 meters the project is targeted to be completed in the middle of 2014 see alsoedit sustainable energy wind energy power system philippines wind farm external linksedit media related to bangui wind farm at wikimedia commons httpwwwnorthwindspowercom v t e bangui burgos caparispisan mindoro pililla
