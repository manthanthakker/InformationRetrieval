uk ˈmiːθeɪn is a chemical compound with the chemical formula ch4 one atom of carbon and four atoms of hydrogen it is a group 14 hydride and the simplest alkane and is the main component of natural gas the relative abundance of methane on earth makes it an attractive fuel though capturing and storing it poses challenges due to its gaseous state under normal conditions for temperature and pressure in its natural state methane is found both below ground and under the sea floor when it finds its way to the surface and the atmosphere it is known as atmospheric methane 5 the earths atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150 since 1750 and it accounts for 20 of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases these gases dont include water

identified by italian physicist alessandro volta in the marshes of lake maggiore straddling italy and switzerland volta was inspired to search for the substance after reading a paper written by benjamin franklin about flammable air 7 volta captured the gas rising from the marsh and by 1778 had isolated the pure gas 8 he also demonstrated means to ignite the gas with an electric spark 8 the name methane was coined in 1866 by the german chemist august wilhelm von hofmann 9 properties and bondingedit methane is a tetrahedral molecule with four equivalent ch bonds its electronic structure is described by four bonding molecular orbitals mos resulting from the overlap of the valence orbitals on c and h the lowest energy mo is the result of the overlap of the 2s orbital on carbon with the in-phase combination of the 1s orbitals on the four hydrogen atoms above this energy level is a triply degenerate set of mos that involve overlap of the 2p orbitals on carbon with various linear combinations of the 1s orbitals on hydrogen the resulting three-over-one bonding scheme is consistent with photoelectron spectroscopic measurements at room temperature and standard pressure methane is a colorless odorless gas 10 the familiar smell of natural gas as used in homes is achieved by the addition of an odorant usually blends containing tert-butylthiol as a safety measure methane has a boiling point of −161 c −257.8 f at a pressure of one atmosphere 11 as a gas it is flammable over a range of concentrations  5.4–17 in air at standard pressure solid methane exists in several modifications presently nine are known 12 cooling methane at normal pressure results in the formation of methane i this substance crystallizes in the cubic system space group fm3m the positions of the hydrogen atoms are not fixed in methane i ie methane molecules may rotate freely therefore it is a plastic crystal 13 chemical reactionsedit the primary chemical reactions of methane are combustion steam reforming to syngas and halogenation in general methane reactions are difficult to control partial oxidation to methanol for example is challenging because the reaction typically progresses all the way to carbon dioxide and water even with an insufficient supply of oxygen the enzyme methane monooxygenase produces methanol from methane but cannot be used for industrial-scale reactions 14 acid-base reactionsedit like other hydrocarbons methane is a very weak acid its pka in dmso is estimated to be 56 15 it cannot be deprotonated in solution but the conjugate base with methyllithium is known a variety of positive ions derived from methane have been observed mostly as unstable species in low-pressure gas mixtures these include methenium or methyl cation ch 3 methane cation ch 4 and methanium or protonated methane ch 5 some of these have been detected in outer space methanium can also be produced as diluted solutions from methane with superacids cations with higher charge such as ch2 6 and ch3 7 have been studied theoretically and conjectured to be stable 16 despite the strength of its ch bonds there is intense interest in catalysts that facilitate ch bond activation in methane and other lower numbered alkanes 17 combustionedit methanes heat of combustion is 55.5 mjkg 18 combustion of methane is a multiple step reaction the following equations are part of the process with the net result being ch4  2 o2  co2  2 h2o δh  −891 k jmol at standard conditions the species m signifies an energetic third body from which energy is transferred during a molecular collision formaldehyde hcho or h 2co is an early intermediate reaction 7 oxidation of formaldehyde gives the formyl radical hco reactions 8–10 which then give carbon monoxide co reactions 11 12  13 any resulting h2 oxidizes to h2o or other intermediates reaction 14 15 finally the co oxidizes forming co2 reaction 16 in the final stages reactions 17–19 energy is transferred back to other third bodies the overall speed of reaction is a function of the concentration of the various entities during the combustion process the higher the temperature the greater the concentration of radical species and the more rapid the combustion process 19 reactions with halogensedit given appropriate conditions methane reacts with halogens as follows where x is a halogen fluorine f chlorine cl bromine br or iodine i this mechanism for this process is called free radical halogenation it is initiated with uv light or some other radical initiator a chlorine atom is generated from elemental chlorine which abstracts a hydrogen atom from methane resulting in the formation of hydrogen chloride the resulting methyl radical ch3 can combine with another chlorine molecule to give methyl chloride ch3cl and a chlorine atom this chlorine atom can then react with another methane or methyl chloride molecule repeating the chlorination cycle 20 similar reactions can produce dichloromethane ch2cl2 chloroform chcl3 and ultimately carbon tetrachloride ccl4 depending upon reaction conditions and the chlorine to methane ratio usesedit methane is used in industrial chemical processes and may be transported as a refrigerated liquid liquefied natural gas or lng while leaks from a refrigerated liquid container are initially heavier than air due to the increased density of the cold gas the gas at ambient temperature is lighter than air gas pipelines distribute large amounts of natural gas of which methane is the principal component fueledit methane is used as a fuel for ovens homes water heaters kilns automobiles 21 22 turbines and other things it combusts with oxygen to create fire natural gasedit methane is important for electrical generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator compared to other hydrocarbon fuels methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released at about 891 kjmol methanes heat of combustion is lower than any other hydrocarbon but the ratio of the heat of combustion  891 kjmol to the molecular mass  16.0 gmol of which 12.0 gmol is carbon shows that methane being the simplest hydrocarbon produces more heat per mass unit  55.7 kjg than other complex hydrocarbons in many cities methane is piped into homes for domestic heating and cooking in this context it is usually known as natural gas which is considered to have an energy content of 39 megajoules per cubic meter or 1,000 btu per standard cubic foot methane in the form of compressed natural gas is used as a vehicle fuel and is claimed to be more environmentally friendly than other fossil fuels such as gasolinepetrol and diesel 22 research into adsorption methods of methane storage for use as an automotive fuel has been conducted 23 liquefied natural gasedit liquefied natural gas lng is natural gas predominantly methane ch4 that has been converted to liquid form for ease of storage or transport liquefied natural gas takes up about 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state it is odorless colorless non-toxic and non-corrosive hazards include flammability after vaporization into a gaseous state freezing and asphyxia the liquefaction process involves removal of certain components such as dust acid gases helium water and heavy hydrocarbons which could cause difficulty downstream the natural gas is then condensed into a liquid at close to atmospheric pressure maximum transport pressure set at around 25kpa or 3.6psi by cooling it to approximately −162c −260fcitation needed lng achieves a higher reduction in volume than compressed natural gas cng so that the energy density of lng is 2.4times greater than that of cng or 60 that of diesel fuel 24 this makes lng cost efficient to transport over long distances where pipelines do not exist specially designed cryogenic sea vessels lng carriers or cryogenic road tankers are used for its transport lng when it is not highly refined for special uses is principally used for transporting natural gas to markets where it is regasified and distributed as pipeline natural gas it is also beginning to be used in lng-fueled road vehicles for example trucks in commercial operation have been achieving payback periods of approximately four years on the higher initial investment required in lng equipment on the trucks and lng infrastructure to support fueling 25 however it remains more common to design vehicles to use compressed natural gas as of 2002update the relatively higher cost of lng production and the need to store lng in more expensive cryogenic tanks had slowed widespread commercial use 26 liquid methane rocket fueledit in a highly refined form liquid methane is used as a rocket fuel 27 though methane has been investigated for decades no production methane engines have yet been used on orbital spaceflights 28 this promises to change as liquid methane has recently been selected for the active development of a variety of bipropellant rocket engines since the 1990s a number of russian rockets using liquid methane have been proposed 29 30 one 1990s russian engine proposal was the rd-192 a methanelox variant of the rd-191 30 in 2005 us companies orbitech and xcor aerospace developed a demonstration liquid oxygenliquid methane rocket engine and a larger 7,500 pounds-force  33kn-thrust engine in 2007 for potential use as the cev lunar return engine before the cev program was later cancelled 31 32 33 more recently the american private space company spacex announced in 2012 an initiative to develop liquid methane rocket engines 34 including initially the very large raptor rocket engine 35 raptor is being designed to produce 4.4 meganewtons  1,000,000lbf of thrust with a vacuum specific impulse isp of 363 seconds and a sea-level isp of 321 seconds 36 and began component-level testing in 2014 37 in february 2014 the raptor engine design was shown to be of the highly efficient and theoretically more reliable full-flow staged combustion cycle type where both propellant streamsoxidizer and fuelare completely in the gas phase before they enter the combustion chamber prior to 2014 only two full-flow rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands but neither engine completed development or flew on a flight vehicle 36 in 2016 a development raptor engine was tested 38 in october 2013 the china aerospace science and technology corporation a state-owned contractor for the chinese space program announced that it had completed a first ignition test on a new lox methane rocket engine no engine size was provided 39 in september 2014 another american private space companyblue origin publicly announced that they were into their third year of development work on a large methane rocket engine the new engine the blue engine 4 or be-4 has been designed to produce 2,400 kilonewtons  550,000lbf of thrust while initially planned to be used exclusively on a blue origin proprietary launch vehicle it will now be used on a new united launch alliance ula engine on an new launch vehicle that is a successor to the atlas v ula indicated in 2014 that they will make the maiden flight of the new launch vehicle no earlier than 2019 40 one advantage of methane is that it is abundant in many parts of the solar system and it could potentially be harvested on the surface of another solar-system body in particular using methane production from local materials found on mars 41 or titan providing fuel for a return journey 27 42 by 2013 nasas project morpheus had developed a small restartable lox methane rocket engine with 5,000 pounds-force  22kn thrust and a specific impulse of 321 seconds suitable for inspace applications including landers small lox methane thrusters 5–15 pounds-force  22–67n were also developed suitable for use in a reaction control system rcs 43 44 spacenews is reporting in early 2015 that the french space agency cnes is working with germany and a few other governments and will propose a loxmethane engine on a reusable launch vehicle by mid-2015needs update with flight testing unlikely before approximately 2026 45 chemical feedstockedit although there is great interest in converting methane into useful or more easily liquefied compounds the only practical processes are relatively unselective in the chemical industry methane is converted to synthesis gas a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen by steam reforming this endergonic process requiring energy utilizes nickel catalysts and requires high temperatures around 700–1100c related chemistries are exploited in the haber-bosch synthesis of ammonia from air which is reduced with natural gas to a mixture of carbon dioxide water and ammonia methane is also subjected to free-radical chlorination in the production of chloromethanes although methanol is a more typical precursor 46 in recent years there have been reports of further commercially viable processes leveraging methane as a chemical feedstock eg based on the oxidative coupling of methane the catalytic oxidation of methane into methanol 47 and the direct reaction of methane with sulfur trioxide 48 49 despite significant research efforts incl venture capital financing efforts continue to focus on pilot and demo plant-level as of 2016 only the startup of an industrial scale production plant for methanesulfonic acid via direct reaction of methane with sulfur trioxide has been communicated for 2019 49 productionedit biological routesedit naturally occurring methane is mainly produced by the process of methanogenesis this multistep process is used by microorganisms as an energy source the net reaction is the final step in the process is catalyzed by the enzyme coenzyme-b sulfoethylthiotransferase methanogenesis is a form of anaerobic respiration used by organisms that occupy landfill ruminants eg cattle and the guts of termites it is uncertain if plants are a source of methane emissions 50 51 52 power to gasedit power to gas is a technology which converts electrical power to a gas fuel the method is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane see natural gas using electrolysis and the sabatier reactionclarification needed excess and off-peak power generated by wind generators and solar arrays could theoretically be used for load balancing in the energy gridcitation needed industrial routesedit methane can be produced by hydrogenating carbon dioxide through the sabatier process methane is also a side product of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide in the fischer-tropsch process this technology is practiced on a large scale to produce longer chain molecules than methane natural gas is so abundant that the intentional production of methane is relatively rare the only large scale facility of this kind is the great plains synfuels plant started in 1984 in beulah north dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low grade lignite a resource which is otherwise very hard to transport for its weight ash content low calorific value and propensity to spontaneous combustion during storage and transport laboratory synthesisedit methane can also be produced by the destructive distillation of acetic acid in the presence of soda lime or similar acetic acid is decarboxylated in this process methane can also be prepared by reaction of aluminium carbide with water or strong acids it is also made by reducing a solution of methanol and concentrated hydrochloric acid with iron powder giving water and ferrous chloride as a byproduct on marsedit methane has been proposed as a possible rocket propellant on future mars missions due in part to the possibility of synthesizing it on the planet via in situ resource utilization 53 an adaptation of the sabatier methanation reaction may be used via a mixed catalyst bed and a reverse water gas shift in a single reactor to produce methane from the raw materials available on mars utilizing water from the martian subsoil and carbon dioxide in the martian atmosphere 41 methane could also be produced by a non-biological process called serpentinizationa involving water carbon dioxide and the mineral olivine which is known to be common on mars 54 occurrenceedit methane was discovered and isolated by alessandro volta between 1776 and 1778 when studying marsh gas from lake maggiore it is the major component of natural gas about 87 by volume the major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as natural gas fields with coal seam gas extraction becoming a major source see coal bed methane extraction a method for extracting methane from a coal deposit while enhanced coal bed methane recovery is a method of recovering methane from non-mineable coal seams it is associated with other hydrocarbon fuels and sometimes accompanied by helium and nitrogen methane is produced at shallow levels low pressure by anaerobic decay of organic matter and reworked methane from deep under the earths surface in general the sediments that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain oil methane is generally transported in bulk by pipeline in its natural gas form or lng carriers in its liquefied form few countries transport it by truck alternative sourcesedit apart from gas fields an alternative method of obtaining methane is via biogas generated by the fermentation of organic matter including manure wastewater sludge municipal solid waste including landfills or any other biodegradable feedstock under anaerobic conditions rice fields also generate large amounts of methane during plant growth methane hydratesclathrates ice-like combinations of methane and water on the sea floor found in vast quantities are a potential future source of methane cattle belch methane accounts for 16 of the worlds annual methane emissions to the atmosphere 55 one study reported that the livestock sector in general primarily cattle chickens and pigs produces 37 of all human-induced methane 56 early research has found a number of medical treatments and dietary adjustments that help slightly limit the production of methane in ruminants 57 58 a 2009 study found that at a conservative estimate at least 51 of global greenhouse gas emissions were attributable to the life cycle and supply chain of livestock products meaning all meat dairy and by-products and their transportation 59 more recently a 2013 study estimated that livestock accounted for 44 percent of human-induced methane and 14.5 percent of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions 60 many efforts are underway to reduce livestock methane production and trap the gas to use as energy 61 paleoclimatology research published in current biology suggests that flatulence from dinosaurs may have warmed the earth 62 atmospheric methaneedit  methane is created near the earths surface primarily by microorganisms by the process of methanogenesis it is carried into the stratosphere by rising air in the tropics uncontrolled build-up of methane in the atmosphere is naturally checked although human influence can upset this natural regulation by methanes reaction with hydroxyl radicals formed from singlet oxygen atoms and with water vapor it has a net lifetime of about 10 years 63 and is primarily removed by conversion to carbon dioxide and water in addition there is a large but unknown amount of methane in methane clathrates in the ocean floors as well as the earths crust in 2010 methane levels in the arctic were measured at 1850 nmolmol a level over twice as high as at any time in the 400,000 years prior to the industrial revolution historically methane concentrations in the worlds atmosphere have ranged between 300 and 400 nmolmol during glacial periods commonly known as ice ages and between 600 and 700 nmolmol during the warm interglacial periods recent research suggests that the earths oceans are a potentially important new source of arctic methane 64 methane is an important greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 34 compared to co2 over a 100-year period and 72 over a 20-year period 65 66 67 the earths atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150 since 1750 and it accounts for 20 of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases these gases dont include water vapor which is by far the largest component of the greenhouse effect 6 clathratesedit methane is essentially insoluble in water but it can be trapped in ice forming a similar solid significant deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of earth at large depths arctic methane release from permafrost and methane clathrates is an expected consequence and further cause of global warming 68 69 70 anaerobic oxidation of methaneedit there is a group of bacteria that drive methane oxidation with nitrite as the oxidant the anaerobic oxidation of methane 71 safetyedit methane is nontoxic yet it is extremely flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air methane is violently reactive with oxidizers halogen and some halogen-containing compounds methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space asphyxia may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16 by displacement as most people can tolerate a reduction from 21 to 16 without ill effects the concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant is much higher than the 5–15 concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near landfills and expose occupants to significant levels of methane some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building methane gas explosions are responsible for many deadly mining disasters 72 a methane gas explosion was the cause of the upper big branch coal mine disaster in west virginia on april 5 2010 killing 25 73 extraterrestrial methaneedit methane has been detected or is believed to exist on all planets of the solar system and most of the larger moons with the possible exceptions of mars and titan it is believed to have come from abiotic processes mercury  the tenuous atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane 74 venus  the atmosphere contains a large amount of methane from 60km  37mi to the surface according to data collected by the pioneer venus large probe neutral mass spectrometer 75 moon  traces are outgassed from the surface 76 mars  the martian atmosphere contains 10 nmolmol methane 77 the source of methane on mars has not been determined recent research suggests that methane may come from volcanoes fault lines or methanogens 78 that it may be a byproduct of electrical discharges from dust devils and dust storms 79 or that it may be the result of uv radiation 80 in january 2009 nasa scientists announced that they had discovered that the planet often vents methane into the atmosphere in specific areas leading some to speculate this may be a sign of biological activity below the surface 81 studies of a weather research and forecasting model for mars marswrf and related mars general circulation model mgcm suggests that methane plume sources may be located within tens of kilometers which is within the roving capabilities of future mars rovers 82 the curiosity rover which landed on mars in august 2012 can distinguish between different isotopologues of methane 83 but even if the mission determines that microscopic martian life is the source of the methane it probably resides far below the surface beyond the rovers reach 84 curiositys sample analysis at mars sam instrument is capable of tracking the presence of methane over time to determine if it is constant variable seasonal or random providing further clues about its source 85 the first measurements with the tunable laser spectrometer tls indicated that there is less than 5 ppb of methane at the landing site 86 87 88 89 methane measurements in the atmosphere of mars by the curiosity rover the mars trace gas mission orbiter planned for launch in 2016 would further study mars methane 90 91 and its decomposition products such as formaldehyde and methanol alternatively these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means such as serpentinization 54 on july 19 2013 nasa scientists reported finding not much methane ie an upper limit of 2.7 parts per billion of methane around the gale crater where the curiosity rover landed in august 2012 92 93 94 on september 19 2013 from further measurements by curiosity nasa scientists reported no detection of atmospheric methane with a value of 6999180000000000000♠0.18±0.67 ppbv corresponding to an upper limit of only 1.3 ppbv  95 confidence limit and as a result concluded that the probability of current methanogenic microbial activity on mars is reduced 95 96 97 on 16 december 2014 nasa reported the curiosity rover detected a tenfold spike likely localized in the amount of methane in the martian atmosphere sample measurements taken a dozen times over 20 months showed increases in late 2013 and early 2014 averaging "7 parts of methane per billion in the atmosphere before and after that readings averaged around one-tenth that level
