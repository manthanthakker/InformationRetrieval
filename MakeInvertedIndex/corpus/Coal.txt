coal coal old english col meaning mineral of fossilized carbon since the thirteenth century is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams the harder forms such as anthracite coal can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure coal is composed primarily of carbon along with variable quantities of other elements chiefly hydrogen sulfur oxygen and nitrogen 1 a fossil fuel coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat which in turn is converted into lignite then sub-bituminous coal after that bituminous coal and lastly anthracite this involves biological and geological processes that take place over time throughout history coal has been used as an energy resource primarily burned for the production of electricity and heat and is also used for industrial purposes such as refining metals coal is the largest source of energy for the generation of electricity worldwide as well as one of the largest worldwide anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide releases the extraction of coal its use in energy production and its byproducts are all associated with environmental and health effects including climate change 2 coal is extracted from the ground by coal mining since 1983 the worlds top coal producer has been china 3 in 2011 china produced 3,520 million tonnes of coal  49.5 of 7,695 million tonnes world coal production in 2011 other large producers were united states  993 million tonnes india  589 european union  576 and australia  416 3 in 2010 the largest exporters were australia with 328 million tonnes  27.1 of world coal export and indonesia with 316 million tonnes  26.1 4 while the largest importers were

hypothesized to come from the proto-indo-european root geu-lo- live coal 6 germanic cognates include the old frisian kole middle dutch cole dutch kool old high german chol german kohle and old norse kol and the irish word gual is also a cognate via the indo-european root 6 in old turkic languages kül is ashes cinders öčür is quench the compound charcoal in turkic is öčürülmüş kül literally quenched ashes cinders coals with elided anlaut ö- and inflection affixes -ülmüş 7 the word took on the meaning mineral consisting of fossilized carbon in the thirteenth century 6 formationedit at various times in the geologic past the earth had dense forests in low-lying wetland areas due to natural processes such as flooding these forests were buried underneath soil as more and more soil deposited over them they were compressed the temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper as the process continued the plant matter was protected from biodegradation and oxidation usually by mud or acidic water this trapped the carbon in immense peat bogs that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments under high pressure and high temperature dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal as coal contains mainly carbon the conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonization 8 the wide shallow seas of the carboniferous period provided ideal conditions for coal formation although coal is known from most geological periods the exception is the coal gap in the permiantriassic extinction event where coal is rare coal is known from precambrian strata which predate land plants  this coal is presumed to have originated from residues of algae 9 10 ranksedit as geological processes apply pressure to dead biotic material over time under suitable conditions its metamorphic grade increases successively into peat considered to be a precursor of coal has industrial importance as a fuel in some regions for example ireland and finland in its dehydrated form peat is a highly effective absorbent for fuel and oil spills on land and water it is also used as a conditioner for soil to make it more able to retain and slowly release water lignite or brown coal is the lowest rank of coal and used almost exclusively as fuel for electric power generation jet a compact form of lignite is sometimes polished and has been used as an ornamental stone since the upper palaeolithic sub-bituminous coal whose properties range from those of lignite to those of bituminous coal is used primarily as fuel for steam-electric power generation and is an important source of light aromatic hydrocarbons for the chemical synthesis industry bituminous coal is a dense sedimentary rock usually black but sometimes dark brown often with well-defined bands of bright and dull material it is used primarily as fuel in steam-electric power generation with substantial quantities used for heat and power applications in manufacturing and to make coke steam coal is a grade between bituminous coal and anthracite once widely used as a fuel for steam locomotives in this specialized use it is sometimes known as sea coal in the us 11 small steam coal dry small steam nuts or dssn was used as a fuel for domestic water heating anthracite the highest rank of coal is a harder glossy black coal used primarily for residential and commercial space heating it may be divided further into metamorphically altered bituminous coal and petrified oil as from the deposits in pennsylvania graphite is one of the more difficult coals to ignite and is not commonly used as fuel  it is mostly used in pencils and when powdered as a lubricant the classification of coal is generally based on the content of volatiles however the exact classification varies between countries according to the german classification coal is classified as follows 12 the middle six grades in the table represent a progressive transition from the english-language sub-bituminous to bituminous coal while the last class is an approximate equivalent to anthracite but more inclusive us anthracite has  6 volatiles cannel coal sometimes called candle coal is a variety of fine-grained high-rank coal with significant hydrogen content it consists primarily of exinite macerals now termed liptinite hilts lawedit hilts law is a geological term that states that in a small area the deeper the coal the higher its rank grade the law holds true if the thermal gradient is entirely vertical but metamorphism may cause lateral changes of rank irrespective of depth contentedit early uses as fueledit the earliest recognized use is from the shenyang area of china 4000 bc where neolithic inhabitants had begun carving ornaments from black lignite 16 coal from the fushun mine in northeastern china was used to smelt copper as early as 1000 bce 17 marco polo the italian who traveled to china in the 13th century described coal as black stones which burn like logs and said coal was so plentiful people could take three hot baths a week 18 in europe the earliest reference to the use of coal as fuel is from the geological treatise on stones lap 16 by the greek scientist theophrastus circa 371–287 bc 19 20 among the materials that are dug because they are useful those known as anthrakes coals are made of earth and once set on fire they burn like charcoal they are found in liguria and in elis as one approaches olympia by the mountain road and they are used by those who work in metals outcrop coal was used in britain during the bronze age  3000–2000 bc where it has been detected as forming part of the composition of funeral pyres 21 22 in roman britain with the exception of two modern fields the romans were exploiting coals in all the major coalfields in england and wales by the end of the second century ad 23 evidence of trade in coal dated to about ad 200 has been found at the roman settlement at heronbridge near chester and in the fenlands of east anglia where coal from the midlands was transported via the car dyke for use in drying grain 24 coal cinders have been found in the hearths of villas and roman forts particularly in northumberland dated to around ad 400 in the west of england contemporary writers described the wonder of a permanent brazier of coal on the altar of minerva at aquae sulis modern day bath although in fact easily accessible surface coal from what became the somerset coalfield was in common use in quite lowly dwellings locally 25 evidence of coals use for iron-working in the city during the roman period has been found 26 in eschweiler rhineland deposits of bituminous coal were used by the romans for the smelting of iron ore 23 no evidence exists of the product being of great importance in britain before the high middle ages after about ad 1000 27 mineral coal came to be referred to as seacoal in the 13th century the wharf where the material arrived in london was known as seacoal lane so identified in a charter of king henry iii granted in 1253 28 initially the name was given because much coal was found on the shore having fallen from the exposed coal seams on cliffs above or washed out of underwater coal outcrops 27 but by the time of henry viii it was understood to derive from the way it was carried to london by sea 29 in 1257–59 coal from newcastle upon tyne was shipped to london for the smiths and lime-burners building westminster abbey 27 seacoal lane and newcastle lane where coal was unloaded at wharves along the river fleet are still in existence 30 see industrial processes below for modern uses of the term these easily accessible sources had largely become exhausted or could not meet the growing demand by the 13th century when underground extraction by shaft mining or adits was developed 21 the alternative name was pitcoal because it came from mines it was however the development of the industrial revolution that led to the large-scale use of coal as the steam engine took over from the water wheel in 1700 five-sixths of the worlds coal was mined in britain britain would have run out of suitable sites for watermills by the 1830s if coal had not been available as a source of energy 31 in 1947 there were some 750,000 miners in britain 32 but by 2004 this had shrunk to some 5,000 miners working in around 20 collieries 33 uses todayedit coal as fueledit coal is primarily used as a solid fuel to produce electricity and heat through combustion world coal consumption was about 7.25 billion tonnes in 2010 34  7.99 billion short tons and is expected to increase 48 to 9.05 billion tonnes  9.98 billion short tons by 2030 35 china produced 3.47 billion tonnes  3.83 billion short tons in 2011 india produced about 578 million tonnes  637.1 million short tons in 2011 68.7 of chinas electricity comes from coal the usa consumed about 13 of the world total in 2010 ie 951 million tonnes  1.05 billion short tons using 93 of it for generation of electricity 36 46 of total power generated in the usa was done using coal 37 the united states energy information administration estimates coal reserves at 7011948000000000000♠948×109 short tons  860 gt 38 one estimate for resources is 18,000 gt 39 when coal is used for electricity generation it is usually pulverized and then combusted burned in a furnace with a boiler 40 the furnace heat converts boiler water to steam which is then used to spin turbines which turn generators and create electricity 41 the thermodynamic efficiency of this process has been improved over time some older coal-fired power stations have thermal efficiencies in the vicinity of 25 42 whereas the newest supercritical and ultra-supercritical steam cycle turbines operating at temperatures over 600c and pressures over 27 mpa over 3900 psi can practically achieve thermal efficiencies in excess of 45 lhv basis using anthracite fuel 43 44 or around 43 lhv basis even when using lower-grade lignite fuel 45 further thermal efficiency improvements are also achievable by improved pre-drying especially relevant with high-moisture fuel such as lignite or biomass and cooling technologies 46 an alternative approach of using coal for electricity generation with improved efficiency is the integrated gasification combined cycle igcc power plant instead of pulverizing the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the steam-generating boiler the coal can be first gasified see coal gasification to create syngas which is burned in a gas turbine to produce electricity just like natural gas is burned in a turbine hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to raise steam in a heat recovery steam generator which powers a supplemental steam turbine thermal efficiencies of current igcc power plants range from 39 to 42 47 hhv basis or ~42–45 lhv basis for bituminous coal and assuming utilization of mainstream gasification technologies shell ge gasifier cbi igcc power plants outperform conventional pulverized coal-fueled plants in terms of pollutant emissions and allow for relatively easy carbon capture at least 40 of the worlds electricity comes from coal 40 48 and in 2012 about one-third of the united states electricity came from coal down from approximately 49 in 2008 49 50 as of 2012 in the united states use of coal to generate electricity was declining as plentiful supplies of natural gas obtained by hydraulic fracturing of tight shale formations became available at low prices 49 in denmark a net electric efficiency of  47 has been obtained at the coal-fired nordjyllandsværket chp plant and an overall plant efficiency of up to 91 with cogeneration of electricity and district heating 51 the multifuel-fired avedøreværket chp plant just outside copenhagen can achieve a net electric efficiency as high as 49 the overall plant efficiency with cogeneration of electricity and district heating can reach as much as 94 52 an alternative form of coal combustion is as coal-water slurry fuel cws which was developed in the soviet union cws significantly reduces emissions improving the heating value of coalcitation needed other ways to use coal are combined heat and power cogeneration and an mhd topping cycle the total known deposits recoverable by current technologies including highly polluting low-energy content types of coal ie lignite bituminous is sufficient for many yearsquantify however consumption is increasing and maximal production could be reached within decades see world coal reserves below on the other hand much may have to be left in the ground to avoid climate change 53 54 coking coal and use of cokeedit coke is a solid carbonaceous residue derived from low-ash low-sulfur bituminous coal metallurgical coal from which the volatile constituents are driven off by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000c  1,832f so the fixed carbon and residual ash are fused together metallurgical coke is used as a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace 55 the result is pig iron and is too rich in dissolved carbon so it must be treated further to make steel the coking coal should be low in sulfur and phosphorus so they do not migrate to the metal based on the ash percentage the coking coal can be divided into various grades these grades are steel grade i ash content not exceeding 15 steel grade ii exceeding 15 but not exceeding 18 washery grade i exceeding 18 but not exceeding 21 washery grade ii exceeding 21 but not exceeding 24 washery grade iii exceeding 24 but not exceeding 28 washery grade iv exceeding 28 but not exceeding 35 56 the coke must be strong enough to resist the weight of overburden in the blast furnace which is why coking coal is so important in making steel using the conventional route however the alternative route is direct reduced iron where any carbonaceous fuel can be used to make sponge or pelletised iron coke from coal is grey hard and porous and has a heating value of 24.8 million btuton  29.6 mjkg some cokemaking processes produce valuable byproducts including coal tar ammonia light oils and coal gas petroleum coke is the solid residue obtained in oil refining which resembles coke but contains too many impurities to be useful in metallurgical applications gasificationedit coal gasification can be used to produce syngas a mixture of carbon monoxide co and hydrogen h2 gas often syngas is used to fire gas turbines to produce electricity but the versatility of syngas also allows it to be converted into transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel through the fischer-tropsch process alternatively syngas can be converted into methanol which can be blended into fuel directly or converted to gasoline via the methanol to gasoline process 57 gasification combined with fischer-tropsch technology is currently used by the sasol chemical company of south africa to make motor vehicle fuels from coal and natural gas alternatively the hydrogen obtained from gasification can be used for various purposes such as powering a hydrogen economy making ammonia or upgrading fossil fuels during gasification the coal is mixed with oxygen and steam while also being heated and pressurized during the reaction oxygen and water molecules oxidize the coal into carbon monoxide co while also releasing hydrogen gas h2 this process has been conducted in both underground coal mines and in the production of town gas if the refiner wants to produce gasoline the syngas is collected at this state and routed into a fischer-tropsch reaction if hydrogen is the desired end-product however the syngas is fed into the water gas shift reaction where more hydrogen is liberated in the past coal was converted to make coal gas town gas which was piped to customers to burn for illumination heating and cooking liquefactionedit coal can also be converted into synthetic fuels equivalent to gasoline or diesel by several different direct processes which do not intrinsically require gasification or indirect conversion 58 in the direct liquefaction processes the coal is either hydrogenated or carbonized hydrogenation processes are the bergius process 59 the src-i and src-ii solvent refined coal processes the nus corporation hydrogenation process 60 61 and several other single-stage and two-stage processes 62 in the process of low-temperature carbonization coal is coked at temperatures between 360 and 750c  680 and 1,380f these temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar the coal tar is then further processed into fuels an overview of coal liquefaction and its future potential is available 63 coal liquefaction methods involve carbon dioxide co2 emissions in the conversion process if coal liquefaction is done without employing either carbon capture and storage ccs technologies or biomass blending the result is lifecycle greenhouse gas footprints that are generally greater than those released in the extraction and refinement of liquid fuel production from crude oil if ccs technologies are employed reductions of 5–12 can be achieved in coal to liquid ctl plants and up to a 75 reduction is achievable when co-gasifying coal with commercially demonstrated levels of biomass  30 biomass by weight in coalbiomass-to-liquids plants 64 for future synthetic fuel projects carbon dioxide sequestration is proposed to avoid releasing co2 into the atmosphere sequestration adds to the cost of production refined coaledit refined coal is the product of a coal-upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite brown coals it is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coals characteristics before it is burned the goals of precombustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned depending on the situation precombustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers industrial processes edit finely ground bituminous coal known in this application as sea coal is a constituent of foundry sand while the molten metal is in the mould the coal burns slowly releasing reducing gases at pressure and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand it is also contained in mould wash a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting 65 sea coal can be mixed with the clay lining the bod used for the bottom of a cupola furnace when heated the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable easing the process of breaking open holes for tapping the molten metal 66 production of chemicalsedit coal is an important feedstock in production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products 67 the main route to these products is coal gasification to produce syngas primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include methanol hydrogen and carbon monoxide which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured including olefins acetic acid formaldehyde ammonia urea and others the versatility of syngas as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using relatively inexpensive coal to produce a wide range of valuable commodities historically production of chemicals from coal has been used since the 1950s and has become established in the market according to the 2010 worldwide gasification database 68 a survey of current and planned gasifiers from 2004 to 2007 chemical production increased its gasification product share from 37 to 45 from 2008 to 2010 22 of new gasifier additions were to be for chemical production because the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from natural gas and petroleum the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective therefore interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production also production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like south africa china india and the united states where there are abundant coal resources the abundance of coal combined with lack of natural gas resources in china is strong inducement for the coal to chemicals industry pursued there in the united states the best example of the industry is eastman chemical company which has been successfully operating a coal-to-chemicals plant at its kingsport tennessee site since 1983 similarly sasol has built and operated coal-to-chemicals facilities in south africa coal to chemical processes do require substantial quantities of water as of 2013 much of the coal to chemical production was in the peoples republic of china 69 70 where environmental regulation and water management 71 was weak 72 coal industryedit coal as a traded commodityedit in north america central appalachian coal futures contracts are currently traded on the new york mercantile exchange trading symbol ql the trading unit is 1,550 short tons  1,410t per contract and is quoted in us dollars and cents per ton since coal is the principal fuel for generating electricity in the united states coal futures contracts provide coal producers and the electric power industry an important tool for hedging and risk management 73 in addition to the nymex contract the intercontinental exchange ice has european rotterdam and south african richards bay coal futures available for trading the trading unit for these contracts is 5,000 tonnes  5,500 short tons and are also quoted in us dollars and cents per ton 74 the price of coal increased from around $30.00 per short ton in 2000 to around $150.00 per short ton as of september 2008 as of october 2008 the price per short ton had declined to $111.50 prices further declined to $71.25 as of october 2010 75 in early 2015 it was trading near $56ton 76 environmental and health effectsedit health effectsedit the use of coal as fuel causes adverse health impacts and deaths 77 the deadly london smog was caused primarily by the heavy use of coal in the united states coal-fired power plants were estimated in 2004 to cause nearly 24,000 premature deaths every year including 2,800 from lung cancer 78 annual health costs in europe from use of coal to generate electricity are €42.8 billion or $55 billion 79 yet the disease and mortality burden of coal use today falls most heavily upon china 80 81 82 breathing in coal dust causes coalworkers pneumoconiosis which is known colloquially as black lung so-called because the coal dust literally turns the lungs black from their usual pink color 83 in the united states alone it is estimated that 1500 former employees of the coal industry die every year from the effects of breathing in coal mine dust 84 around 10 of coal is ash 85 coal ash is hazardous and toxic to human beings and other living things 86 coal ash contains the radioactive elements uranium and thorium coal ash and other solid combustion byproducts are stored locally and escape in various ways that expose those living near coal plants to radiation and environmental toxics 87 huge amounts of coal ash and other waste is produced annually in 2013 the us alone consumed on the order of 983 million short tonnes of coal per year 88 use of coal on this scale generates hundreds of millions of tons of ash and other waste products every year these include fly ash bottom ash and flue-gas desulfurization sludge that contain mercury uranium thorium arsenic and other heavy metals along with non-metals such as selenium 89 the american lung association the american nurses association and the physicians for social responsibility released a report in 2009 which details in depth the detrimental impact of the coal industry on human health including workers in the mines and individuals living in communities near plants burning coal as a power source this report provides medical information regarding damage to the lungs heart and nervous system of americans caused by the burning of coal as fuel it details how the air pollution caused by the plume of coal smokestack emissions is a cause of asthma strokes reduced intelligence artery blockages heart attacks congestive heart failure cardiac arrhythmias mercury poisoning arterial occlusion and lung cancer 2 more recently the chicago school of public health released a largely similar report echoing many of the same findings 90 though coal burning has increasingly been supplanted by less-toxic natural gas use in recent years a 2010 study by the clean air task force still estimated that air pollution from coal-fired power plants accounts for more than 13,000 premature deaths 20,000 heart attacks and 1.6 million lost workdays in the us each year the total monetary cost of these health impacts is over $100 billion annually 91 the who classifies coal as a dirty fuel and encourages the movement away from such fuels towards cleaner alternatives environmental effectsedit coal mining and coal fueling of power station and industrial processes can cause major environmental damage 92 water systems are affected by coal mining 93 for example mining affects groundwater and water table levels and acidity spills of fly ash such as the kingston fossil plant coal fly ash slurry spill can also contaminate land and waterways and destroy homes power stations that burn coal also consume large quantities of water this can affect the flows of rivers and has consequential impacts on other land uses one of the earliest known impacts of coal on the water cycle was acid rain approximately 75 tgs per year of sulfur dioxide so2 is released from burning coal after release the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous h2so2 which scatters solar radiation hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate this beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases however the sulphur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks 94 whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years release of so2 also contributes to the widespread acidification of ecosystems 95 disused coal mines can also cause issues subsidence can occur above tunnels causing damage to infrastructure or cropland coal mining can also cause long lasting fires and it has been estimated that thousands of coal seam fires are burning at any given time 96 for example there is a coal seam fire in germany that has been burning since 1668 and is still burning in the 21st century 97 some environmental impacts are modest such as dust nuisance however perhaps the largest and most long term effect of coal use is the release of carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas that causes climate change and global warming according to the ipcc and the epa coal is the largest contributor to the human-made increase of co2 in the atmosphere 98 the production of coke from coal produces ammonia coal tar and gaseous compounds as by-products which if discharged to land air or waterways can act as environmental pollutants 99 the whyalla steelworks is one example of a coke producing facility where liquid ammonia is discharged to the marine environment in 1999 world gross carbon dioxide emissions from coal usage were 8,666 million tonnes of carbon dioxide 100 in 2011 world gross emissions from coal usage were 14,416 million tonnes 101 for every megawatt-hour generated coal-fired electric power generation emits around 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide which is almost double the approximately 1100 pounds of carbon dioxide released by a natural gas-fired electric plant 102 because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation as the market in the united states has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation carbon dioxide emissions may have fallen 103 those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992 104 in 2013 the head of the un climate agency advised that most of the worlds coal reserves should be left in the ground to avoid catastrophic global warming 105 clean coal technologyedit clean coal technology is a collection of technologies being developed to mitigate the environmental impact of coal energy generation 106 those technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing minerals and impurities from the coal gasification see also igcc improved technology for treating flue gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency carbon capture and storage technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the flue gas and dewatering lower rank coals brown coals to improve the calorific value and thus the efficiency of the conversion into electricity figures from the united states environmental protection agency show that these technologies have made todays coal-based generating fleet 77 percent cleaner on the basis of regulated emissions per unit of energy produced 107 clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal historically the primary focus was on so2 and nox the most important gases in causation of acid rain and particulates which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health more recent focus has been on carbon dioxide due to its impact on global warming 108 and concern over toxic species such as mercury 109 concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery 110 potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage 111 and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter 112 113 several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by the clean coal concept pre-combustion capture  this involves gasification of a feedstock such as coal to form synthesis gas which may be shifted to produce a h2 and co2-rich gas mixture from which the co2 can be efficiently captured and separated transported and ultimately sequestered 114 this technology is usually associated with integrated gasification combined cycle process configurations 115 post-combustion capture  this refers to capture of co2 from exhaust gases of combustion processes typically using sorbents solvents or membrane separations to remove co2 from the bulk gases 116 oxy-fuel combustion  fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen rather than in air which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient low-cost co2 capture 117 the kemper county igcc project a 582 mw coal gasification-based power plant will use pre-combustion capture of co2 to capture 65 of the co2 the plant produces which will be utilizedgeologically sequestered in enhanced oil recovery operations 118 the saskatchewan governments boundary dam integrated carbon capture and sequestration demonstration project will use post-combustion amine-based scrubber technology to capture 90 of the co2 emitted by unit 3 of the power plant this co2 will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the weyburn oil fields 119 an early example of a coal-based plant using oxy-fuel carbon-capture technology is swedish company vattenfalls schwarze pumpe power station located in spremberg germany built by german firm siemens which went on-line in september 2008 120 121 the facility captures co2 and acid rain producing pollutants separates them and compresses the co2 into a liquid plans are to inject the co2 into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for co2 reduction in the atmosphere but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical 121 bioremediationedit the white rot fungus trametes versicolor can grow on and metabolize naturally occurring coal 122 the bacteria diplococcus has been found to degrade coal raising its temperature 123 economic aspectsedit coal by liquefaction technology is one of the backstop resources that could limit escalation of oil prices and mitigate the effects of transportation energy shortage that will occur under peak oil this is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic us production of fuel from coal becomes cost-competitive with oil priced at around $35 per barrel 124 with the $35 being the break-even cost with oil prices as low as around $40 per barrel in the us as of december 2008 liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the us but will probably be re-vitalized similar to oil sand projects with an oil price around $70 per barrel in china due to an increasing need for liquid energy in the transportation sector coal liquefaction projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below $40 per barrel 125 this is probably because china prefers not to be dependent on foreign oil instead utilizing its enormous domestic coal reserves as oil prices were increasing during the first half of 2009 the coal liquefaction projects in china were again boosted and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of $40 126 china is the largest producer of coal in the world it is the worlds largest energy consumer and relies on coal to supply 69 of its energy needs 127 an estimated 5 million people worked in chinas coal-mining industry in 2007 128 coal pollution costs the eu €43 billion each year 129 measures to cut air pollution may have beneficial long-term economic impacts for individuals 130 energy density and carbon impactedit the energy density of coal ie its heating value is roughly 24 megajoules per kilogram 131 approximately 6.7 kilowatt-hours per kg for a coal power plant with a 40 efficiency it takes an estimated 325kg  717lb of coal to power a 100w lightbulb for one year 132 as of 2006 the average efficiency of electricity-generating power stations was 31 in 2002 coal represented about 23 of total global energy supply an equivalent of 3.4 billion tonnes of coal of which 2.8 billion tonnes were used for electricity generation 133 the us energy information agencys 1999 report on co2 emissions for energy generation quotes an emission factor of 0.963kg co2kwh for coal power compared to 0.881kg co2kwh oil or 0.569kg co2kwh natural gas 134 underground firesedit thousands of coal fires are burning around the world 135 those burning underground can be difficult to locate and many cannot be extinguished fires can cause the ground above to subside their combustion gases are dangerous to life and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface wildfires coal seams can be set on fire by spontaneous combustion or contact with a mine fire or surface fire lightning strikes are an important source of ignition the coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen air can no longer reach the flame front a grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire 136 137 coal fires in china burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year emitting 360 million metric tons of co2 amounting to 2–3 of the annual worldwide production of co2 from fossil fuels 138 139 in centralia pennsylvania a borough located in the coal region of the united states an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill located in an abandoned anthracite strip mine pit attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful and it continues to burn underground to this day the australian burning mountain was originally believed to be a volcano but the smoke and ash come from a coal fire that has been burning for some 6,000 years 140 at kuh i malik in yagnob valley tajikistan coal deposits have been burning for thousands of years creating vast underground labyrinths full of unique minerals some of them very beautiful local people once used this methodclarification needed to mine ammoniac this place has been well-known since the time of herodotus but european geographers misinterpreted the ancient greek descriptions as the evidence of active volcanism in turkestan up to the 19th century when the russian army invaded the areacitation needed the reddish siltstone rock that caps many ridges and buttes in the powder river basin in wyoming and in western north dakota is called porcelanite which resembles the coal burning waste clinker or volcanic scoria 141 clinker is rock that has been fused by the natural burning of coal in the powder river basin approximately 27 to 54 billion tons of coal burned within the past three million years 142 wild coal fires in the area were reported by the lewis and clark expedition as well as explorers and settlers in the area 143 production trendsedit in 2006 china was the top producer of coal with 38 share followed by the united states and india according to the british geological survey as of 2012 coal production in the united states was falling at the rate of 7 annually 144 with many power plants using coal shut down or converted to natural gas however some of the reduced domestic demand was taken up by increased exports 145 with five coal export terminals being proposed in the pacific northwest to export coal from the powder river basin to china and other asian markets 146 however as of 2013 environmental opposition was increasing 147 high-sulfur coal mined in illinois which was unsaleable in the united states found a ready market in asia as exports reached 13 million tons in 2012 148 world coal reservesedit the 948 billion short tons of recoverable coal reserves estimated by the energy information administration are equal to about 4,196 bboe billion barrels of oil equivalent 38 the amount of coal burned during 2007 was estimated at 7.075 billion short tons or 133.179 quadrillion btus 149 this is an average of 18.8 million btu per short ton in terms of heat content this is about 57,000,000 barrels  9,100,000m3 of oil equivalent per day by comparison in 2007 natural gas provided 51,000,000 barrels  8,100,000m3 of oil equivalent per day while oil provided 85,800,000 barrels  13,640,000m3 per day british petroleum in its 2007 report estimated at 2006 end that there were 147 years reserves-to-production ratio based on proven coal reserves worldwide this figure only includes reserves classified as proven exploration drilling programs by mining companies particularly in under-explored areas are continually providing new reserves in many cases companies are aware of coal deposits that have not been sufficiently drilled to qualify as proven however some nations havent updated their information and assume reserves remain at the same levels even with withdrawals of the three fossil fuels coal has the most widely distributed reserves coal is mined in over 100 countries and on all continents except antarctica the largest reserves are found in the united states russia china australia and india note the table below major coal producersedit the reserve life is

link to coal mining some cultures hold that children who misbehave will receive only a lump of coal from santa claus for christmas in their christmas stockings instead of presents it is also customary and considered lucky in scotland and the north of england to give coal as a gift on new years day this occurs as part of first-footing and represents warmth for the year to come see alsoedit energy
