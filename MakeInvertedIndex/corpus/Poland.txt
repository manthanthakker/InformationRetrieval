the sixth most populous member of the european union as well as the most populous post-communist member of the european union poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions and its capital and largest city is warsaw other metropolises include kraków wrocław poznań gdańsk and szczecin the countrys largest urban agglomeration is the silesian metropolis the establishment of a polish state can be traced back to 966 when mieszko i 12 ruler of a territory roughly coextensive with that of present-day poland converted to christianity the kingdom of poland was founded in 1025 and in 1569 it cemented a longstanding political association with the grand duchy of lithuania by signing the union of lublin this union formed the polishlithuanian commonwealth one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century europe 13 14 the commonwealth ceased to exist in the years 1772–95 when its territory was partitioned among prussia the russian empire and austria poland regained its independence as the second polish republic at the end of world war i in 1918 in september 1939 world war ii started with the invasions of poland by nazi germany and the soviet union as part of the molotovribbentrop pact more than six million polish citizens died in the war 15 16 the borders of poland were shifted westwards according to the potsdam conference in the aftermath of world war ii after the war with the backing of the soviet union a communist puppet government was formed and after a falsified referendum in 1946 it took control of the countryturning poland into a satellite state 17 of the soviet union as the peoples republic of poland during the revolutions of 1989 polands communist government was overthrown and poland adopted a new constitution establishing itself as a democracy despite the large number of casualties and destruction the country experienced during world war ii the country managed to preserve much of its cultural wealth there are 14 heritage sites inscribed on the unesco world heritage 18 and 54 historical monuments and many objects of cultural heritage in poland since the beginning of the transition to a primarily market-based economy that took place in the early 1990s poland has achieved a very high ranking on the human development index 19 as well as gradually improving economic freedom 20 poland is a

inhabited the warta river basin of the historic greater poland region in the 8th century the origin of the name polanie itself derives from the western slavic word pole field in some foreign languages such as hungarian lithuanian persian and turkish the exonym for poland is lechites lechici which derives from the name of a semi-legendray ruler of polans lech i history prehistory and protohistory historians have postulated that throughout late antiquity many distinct ethnic groups populated the regions of what is now poland the ethnicity and linguistic affiliation of these groups have been hotly debated the time and route of the original settlement of slavic peoples in these regions lacks written records and can only be defined as fragmented 27 the most famous archaeological find from the prehistory and protohistory of poland is the biskupin fortified settlement now reconstructed as an open-air museum dating from the lusatian culture of the early iron age around 700 bc the slavic groups who would form poland migrated to these areas in the second half of the 5th century ad up until the creation of mieszkos state and his subsequent conversion to christianity in 966 ad the main religion of slavic tribes that inhabited the geographical area of present-day poland was slavic paganism with the baptism of poland the polish rulers accepted christianity and the religious authority of the roman church however the transition from paganism was not a smooth and instantaneous process for the rest of the population as evident from the pagan reaction of the 1030s 28 piast dynasty poland began to form into a recognizable unitary and territorial entity around the middle of the 10th century under the piast dynasty polands first historically documented ruler mieszko i accepted christianity with the baptism of poland in 966 as the new official religion of his subjects the bulk of the population converted in the course of the next few centuries in 1000 boleslaw the brave continuing the policy of his father mieszko held a congress of gniezno and created the metropolis of gniezno and the dioceses of kraków kołobrzeg and wrocław however the pagan unrest led to the transfer of the capital to kraków in 1038 by casimir i the restorer 29 in 1109 prince bolesław iii wrymouth defeated the king of germany henry v at the battle of hundsfeld stopping the german march into poland the significance of the event was documented by gallus anonymus in his 1118 chronicle 30 in 1138 poland fragmented into several smaller duchies when bolesław divided his lands among his sons in 1226 konrad i of masovia one of the regional piast dukes invited the teutonic knights to help him fight the baltic prussian pagans a decision which led to centuries of warfare with the knights in 1264 the statute of kalisz or the general charter of jewish liberties introduced numerous right for the jews in poland leading to a nearly autonomous nation within a nation 31 in the middle of the 13th century the silesian branch of the piast dynasty henry i the bearded and henry ii the pious ruled 1238–41 nearly succeeded in uniting the polish lands but the mongols invaded the country from the east and defeated the combined polish forces at the battle of legnica where duke henry ii the pious died in 1320 after a number of earlier unsuccessful attempts by regional rulers at uniting the polish dukedoms władysław i consolidated his power took the throne and became the first king of a reunified poland his son casimir iii reigned 1333–70 has a reputation as one of the greatest polish kings and gained wide recognition for improving the countrys infrastructure 32 33 he also extended royal protection to jews and encouraged their immigration to poland 32 34 casimir iii realized that the nation needed a class of educated people especially lawyers who could codify the countrys laws and administer the courts and offices his efforts to create an institution of higher learning in poland were finally rewarded when pope urban v granted him permission to open the university of kraków the golden liberty of the nobles began to develop under casimirs rule when in return for their military support the king made a series of concessions to the nobility and establishing their legal status as superior to that of the townsmen when casimir the great died in 1370 leaving no legitimate male heir the piast dynasty came to an end during the 12th and 13th centuries poland became a destination for german flemish and to a lesser extent scottish danish and walloon migrants also the jews and armenians began to settle and flourish in poland during this era see history of the jews in poland and armenians in poland the black death a plague that ravaged europe from 1347 to 1351 did not significantly affect poland and the country was spared from a major outbreak of the disease 35 36 the reason for this was the decision of casimir the great to quarantine the nations borders jagiellon dynasty the jagiellon dynasty spanned the late middle ages and early modern era of polish history beginning with the lithuanian grand duke jogaila władysław ii jagiełło the jagiellon dynasty  1386–1572 formed the polishlithuanian union the partnership brought vast lithuania-controlled rus areas into polands sphere of influence and proved beneficial for the poles and lithuanians who coexisted and cooperated in one of the largest political entities in europe for the next four centuries in the baltic sea region polands struggle with the teutonic knights continued and culminated in the battle of grunwald  1410 where a combined polish-lithuanian army inflicted a decisive victory against the teutonic knights allowing for territorial expansion of both nations into the far north region of livonia 37 in 1466 after the thirteen years war king casimir iv jagiellon gave royal consent to the peace of thorn which created the future duchy of prussia a polish vassal the jagiellon dynasty at one point also established dynastic control over the kingdoms of bohemia  1471 onwards and hungary 38 39 in the south poland confronted the ottoman empire and the crimean tatars by whom they were attacked on 75 separate occasions between 1474 and 1569 40 and in the east helped lithuania fight the grand duchy of moscow some historians estimate that crimean tatar slave-raiding cost poland-lithuania one million of its population between the years of 1494 and 1694 41 poland was developing as a feudal state with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly powerful landed nobility the nihil novi act adopted by the polish sejm parliament in 1505 transferred most of the legislative power from the monarch to the sejm an event which marked the beginning of the period known as golden liberty when the state was ruled by the free and equal polish nobility protestant reformation movements made deep inroads into polish christianity which resulted in the establishment of policies promoting religious tolerance unique in europe at that time 42 this tolerance allowed the country to avoid most the religious turmoil that spread over europe during the 16th century 42 the european renaissance evoked in late jagiellon poland kings sigismund i the old and sigismund ii augustus a sense of urgency in the need to promote a cultural awakening and during this period polish culture and the nations economy flourished in 1543 nicolaus copernicus a polish astronomer from toruń published his epochal work de revolutionibus orbium coelestium on the revolutions of the celestial spheres and thus became the first proponent of a predictive mathematical model confirming the heliocentric theory which became the accepted basic model for the practice of modern astronomy another major figure associated with the era is the classicist poet jan kochanowski 43 polishlithuanian commonwealth the 1569 union of lublin established the polishlithuanian commonwealth a more closely unified federal state with an elective monarchy but which was governed largely by the nobility through a system of local assemblies with a central parliament the warsaw confederation  1573 confirmed the religious freedom of all residents of poland which was extremely important for the stability of the multiethnic polish society of the time 31 serfdom was banned in 1588 44 the establishment of the commonwealth coincided with a period of stability and prosperity in poland with the union thereafter becoming a european power and a major cultural entity occupying approximately one million square kilometers of central and eastern europe as well as an agent for the dissemination of western culture through polonization into areas of modern-day lithuania ukraine belarus and western russia in the 16th and 17th centuries poland suffered from a number of dynastic crises during the reigns of the vasa kings sigismund iii and władysław iv and found itself engaged in major conflicts with russia sweden and the ottoman empire as well as a series of minor cossack uprisings 45 in 1610 hetman stanisław żółkiewski seized moscow after winning the battle of klushino from the middle of the 17th century the nobles democracy suffering from internal disorder gradually declined thus leaving the once powerful commonwealth vulnerable to foreign intervention starting in 1648 the cossack khmelnytsky uprising engulfed the south and east eventually leaving ukraine divided with the eastern part lost by the commonwealth becoming a dependency of the tsardom of russia this was followed by the deluge a swedish invasion of poland which marched through the polish heartlands and ruined the countrys population culture and infrastructure around four million of polands eleven million inhabitants died in famines and epidemics 46 however under john iii sobieski the commonwealths military prowess was re-established and in 1683 polish forces played a major role in the battle of vienna against the ottoman army commanded by kara mustafa the grand vizier of the ottoman empire sobieskis reign marked the end of the nations golden-era finding itself subjected to almost constant warfare and suffering enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy the commonwealth fell into decline the government became ineffective as a result of large-scale internal conflicts eg lubomirski rebellion against john ii casimir and rebellious confederations and corrupted legislative processes the nobility fell under the control of a handful of magnats and this compounded with two relatively weak kings of the saxon wettin dynasty augustus ii and augustus iii as well as the rise of russia and prussia after the great northern war only served to worsen the commonwealths plight despite this the commonwealth-saxony personal union gave rise to the emergence of the commonwealths first reform movement and laid the foundations for the polish enlightenment 47 during the later part of the 18th century the commonwealth made attempts to implement fundamental internal reforms with the second half of the century bringing a much improved economy significant population growth and far-reaching progress in the areas of education intellectual life art and especially toward the end of the period evolution of the social and political system the most populous capital city of warsaw replaced gdańsk danzig as the leading centre of commerce and the role of the more prosperous townsmen increased age of partitions the royal election of 1764 resulted in the elevation of stanisław ii august a polish aristocrat connected to major magnate factions to the monarchy however a one-time lover of empress catherine ii of russia the new king spent much of his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save his nation and his perceived necessity to remain in a political relationship with his russian sponsor this led to the formation of the 1768 bar confederation a szlachta rebellion directed against russia and the polish king that fought to preserve polands independence and the szlachtas traditional privileges attempts at reform provoked the unions neighbours and in 1772 the first partition of the commonwealth by prussia russia and austria took place an act which the partition sejm under considerable duress eventually ratified fait accompli 48 disregarding this loss in 1773 the king established the commission of national education the first government education authority in europe corporal punishment of children was officially prohibited in 1783 the great sejm convened by stanisław ii august in 1788 successfully adopted the 3 may constitution the first set of modern supreme national laws in europe however this document accused by detractors of harbouring revolutionary sympathies generated strong opposition from the commonwealths nobles and conservatives as well as from catherine ii who determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong commonwealth set about planning the final dismemberment of the polish-lithuanian state russia was aided in achieving its goal when the targowica confederation an organisation of polish nobles appealed to the empress for help in may 1792 russian forces crossed the commonwealths frontier thus beginning the polish-russian war the defensive war fought by the poles ended prematurely when the king convinced of the futility of resistance capitulated and joined the targowica confederation the confederation then took over the government russia and prussia fearing the mere existence of a polish state arranged for and in 1793 executed the second partition of the commonwealth which left the country deprived of so much territory that it was practically incapable of independent existence eventually in 1795 following the failed kościuszko uprising the commonwealth was partitioned one last time by all three of its more powerful neighbours and with this effectively ceased to exist 49 era of insurrections poles rebelled several times against the partitioners particularly near the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century an unsuccessful attempt at defending polands sovereignty took place in 1794 during the kościuszko uprising where a popular and distinguished general tadeusz kosciuszko who had several years earlier served under washington in the american revolutionary war led polish insurrectionists against numerically superior russian forces despite the victory at the battle of racławice his ultimate defeat ended polands independent existence for 123 years 50 in 1807 napoleon i of france temporarily recreated a polish state as the satellite duchy of warsaw after a successful greater poland uprising of 1806 against prussian rule but after the failed napoleonic wars poland was again split between the victorious powers at the congress of vienna of 1815 51 the eastern part was ruled by the russian tsar as congress poland which had a very liberal constitution however over time the russian tsar reduced polish freedoms and russia annexed the country in virtually all but name meanwhile the prussian controlled territory of poland came under increased germanization thus in the 19th century only austrian ruled galicia and particularly the free city of kraków allowed free polish culture to flourish throughout the period of the partitions political and cultural repression of the polish nation led to the organisation of a number of uprisings against the authorities of the occupying russian prussian and austrian governments in 1830 the november uprising began in warsaw when led by lieutenant piotr wysocki young non-commissioned officers at the officer cadet school in warsaw revolted they were joined by large segments of polish society and together forced warsaws russian garrison to withdraw north of the city over the course of the next seven months polish forces successfully defeated the russian armies of field marshal hans karl von diebitsch and a number of other russian commanders however finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers save distant france and the newborn united states and with prussia and austria refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories the poles accepted that the uprising was doomed to failure upon the surrender of warsaw to general ivan paskievich many polish troops feeling they could not go on withdrew into prussia and there laid down their arms after the defeat the semi-independent congress poland lost its constitution army and legislative assembly and was integrated more closely with the russian empire during the spring of nations a series of revolutions which swept across europe poles took up arms in the greater poland uprising of 1848 to resist prussian rule initially the uprising manifested itself in the form of civil disobedience but eventually turned into an armed struggle when the prussian military was sent in to pacify the region eventually after several battles the uprising was suppressed by the prussians and the grand duchy of posen was stripped of its autonomy and completely incorporated into the german confederation in 1863 a new polish uprising against russian rule began the january uprising started out as a spontaneous protest by young poles against conscription into the imperial russian army however the insurrectionists despite being joined by high-ranking polish-lithuanian officers and numerous politicians were still severely outnumbered and lacking in foreign support they were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare tactics and failed to win any major military victories afterwards no major uprising was witnessed in the russian-controlled congress poland and poles resorted instead to fostering economic and cultural self-improvement despite the political unrest experienced during the partitions poland did benefit from large-scale industrialisation and modernisation programs instituted by the occupying powers which helped it develop into a more economically coherent and viable entity this was particularly true in greater poland silesia and eastern pomerania controlled by prussia later becoming a part of the german empire areas which eventually thanks largely to the greater poland uprising of 1918 and silesian uprisings were reconstituted as a part of the second polish republic becoming the countrys most prosperous regions reconstruction during world war i all the allies agreed on the reconstitution of poland that united states president woodrow wilson proclaimed in point 13 of his fourteen points a total of 2 million polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers and 450,000 died shortly after the armistice with germany in november 1918 poland regained its independence as the second polish republic ii rzeczpospolita polska it reaffirmed its independence after a series of military conflicts the most notable being the polishsoviet war  1919–21 when poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the red army at the battle of warsaw an event which is considered to have halted the advance of communism into europe and forced vladimir lenin to rethink his objective of achieving global socialism the event is often referred to as the miracle at the vistula 52 during this period poland successfully managed to fuse the territories of the three former partitioning powers into a cohesive nation state railways were restructured to direct traffic towards warsaw instead of the former imperial capitals a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a major seaport was opened on the baltic coast so as to allow polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged free city of danzig the inter-war period heralded in a new era of polish politics whilst polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the first world war the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition for this reason many exiled polish activists such as ignacy paderewski who would later become prime minister returned home to help a significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures tragedy struck in 1922 when gabriel narutowicz inaugural holder of the presidency was assassinated at the zachęta gallery in warsaw by painter and right-wing nationalist eligiusz niewiadomski 53 the 1926 may coup of józef piłsudski turned rule of the second polish republic over to the sanacja movement by the 1930s poland had become increasingly authoritarian a number of undesirable political parties such as the polish communists had been banned and following piłsudskis death the regime unable to appoint a new leader began to show its inherent internal weaknesses and unwillingness to cooperate in any way with other political parties as result of the munich agreement in 1938 major european powers germany france britain and italy awarded poland the small 350 sq mi zaolzie region of czechoslovakia the area was a point of contention between the polish and czechoslovak governments in the past and the two countries fought a brief seven-day war over it in 1919 world war ii the formal beginning of world war ii was marked by the nazi german invasion of poland on 1 september 1939 followed by the soviet invasion of poland on 17 september in violation of the sovietpolish non-aggression pact on 28 september 1939 warsaw capitulated as agreed earlier in the molotovribbentrop pact poland was split into two occupied zones one subdivided by nazi germany while the other including all of eastern kresy fell under the control of the soviet union in 1939–41 the soviets had deported hundreds of thousands of poles out to the most distant parts of the soviet union the soviet nkvd secretly executed thousands of polish prisoners of war inter alia katyn massacre ahead of the operation barbarossa 54 german planners had in november 1939 called for the complete destruction of all poles and their fate as well as many other slavs was outlined in genocidal generalplan ost 55 during the war poland made the fourth-largest troop contribution to the allied war effort after the soviets the british and the americansb polish troops fought under the command of both the polish government in exile in the west and under soviet leadership in the east the polish expeditionary corps which was controlled by the exiled pre-war government based in london played an important role in the italian and north african campaigns 56 57 they are particularly well remembered for their conduct at the battle of monte cassino a conflict which culminated in the raising of a polish flag over the ruins of the mountain-top abbey by the 12th podolian uhlans the polish forces in the west were commanded by lieutenant general władysław anders who had received his command from prime minister of the exiled government władysław sikorski in the east the soviet-backed polish 1st army distinguished itself in the battles for warsaw and berlin 58 polish servicemen were also active in the theatres of naval and air warfare during the battle of britain polish squadrons such as the no 303 kościuszko fighter squadron 59 achieved considerable success and by the end of the war the exiled polish air forces could claim 769 confirmed kills meanwhile the polish navy was active in the protection of convoys in the north sea and atlantic ocean 60 in addition to the organised units of the 1st army and the forces in the nazi-occupied europe the domestic underground resistance movement the armia krajowa home army fought against the german occupation the wartime resistance movement in poland was one of the three largest resistance movements of the entire warc and encompassed an unusually broad range of clandestine activities which essentially functioned as an underground state complete with degree-awarding universities and a court system 61 the resistance was however largely loyal to the exiled government and generally resented the idea of a communist poland for this reason in the summer of 1944 they initiated operation tempest of which the warsaw uprising that begun on 1 august 1944 was the best known operation 62 63 the objective of the uprising was to drive the german occupiers from the city and help with the larger fight against germany and the axis powers however secondary motives for the uprising sought to see warsaw liberated before the soviets could reach the capital so as to underscore polish sovereignty by empowering the polish underground state before the soviet-backed polish committee of national liberation could assume control however a lack of available allied military aid and stalins reluctance to allow the 1st army to help their fellow countrymen take the city led to the uprisings failure and subsequent planned destruction of the city during the war german forces under direct order from adolf hitler set up six major extermination camps all of which operated in the heart of poland they included the notorious treblinka majdanek and auschwitz killing centers this allowed the germans to transport the condemned jews under the guise of resettlement from the third reich and across occupied europe and systematically murder them in the death camps set up in the polish areas annexed by nazi germany the nazi crimes against the polish nation claimed the lives of 2.9 million polish jews 64 and 2.8 million ethnic poles 65 including polish academics doctors lawyers nobility priests and numerous others since 3,5 million jews lived in pre-war poland jewish victims make up the largest percentage of all victims of the nazis extermination program it is estimated that of pre-war polands jewry approximately 90 were killed throughout the occupation many members of the armia krajowa supported by the polish government in exile and millions of ordinary poles  at great risk to themselves and their families  engaged in rescuing jews from the nazi germans grouped by nationality poles represent the largest number of people who rescued jews during the holocaust to date 6,620 poles have been awarded the title of righteous among the nations by the state of israelmore than any other nation 66 some estimates put the number of poles involved in rescue efforts at up to 3 million and credit poles with sheltering up to 450,000 jews also some 150,000 polish civilians were killed by soviet communists between 1939 and 1941 during the soviet unions occupation of eastern poland kresy and another estimated 100,000 poles were killed by the ukrainian insurgent army upa in the regions of wołyń and eastern galicia between 1943 and 1944 in what became known as the wołyń massacres the massacres were part of a vicious ethnic clensing campaign waged by ukrainian nationalists against the local polish population in the german-occupied territories of eastern poland 67 68 at the wars conclusion in 1945 polands borders were shifted westwards resulting in considerable territorial losses most of the polish inhabitants of kresy were expelled along the curzon line in accordance with stalins agreements 69 the western border was moved to the oder-neisse line as a result polands territory was reduced by 20 or 77,500 square kilometres  29,900sqmi the shift forced the migration of millions of other people most of whom were poles germans ukrainians and jews 70 of all the countries involved in the war poland lost the highest percentage of its citizens over 6 million perished  nearly one-fifth of polands population  half of them polish jews 15 16 71 72 over 90 of deaths were non-military in nature population numbers did not recover until the 1970s post-war communism at the insistence of joseph stalin the yalta conference sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-communist coalition government in moscow which ignored the polish government-in-exile based in london a move which angered many poles who considered it a betrayal by the allies in 1944 stalin had made guarantees to churchill and roosevelt that he would maintain polands sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place however upon achieving victory in 1945 the elections organized by the occupying soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for soviet hegemony over polish affairs the soviet union instituted a new communist government in poland analogous to much of the rest of the eastern bloc as elsewhere in communist europe the soviet occupation of poland met with armed resistance from the outset which continued into the fifties despite widespread objections the new polish government accepted the soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of poland 73 in particular the cities of wilno and lwów and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of red army units on polands territory military alignment within the warsaw pact throughout the cold war came about as a direct result of this change in polands political culture and in the european scene came to characterise the full-fledged integration of poland into the brotherhood of communist nations the peoples republic of poland polska rzeczpospolita ludowa was officially proclaimed in 1952 in 1956 after the death of bolesław bierut the régime of władysław gomułka became temporarily more liberal freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms collectivization in the polish peoples republic failed a similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under edward gierek but most of the time persecution of anti-communist opposition groups persisted despite this poland was at the time considered to be one of the least oppressive states of the soviet bloc 74 labour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity solidarność which over time became a political force despite persecution and imposition of martial law in 1981 it eroded the dominance of the polish united workers party and by 1989 had triumphed in polands first partially free and democratic parliamentary elections since the end of the second world war lech wałęsa a solidarity candidate eventually won the presidency in 1990 the solidarity movement heralded the collapse of communist regimes and parties across europe present-day a shock therapy programme initiated by leszek balcerowicz in the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its socialist-style planned economy into a market economy as with other post-communist countries poland suffered slumps in social and economic standards 75 but it became the first post-communist country to reach its pre-1989 gdp levels which it achieved by 1995 largely thanks to its booming economy 76 77 most visibly there were numerous improvements in human rights such as freedom of speech internet freedom no censorship civil liberties  1st class and political rights  1st class as ranked by freedom house non-governmental organization in 1991 poland became a member of the visegrád group and joined the north atlantic treaty organization nato alliance in 1999 along with the czech republic slovakia and hungary poles then voted to join the european union in a referendum in june 2003 with poland becoming a full member on 1 may 2004 poland joined the schengen area in 2007 as a result of which the countrys borders with other member states of the european union have been dismantled allowing for full freedom of movement within most of the eu 78 in contrast to this a section of polands eastern border now comprises the external eu border with belarus russia and ukraine that border has become increasingly well protected and has led in part to the coining of the phrase fortress europe in reference to the seeming impossibility of gaining entry to the eu for citizens of the former soviet union in an effort to strengthen military cooperation with its neighbors poland set up the visegrád battlegroup with hungary czech republic and slovakia with a total of 3,000 troops ready for deployment also in the east

seacoast which extends from the bay of pomerania to the gulf of gdańsk this coast is marked by several spits coastal lakes former bays that have been cut off from the sea and dunes the largely straight coastline is indented by the szczecin lagoon the bay of puck and the vistula lagoon the centre and parts of the north lie within the north european plain rising above these lowlands is a geographical region comprising the four hilly districts of moraines and moraine-dammed lakes formed during and after the pleistocene ice age these lake districts are the pomeranian lake district the greater polish lake district the kashubian lake district and the masurian lake district the masurian lake district is the largest of the four and covers much of north-eastern poland the lake districts form part of the baltic ridge a series of moraine belts along the southern shore of the baltic sea south of the northern european lowlands lie the regions of lusatia silesia and masovia which are marked by broad ice-age river valleys farther south lies the polish mountain region including the sudetes the kraków-częstochowa upland the świętokrzyskie mountains and the carpathian mountains including the beskids the highest part of the carpathians is the tatra mountains along polands southern border geology the geological structure of poland has been shaped by the continental collision of europe and africa over the past 60million years and more recently by the quaternary glaciations of northern europe both processes shaped the sudetes and the carpathian mountains the moraine landscape of northern poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or loam while the ice age river valleys of the south often contain loess the kraków-częstochowa upland the pieniny and the western tatras consist of limestone while the high tatras the beskids and the karkonosze are made up mainly of granite and basalts the polish jura chain is one of the oldest mountain ranges on earth poland has 70 mountains over 2,000 metres  6,600 feet in elevation all in the tatras the polish tatras which consist of the high tatras and the western tatras is the highest mountain group of poland and of

in the silesian voivodeship in southern poland it has a total area of 32 square kilometres  12sqmi it is one of only five natural deserts in europe but also it is the warmest desert that appears at this latitude the baltic sea activity in słowiński national park created sand dunes which in the course of time separated the bay from the sea creating two lakes as waves and wind carry sand inland the dunes slowly move at a rate of 3 to 10 metres  9.8 to 32.8ft meters per year some dunes reach the height of up to 30 metres  98ft the highest peak of the park is rowokol  115 metres or 377 feet

tributary the warta 808 kilometres  502mi long and the bug a tributary of the vistula 772 kilometres  480mi long the vistula and the oder flow into the baltic sea as do numerous smaller rivers in pomerania the łyna and the angrapa flow by way of the pregolya to the baltic and the czarna hańcza flows into the baltic through the neman while the great majority of polands rivers drain into the baltic sea polands beskids are the source of some of the upper tributaries of the orava which flows via the váh and the danube to the black sea the eastern beskids are also the source of some streams that drain through the dniester to the black sea polands rivers have been used since early times for navigation the vikings for example traveled up the vistula and the oder in their longships in the middle ages and in early modern times when the polishlithuanian commonwealth was the breadbasket of europe 81 the shipment of grain and other agricultural products down the vistula toward gdańsk and onward to other parts of europe took on great importance 81 in the valley of pilica river in tomaszów mazowiecki there is a unique natural karst spring of water containing calcium salts that is an object of protection in niebieskie źródła nature reserve in sulejów landscape park the origin of the name of the reserve niebieskie źródła that means blue springs comes from the fact that red waves are absorbed by water and only blue and green are reflected from the bottom of the spring giving that atypical colour 82 with almost ten thousand closed bodies of water covering more than 1 hectare  2.47 acres each poland has one of the highest numbers of lakes in the world in europe only finland has a greater density of lakes 83 the largest lakes covering more than 100 square kilometres  39sqmi

to todays modern polish society the ancestors of todays poles the polanie built their first fortresses on islands in these lakes the legendary prince popiel ruled from kruszwica tower erected on the lake gopło 84 the first historically documented ruler of poland duke mieszko i had his palace on an island in the warta river in poznań nowadays the polish lakes provide a location for the pursuit of water sports such as yachting and wind-surfing the polish baltic coast is approximately 528 kilometres  328mi long and extends from świnoujście on the islands of usedom and wolin in the west to krynica morska on the vistula spit in the east for the most part poland has a smooth coastline which has been shaped by the continual movement of sand by currents and winds this continual erosion and deposition has formed cliffs dunes and spits many of which have migrated landwards to close off former lagoons such as łebsko lake in słowiński national park prior to the end of the second world war and subsequent change in national borders poland had only a very small coastline this was situated at the end of the polish corridor the only internationally recognised polish territory which afforded the country access to the sea however after world war ii the redrawing of polands borders and resulting shift of the countrys borders left it with an expanded coastline thus allowing for far greater access to the sea than was ever previously possible the significance of this event and importance of it to polands future as a major industrialised nation was alluded to by the 1945 wedding to the sea the largest spits are hel peninsula and the vistula spit the largest polish baltic island is called wolin the largest sea harbours are szczecin świnoujście gdańsk gdynia police and kołobrzeg and the main coastal resorts - świnoujście międzyzdroje kołobrzeg łeba sopot władysławowo and the hel peninsula land use poland is the fourth most forested country in europe forests cover about 30.5 of

nature the territory of poland belongs to three palearctic ecoregions of the continental forest spanning central and northern european temperate broadleaf and mixed forest ecoregions as well as the carpathian montane conifer forest many animals that have since died out in other parts of europe still survive in poland such as the wisent in the ancient woodland of the białowieża forest and in podlaskie other such species include the brown bear in białowieża in the tatras and in the beskids the gray wolf and the eurasian lynx in various forests the moose in northern poland and the beaver in

describes it as the first of its kind in europe 96 the constitution was instituted as a government act polish ustawa rządowa and then adopted on 3 may 1791 by the sejm of the polishlithuanian commonwealth primarily it was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the federative polishlithuanian commonwealth and its golden liberty previously only the henrican articles signed by each of polands elected kings could perform the function of a set of basic laws the new constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and the nobility szlachta and placed the peasants under the protection of the government the constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto which at one time had placed the sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose or be bribed by an interest or foreign power to have rescinded all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm the 3 may constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the countrys reactionary magnates with a more egalitarian and democratic constitutional monarchy the adoption of the constitution was treated as a threat by polands neighbours 97 in response prussia austria and russia formed an anti-polish alliance and over the next decade collaborated with one another to partition their weaker neighbour and destroyed the polish state in the words of two of its co-authors ignacy potocki and hugo kołłątaj the constitution represented the last will and testament of the expiring fatherland despite this its text influenced many later democratic movements across the globe 98 in poland freedom of expression is guaranteed by the article 25 section i the republic and article 54 section ii the freedoms rights and obligations of persons

with ukraine 106 with whom it co-hosted the uefa euro 2012 football tournament in an effort to firmly anchor the country within the western world and provide it with an alternative to aligning itself with the russian federation despite many positive developments in the region poland has found itself in a position where it must seek to defend the rights of ethnic poles living in the former soviet union this is particularly true of belarus where in 2005 the lukashenko regime launched a campaign against the polish ethnic minority 107 poland is the sixth most populous member state of the european union and has a grand total of 51 representatives in the european parliament ever since joining the union in 2004 successive polish governments have pursued policies to increase the countrys role in

measurements and research also the polish navy played a more international role as part of the 2003 invasion of iraq providing logistical support for the united states navy the current position of the polish air force is much the same it has routinely taken part in baltic air policing assignments but otherwise with the exception of a number of units serving in afghanistan has seen no active combat since the end of the second world war in 2003 the f-16c block 52 was chosen as the new general multi-role fighter for the air force the first deliveries taking place in november 2006 the most important mission of the armed forces is the defence of polish territorial integrity and polish interests abroad 108 polands national security goal is to further integrate with nato and european defence economic and political institutions through the modernisation and reorganisation of its military 108 the armed forces are being re-organised according to nato standards and since 2010 the transition to an entirely contract-based military has been completed during the previous period men were obliged to undertake compulsory military service in the final stage of validity of this type of military service since 2007 until the amendment of the law on conscription in 2008 the duration of compulsory service amounted nine months 109 polish military doctrine reflects the same defensive nature as that of its nato partners from 1953 to 2009 poland was a large contributor to various united nations peacekeeping missions 108 110 the polish armed forces took part in the 2003 invasion of iraq deploying 2,500 soldiers in the south of that country and commanding the 17-nation multinational force in iraq the military was temporarily but severely affected by the loss of many of its top

order and a number of other specialised agencies such as the polish border guard acting to fulfil their assigned missions in addition to these state services private security companies are also common although they possess no powers assigned to state agencies such as for example the power to make an arrest or detain a suspect emergency services in poland consist of the emergency medical services

centrally planned to a primarily market-based economy the countrys most successful exports include machinery furniture food products clothing shoes and cosmetics 117 118 polands largest trading partner is germany 119 the privatization of small and medium state-owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new firms have allowed the development of the private sector also several consumer rights organizations have become active in the country restructuring and privatisation of sensitive sectors such as coal steel rail transport and energy has been continuing since 1990 the biggest privatisations have been the sale of the national telecoms firm telekomunikacja polska to france télécom in 2000 and an issue of 30 of the shares in polands largest bank pko bank polski on the polish

connected with its intricate 1,000-year history 196 its unique character developed as a result of its geography at the confluence of european cultures with origins in the culture of the proto-slavs over time polish culture has been profoundly influenced by its interweaving ties with the germanic latinate and byzantine worlds as well as in continual dialog with the many other ethnic groups and minorities living in poland 197 the people of poland have traditionally been seen as hospitable to artists from abroad and eager to follow cultural and artistic trends popular in other countries in the 19th and 20th centuries the polish focus on cultural advancement often took precedence over political and economic activity these factors have contributed to the versatile nature of polish art with all its complex nuances 197 famous people the list of famous poles begins in earnest with the polymath mikołaj kopernik nicolaus copernicus 198 who studied at the jagiellonian university founded in 1364 by casimir the great from proceeds of his wieliczka salt mine 199 poland is the birthplace of many distinguished personalities among whom are fryderyk chopin 200 201 maria skłodowska curie 202

poland has maintained a high level of gender equality an established disability rights movement and promotes peaceful equality 204 poland was the first country in the world to prohibit corporal punishment in all its forms poland has throughout most of its long history experienced only very limited immigration from abroad this trend can be largely attributed to polands rejection of slavery and to a lack of overseas colonies as well as occupation of its territories during much of the 19th and early 20th centuries despite this the country has for a long time been regarded as having a very tolerant society which affords equal rights to all people no matter what their ethnic background 204 this can be said to stem largely from the reign of king casimir iii the great and his acceptance of polands jewish community in a time when most of europe recessed into antisemitic moods and actions the history of jews in poland exemplifies peaceful co-existence of a nation with a particular ethnic group 204 today as many as 96.7 of polish citizens declare to be poles and 97.8 declare that they speak polish at home census 2002 the population of poland became one of the most ethnically homogeneous in the world as a result of the radically altered borders after world war ii and the subsequent migrations this homogeneity is a result of post world war ii deportations ordered by the

traditional regionalized folk musicians create a lively and diverse music scene which even recognizes its own music genres such as poezja śpiewana and disco polo as of 2006update poland is one of the few countries in europe where rock and hip hop dominate over pop music while all kinds of alternative music genres are encouraged 210 the origins of polish music can be traced as far back as the 13th century manuscripts have been found in stary sącz containing polyphonic compositions related to the parisian notre dame school other early compositions such as the melody of bogurodzica and bóg się rodzi a coronation polonaise for polish kings by an unknown composer may also date back to this period however the first known notable composer mikołaj z radomia was born and lived in the 15th century during the 16th century two main musical groups  both based in kraków and belonging to the king and archbishop of wawel  led to the rapid development of polish music composers writing during this period include wacław z szamotuł mikołaj zieleński and mikołaj gomółka diomedes cato a native-born italian who lived in kraków from about the age of five became a renowned lutenist at the court of sigismund iii and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern europe but blended them with native folk music 211 at the end of the 18th century polish classical music evolved into national forms like the polonaise in the 19th century the most popular composers were józef elsner and his pupils fryderyk chopin and ignacy dobrzyński important opera composers of the era were karol kurpiński and stanisław moniuszko whilst the list of famous soloists and composers included henryk wieniawski juliusz zarębski at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the most prominent composers could said to have been władysław zeleński and mieczysław karłowicz with karol szymanowski gaining prominence prior to world war ii alexandre tansman lived in paris but had strong connections with poland witold lutosławski henryk górecki and krzysztof penderecki composed in poland andrzej panufnik emigrated traditional polish folk music has had a major effect on the works of many well-known polish composers and no more so than on fryderyk chopin a widely recognised national hero of the arts all of chopins works involve the piano and are technically demanding emphasising nuance and expressive depth as a great composer chopin invented the musical form known as the instrumental ballade and made major innovations to the piano sonata mazurka waltz nocturne polonaise étude impromptu and prélude he was also the composer of a number of polonaises which borrowed heavily from traditional polish folk music it is largely thanks to him that the such pieces gained great popularity throughout europe during the 19th century nowadays the most distinctive folk music can be heard in the towns and villages of the mountainous south particularly in the region surrounding the winter resort town of zakopane today poland has a very active music scene with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular among the contemporary populace polish jazz musicians such as krzysztof komeda created a unique style which was most famous in the 1960s and 1970s and continues to be popular to this day since the fall of communism poland has become a major venue for large-scale music festivals chief among which are the opener festival opole festival and sopot festival visual arts polish art has always reflected european trends while maintaining its unique character the kraków

polish art its main representative being jozef chełmoński the młoda polska young poland movement witnessed the birth of modern polish art and engaged in a great deal of formal experimentation led by jacek malczewski symbolism stanisław wyspiański józef mehoffer and a group of polish impressionists artists of the twentieth-century avant-garde represented various schools and trends the art of tadeusz makowski was influenced by cubism while władysław strzemiński and henryk stażewski worked within the constructivist idiom distinguished contemporary artists include roman opałka leon tarasewicz jerzy nowosielski wojciech siudmak mirosław bałka and katarzyna kozyra and zbigniew wąsiel in the younger generation the most celebrated polish sculptors include xawery dunikowski katarzyna

romanesque architecture is represented by st andrews church kraków and st marys church gdańsk is characteristic for the brick gothic style found in poland richly decorated attics and arcade loggias are the common elements of the polish renaissance architecture 213 214 as evident in the city hall in poznań for some time the late renaissance style known as mannerism most notably in the bishops palace in kielce coexisted with the early baroque style typified in the church of saints peter and paul in kraków history has not been kind to polands architectural monuments nonetheless a number of ancient structures has survived castles churches and stately homes often unique in the regional or european context some of them have been painstakingly restored like wawel castle or completely reconstructed after being destroyed in the second world war including the old town and royal castle of warsaw and the old town of gdańsk the architecture of gdańsk is mostly of the hanseatic variety a gothic style common among the former trading cities along the baltic sea and in the northern part of central europe the architectural style of wrocław is mainly representative of german architecture since it was for centuries located within the german states the centre of kazimierz dolny on the vistula is a good example of a well-preserved medieval town polands ancient capital kraków ranks among the best-preserved gothic and renaissance urban complexes in europe meanwhile the legacy of the kresy marchlands of polands eastern regions where wilno and lwów now vilnius and lviv were recognised as two major centres for the arts played a special role in the development of polish architecture with catholic church architecture deserving special note 197 the second half of the 17th century is marked by baroque architecture side towers such as those of branicki palace in białystok are typical for the polish baroque the classical silesian baroque is represented by the university in wrocław the profuse decorations of the branicki palace in warsaw are characteristic of the rococo style the centre of polish classicism was warsaw under the rule of the last polish king stanisław august poniatowski 215 the palace on the water is the most notable example of polish neoclassical architecture lublin castle represents the gothic revival style in architecture while the izrael poznański

his works in polish along with mikołaj rej also notable are the 19th and 20th-century polish authors such as bolesław prus kornel makuszyński stanisław lem and witold gombrowicz among others media
