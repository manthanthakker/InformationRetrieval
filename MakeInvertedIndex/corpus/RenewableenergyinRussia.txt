renewable energy in russia renewable energy in russia mainly consists of hydroelectric energy the country is the sixth largest producer of renewable energy in the world although it is 56th when hydroelectric energy is not taken into account 1 some 179twh of russias energy production comes from renewable energy sources out of a total economically feasible potential of 1823twh 2 16 of russias electricity is generated from hydropower and less than 1 is generated from all other renewable energy sources combined roughly 68 of russias electricity is generated from thermal power and 16 from nuclear power 3 while most of the large hydropower plants in russia date from the soviet era the abundance of fossil fuels in the soviet union and the russian federation has resulted in little need for the development of other renewable energy sources there are currently plans to develop all types of renewable energy which is strongly encouraged by the russian government 4 russian prime minister dmitry medvedev has called for renewable energy to have a larger share of russias energy output and has taken steps to promote the development of renewable energy in russia since 2008 5  contents 1

energy are new to russia and have experienced development in recent years however hydroelectric power has a long history in russia dating back to the soviet era the rapid expansion of hydroelectric power in the soviet union began in 1930 when the total installed capacity equaled 600mwh the soviet union built its first windmill in 1941 which had a capacity of 100kw 6 by the time the soviet union collapsed in 1990 it had a total installed capacity of 65 gwh the largest dams that russia currently has including the sayanoshushenskaya dam were built in the 1950s and 1960s 7 from the 1970s to 2000 the soviet union and russia focused mainly on traditional power sources thermal- hydro- and nuclear power 6 however in 1986 the soviet government announced new energy goals which included further hydroelectric plant construction as well as the start of small-scale solar and wind use for electricity production overall soviet energy policy focused on nuclear and thermal power although renewable energy was not completely neglected the dissolution of the soviet union prevented those goals from being fulfilled 8 the construction of the large dams prominent in soviet times largely ended in the 1990s with the creation of the russian federation in addition due to the post-soviet recession much of the countrys infrastructure including dams fell into disrepair 7 9 use of oil and gas for energy took priority in russia and renewable energy was ignored this policy lasted until 2008 when medvedev announced reforms to russias energy policies in an attempt to focus more on renewable energy since then there has been rapid development of new renewable energy sources 10 current statusedit russia is one of the worlds largest producers of energy most of which it obtains from oil natural gas and coal the countrys focus on those resources for production and export which constitute 80 of foreign trade earnings means it has paid little attention to renewable energy out of the 203gw of electric generation capacity that russia has 44gw comes from hydroelectricity 307mw from geothermal 15mw from wind and negligible amounts from other renewable sources 11 12 in 2009 the russian energy industry generated a total 992twh of electricity 176twh of which was produced by hydroelectric power stations 13 some of russias hydroelectric power plants are outdated and are in need of additional investment as shown by the accident at the sayano-shushenskaya hpp in 2009 1 president dmitry medvedev announced in may 2010 that the russian government would strongly consider purchasing electricity generated from renewable energy sources in an attempt to encourage development of renewable energy the government has plans for 4.5 of russias energy output to come from non-hydroelectric renewable energy sources 5 additionally in november 2010 the government approved a us$300billion program to make factories and buildings more energy efficient it also announced plans to construct eight energy-efficient lamp production plants promote recycling and support the construction of a hybrid car plant medvedev announced in late 2009 that he wanted to cut russian energy consumption by 40 by 2020 10 14 at the moment development is slowed by low investment economic instability low public demand and low tariffs on heat and electricity 15 subsidies for natural gas are another obstacle to renewable energy development 16 hydropoweredit hydropower is the most used form of renewable energy in russia and there is large potential in russia for more use of hydropower russia has 102 hydropower plants with capacities of over 100mw making it fifth in the world for hydropower production it is also second in the world for hydro potential yet only 20 of this potential is developed 7 russia is home to 9 of the worlds hydro resources 15 mostly in siberia and the countrys far east at the end of 2005 the generating capacity from hydroelectric sources in russia was 45,700mw and an additional 5,648mw was under construction the world energy council believes that russia has much potential for using its hydro resources with a theoretical potential of about 2,295twhyr with 852twh being economically feasible 12 the largest dams in russia are the sayano-shushenskaya dam which has an installed capacity of 6,400mw the krasnoyarsk dam  6,000mw the bratsk dam  4,500mw the ust-ilimsk dam  4,320mw and the zeya dam  1,330mw 7 some of the most recent dam projects are the bureya dam  2010mw and the irganai dam  800mw the boguchany dam  1920mw zelenchuk dam  320mw zaramag dam  352mw and nizhne-chereksky  60mw are currently under construction 12 rushydro is the largest hydroelectric company in russia and the second largest hydroelectric producer in the world 17 in october 2010 china yangtze power the largest hydropower corporation in china and eurosibenergo a russian energy company signed a cooperation agreement to expand hydroelectric energy production in russia and export energy to chinas northern territories 18 the west siberian generating company has plans to start construction of eight mini-hydroelectric power plants in the altai region before 2015 19 on 17 august 2009 there was an explosion at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric power plant which killed 75 plant workers and injured 13 the federal service for ecological technological and nuclear supervisions investigation concluded that poor management and technical flaws were responsible 20 the explosion was caused by a 29-year-old turbine that experienced an uncontrolled and excessive vibration since then officials from rushydro the operator of the plant have called for better oversight and safety at hydroelectric plants 20 21 geothermal energyedit geothermal energy is the second most used form of renewable energy in russia but represents less than 1 of the total energy production the first geothermal power plant in russia was built at pauzhetka kamchatka in 1966 with a capacity of 5mw the total geothermal installed capacity in 2005 was 79mw with 50mw coming from a plant at verkhne-mutnovsky russia is currently developing a 100mw plant at mutnovsky and a 50mw plant in kaliningrad 12 most geothermal resources are currently used for heating settlements in the north caucasus and kamchatka half of the geothermal production is used to heat homes and industrial buildings one third is used to heat greenhouses and 13 is used for industrial processes 22 in october 2010 sergei shmatko russias energy minister stated that russia and iceland would work together to develop kamchatkas geothermal energy sources 23 russia is also investigating foreign investment possibilities for developing geothermal energy in the kuril islands 24 solar energyedit source nrel 25 solar energy is virtually nonexistent in russia despite its large potential in the country the first russian solar plant was opened in belgorod oblast in november 2010 26 russia has a total theoretical potential of 2,213twhyr for solar energy with an economically feasible amount of 101twh the southern parts of russia especially the north caucasus have the greatest potential for solar energy 12 russia plans to set up an overall solar capacity of 150mw by 2020 27 plans for the construction of a new solar plant on the black sea have been announced and the plant is expected to begin operations by 2012 this plant which will have a capacity of 12.3mw is being built by rusnano and renova 28 solar wind llc and rusnano are building a plant that will produce double-sided solar panels which will be able to collect solar energy from both sides construction is expected to finish in early 2011 and the plant will have an annual manufacturing capacity of 30mw 27 nitol solar is the largest russian company in the area of scientific development and manufacture of products used to generate solar energy 29 russia and india are currently discussing the possibility of a joint venture to produce silicon wafers for the creation of photovoltaic cells 30 an auction in 2013 awarded contracts for 399 mw of solar and one in 2014 an additional 505 mw 31 a third auction in 2015 awarded 280 mw of solar 32 in 2015 the russian solar energy association predicted that cumulative solar power capacity in the country would rise to 1,500 mw by 2020 33 wind energyedit russia has a long history of small-scale wind energy use but has never developed large-scale commercial wind energy production most of its current wind production is located in agricultural areas with low population densities where connection to the main energy grid is difficult russia is estimated to have a total potential of 80,000 twhyr for wind energy 6,218twhyr of which is economically feasible 12 most of this potential is found in the southern steppes and the seacoasts of russia although in many of these areas the population density is less than 1 person per square km this low population density means that there is little existing electricity infrastructure currently in place which hinders development of these resources 6 in 2006 russia had a total installed wind capacity of 15mw 34 current russian wind energy projects have a combined capacity of over 1,700mw the russian wind energy association predicts that if russia achieves its goal of having 4.5 of its energy come from renewable sources by 2020 the country will have a total wind capacity of 7gw 35 in 2010 plans for the construction of a wind power plant in yeisk on the sea of azov were announced it is expected to initially have a capacity of 50mw which will become 100mw a year later 34 german engineering company siemens announced in july 2010 following a visit to russia by chancellor angela merkel that it would build wind power plants in russia 1 by 2015 the company hopes to install 1,250mw of capacity in russia 35 tidal energyedit russia has many tidal energy resources at its disposal although they are currently underdeveloped as well the kola bay and sea of okhotsk alone could produce 100gw with tidal power stations and the national energy potential from tidal energy can compete with current total energy production 36 the currently active kislaya guba tidal power station is the largest tidal power facility in russia and has the fourth largest capacity  1.7mw among the worlds tidal power plants 37 plans for constructing an 800mw tidal power plant in the barents sea were announced in 2008 38 possible long-term projects include the penzhin tidal power plant which could become the largest power station in the world with an installed capacity of up to 87gw and an annual production of 200twh 39 biofueledit russias biofuel industry is new but it has been developing rapidly in recent years russia is one of the largest grain producers has a well-developed ethyl alcohol industry and has increasing rapeseed often used to create biodiesel production rates 40 the russian government declared in 2008 that it would play an active role in developing the biofuel industry by building 30 new biofuel plants and providing tax breaks and subsidized interest rates to biofuel energy projects 41 although these plans were delayed on 13 september 2010 medvedev announced that construction would begin in early 2011 42 biobutanol the biofuel produced by these plants would be produced from timber by-products such as woodchips and sawdust 40 41 43 lada a russian car manufacturer produced its first biofuel-powered automobile in november 2010 deputy transportation minister valery okulov stated that russian companies are currently developing helicopters that run on biofuel 41 russia hopes to export biofuel to the european union 44 the countrys biotechnology corporation estimates that russia is capable of exporting 40 million tons of biofuel annually 45 biomassedit biomass is already used in some parts of russia to provide a total of 1 or 9twhyear of russias total energy however due to russias vast forest and peat reservesnb 1 it has a total biomass technical potential of 431twhyear of which 285twhyear is economically feasible 46 47 most of this potential is found in northwestern russia which has a developed pulp and paper industry that can provide wood-based waste to use as biomass energy 48 use of peat for energy production was prominent during the soviet union with the peak occurring in 1965 and declining from that point in 1929 over 40 of the soviet unions electric energy came from peat which dropped to 1 by 1980 currently russia is responsible for 17 of the worlds peat production and 20 of the peat that it produces 1.5 million tons is used for energy purposes 12 49 shatura power station in moscow oblast and kirov power station in kirov oblast are the two largest peat power stations in the world 50 51
