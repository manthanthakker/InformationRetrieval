moura photovoltaic power station the moura photovoltaic power station also known as amareleja photovoltaic power station is a large photovoltaic power station in amareleja in the municipality of moura portugal it is one of the largest power stations of its kind and is built in one of the sunniest regions in europe 1 its construction involved two stages stage 1 was completed in 2008 after 13 months and stage 2 was completed in 2010 the entire project topped a total cost of €250 million 2 stage 2 of the project involved the construction of a further 20mw of solar panels 3 4 it will occupy an area of 618 acres  250ha and will be capable of producing 93gwh of electrical energy annually 5  10 mw average - equivalent to the electricity consumption of 15,000 europeans 6 the power station has an installed capacity of 62mwp with more than 376,000 solar panels 6 approximately 190,000 panels  32mw are fitted on fixed structures and 52,000 panels  10mw are fixed on single-axis trackers a €7.6 million solar panel factory located in moura was constructed by acciona which provided panels for stage 2 of the station construction its future production will be targeted at the international market with a capacity of producing 24mw of solar panels annually 7 see alsoedit renewable energy portal energy portal energy policy of the european union list of largest power stations in the world
