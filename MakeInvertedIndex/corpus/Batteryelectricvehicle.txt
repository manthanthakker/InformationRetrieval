battery electric vehicle a battery electric vehicle bev battery-only electric vehicle boev or all-electric vehicle is a type of electric vehicle ev that uses chemical energy stored in rechargeable battery packs bevs use electric motors and motor controllers instead of internal combustion engines ices for propulsion they derive all power from battery packs and thus have no internal combustion engine fuel cell or fuel tank bevs include bicycles scooters skateboards rail cars watercraft forklifts buses trucks and cars since the introduction of the all-electric nissan leaf in december 2010 about 1 million highway legal plug-in electric vehicles have been sold worldwide by mid-september 2015 of which about 620,000 are all-electric passenger cars and light-duty trucks 2 as of june

internal combustion engines are examples of hybrid electric vehicles and are not considered pure or all-electric vehicles because they cannot be externally charged operate in charge-sustaining mode and instead they are continually recharged with power from the internal combustion engine and regenerative braking 4 hybrid vehicles with batteries that can be charged externally to displace some or all of their internal combustion engine power and gasoline fuel are called plug-in hybrid electric vehicles phev and run as bevs during their charge-depleting mode phevs with a series powertrain are also called range-extended electric vehicles reevs such as the chevrolet volt and fisker karma plug-in electric vehicles pevs are a subcategory of electric vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles bevs plug-in hybrid vehicles phevs and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles 4 5 in china plug-in electric vehicles together with hybrid electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles nevs 6 however in the united states neighborhood electric vehicles nevs are battery electric vehicles that are legally limited to roads with posted speed limits no higher than 45 miles per hour  72kmh are usually built to have a top speed of 30 miles per hour  48kmh and have a maximum loaded weight of 3,000lbs 7 vehicles by typeedit the concept of battery electric vehicles is to use charged batteries on board vehicles for propulsion battery electric cars are becoming more and more attractive with the advancement of new battery technology lithium ion that have higher power and energy density ie greater possible acceleration and more range with fewer batteries and higher oil prices 8 bevs include automobiles light

public transport system 22 first fast-charge battery-electric transit busedit proterras ecoride be35 transit bus called the ecoliner by foothill transit in west covina california is a heavy duty fast charge battery-electric bus proterras prodrive drive-system uses a uqm motor and regenerative braking that captures 90 percent of the available energy and returns it to the terravolt energy storage system which in turn increases the total distance the bus can drive by 31–35 percent it can travel 30–40 miles on a single charge is up to 600 percent more fuel-efficient than a typical diesel or cng bus and produces 44 percent less carbon than cng 23 electric trucksedit for most of the 20th century the majority of the worlds battery electric road vehicles were british milk floats 24 electric vansedit in march 2012 smith electric vehicles announced the release of the newton step-van an all-electric zero-emission vehicle built on the versatile newton platform that features a walk-in body produced by indiana-based utilimaster 25 electric carsedit an electric car is a plug-in battery powered automobile which is propelled by electric motors although electric cars often give good acceleration and have generally acceptable top speed the lower specific energy of production batteries available in 2015 compared with carbon-based fuels means that electric cars need batteries that are fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give relatively low range between charges recharging can also take significant lengths of time for journeys within a single battery charge rather than long journeys electric cars are practical forms of transportation and can be recharged overnight electric cars have the potential of significantly reducing city pollution by having zero tail pipe emissions 29 30 31 vehicle greenhouse gas savings depend on how the electricity is generated 32 33 with the current us energy mix using an electric car would result in a 30 percent reduction

devices for standing on such as the segway pt or self-balancing two-wheeled boards three-wheeled vehicles include electric rickshaws a powered variant of the cycle rickshaw technologyedit v t e motorsedit electric cars have traditionally used series wound dc motors a form of brushed dc electric motor separately excited and permanent magnet are just two of the types of dc motors available more recent electric vehicles have made use of a variety of ac motor types as these are simpler to build and have no brushes that can wear out these are usually induction motors or brushless ac electric motors which use permanent magnets there are several variations of the permanent magnet motor which offer simpler drive schemes andor lower cost including the brushless dc electric motor motor controllersedit the motor controller regulates the power to the motor supplying either variable pulse width dc or variable frequency variable amplitude ac depending on the motor type dc or ac
