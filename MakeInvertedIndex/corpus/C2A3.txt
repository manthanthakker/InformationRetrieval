was advantageous to have commonly used characters available in the lower 7-bit ascii table denoted as chr$96 or hex chr&60 since the bbc micro used a teletext mode as standard this means that the pound sign is in the 7-bit ascii variant used on teletext systems such as ceefax oracle and teletext ltd as well on latin-alphabet typewriters lacking a  symbol type element a reasonable approximation can be made by typing an f over an l pcedit on microsoft windows linux and unix the uk keyboard layout has the  symbol on the 3 number key and is typed using  shift+3 on a us-international keyboard in

156 for most other printers including the ibm quietwriter and epson dot matrix printers in order to print a pound sign each word processor needed to be set up individually to print the sign for a particular printer for many word processors a terminate and stay resident program tsr was needed to convert the code generated by the package into the right code for the printer packages such as wordperfect had utilities to set up this conversion without needing a tsr see alsoedit ł ł latin letter l with stroke parlophone referencesedit v t e           ƒ                         dm    ℳ   ℛℳ
