e green building also known as green construction or sustainable building refers to both a structure and the using of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a buildings life-cycle from siting to design construction operation maintenance renovation and demolition 1 in other words green building design involves finding the balance between homebuilding and the sustainable environment this requires close cooperation of the design team the architects the engineers and the client at all project stages 2 the green building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy utility durability and comfort 3 leadership in energy and environmental design leed is a set of rating systems for the design construction operation and maintenance of green buildings which was developed by the us green building council other certificates system that confirms the sustainability of buildings is the british breeam building research establishment environmental assessment method for buildings and large scale developments currently world green building council is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with world bank to promote green buildings in emerging markets through edge excellence in design for greater efficiencies market transformation program and certification 4 although new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures the common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by efficiently using energy water and other resources protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity reducing waste pollution and environmental degradation 3 a similar concept is natural building which is usually on a smaller scale and tends to focus on the use of natural materials that are available locally 5 other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs 6 although some green building programs dont address the issue of the retrofitting existing homes others do especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction a 2009 report by the us general services administration found 12 sustainably-designed buildings that cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance in addition occupants were overall more satisfied with the building than those in typical commercial buildingsthese are

country 6.2 general  reducing environmental impactedit globally buildings are responsible for a huge share of energy electricity water and materials consumption the building sector has the greatest potential to deliver significant cuts in emissions at little or no cost buildings account for 18  8 of global emissions today or the equivalent of 9 billion tonnes of co2 annually if new technologies in construction are not adopted during this time of rapid growth emissions could double by 2050 according to the united nations environment programgreen building practices aim to reduce the environmental impact of building since construction almost always degrades a building site not building at all is preferable to green building in terms of reducing environmental impact the second rule is that every building should be as small as possible the third rule is not to contribute to sprawl even if the most energy-efficient environmentally sound methods are used in design and construction buildings account for a large amount of land according to the national resources inventory approximately 107million acres  430,000km2 of land in the united states are developed the international energy agency released a publication that estimated that existing buildings are responsible for more than 40 of the worlds total primary energy consumption and for 24 of global carbon dioxide emissions 9 goals of green buildingedit the concept of sustainable development can be traced to the energy especially fossil oil crisis and environmental pollution concerns of the 1960s and 1970s 10 the rachel carson book silent spring 11 published in 1962 is considered to be one of the first initial efforts to describe sustainable development as related to green building 12 the green building movement in the us originated from the need and desire for more energy efficient and environmentally friendly construction practices there are a number of motives for building green including environmental economic and social benefits however modern sustainability initiatives call for an integrated and synergistic design to both new construction and in the retrofitting of existing structures also known as sustainable design this approach integrates the building life-cycle with each green practice employed with a design-purpose to create a synergy among the practices used green building brings together a vast array of practices techniques and skills to reduce and ultimately eliminate the impacts of buildings on the environment and human health it often emphasizes taking advantage of renewable resources eg using sunlight through passive solar active solar and photovoltaic equipment and using plants and trees through green roofs rain gardens and reduction of rainwater run-off many other techniques are used such as using low-impact building materials or using packed gravel or permeable concrete instead of conventional concrete or asphalt to enhance replenishment of ground water while the practices or technologies employed in green building are constantly evolving and may differ from region to region fundamental principles persist from which the method is derived siting and structure design efficiency energy efficiency water efficiency materials efficiency indoor environmental quality enhancement operations and maintenance optimization and waste and toxics reduction 13 14 the essence of green building is an optimization of one or more of these principles also with the proper synergistic design individual green building technologies may work together to produce a greater cumulative effect on the aesthetic side of green architecture or sustainable design is the philosophy of designing a building that is in harmony with the natural features and resources surrounding the site there are several key steps in designing sustainable buildings specify green building materials from local sources reduce loads optimize systems and generate on-site renewable energy life cycle assessmentedit a life cycle assessment lca can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental social and economic concerns 15 by assessing a full range of impacts associated with all cradle-to-grave stages of a process from extraction of raw materials through materials processing manufacture distribution use repair and maintenance and disposal or recycling impacts taken into account include among others embodied energy global warming potential resource use air pollution water pollution and waste in terms of green building the last few years have seen a shift away from a prescriptive approach which assumes that certain prescribed practices are better for the environment toward the scientific evaluation of actual performance through lca although lca is widely recognized as the best way to evaluate the environmental impacts of buildings iso 14040 provides a recognized lca methodology it is not yet a consistent requirement of green building rating systems and codes despite the fact that embodied energy and other life cycle impacts are critical to the design of environmentally responsible buildings in north america lca is rewarded to some extent in the green globes rating system and is part of the new american national standard based on green globes ansigbi 01-2010 green building protocol for commercial buildings lca is also included as a pilot credit in the leed system though a decision has not been made as to whether it will be incorporated fully into the next major revision the state of california also included lca as a voluntary measure in its 2010 draft green building standards code although lca is often perceived as overly complex and time consuming for regular use by design professionals research organizations such as bre in the uk and the athena sustainable materials institute in north america are working to make it more accessible in the uk the bre green guide to specifications offers ratings for 1,500 building materials based on lca in north america the athena ecocalculator for assemblies provides lca results for several hundred common building assembles based on data generated by its more complex parent software the athena impact estimator for buildings the ecocalculator is available free at wwwathenasmiorg athena software tools are especially useful early in the design process when material choices have far-reaching implications for overall environmental impact they allow designers to experiment with different material mixes to achieve the most effective combination siting and structure design efficiencyedit the foundation of any construction project is rooted in the concept and design stages the concept stage in fact is one of the major steps in a project life cycle as it has the largest impact on cost and performance 16 in designing environmentally optimal buildings the objective is to minimize the total environmental impact associated with all life-cycle stages of the building project however building as a process is not as streamlined as an industrial process and varies from one building to the other never repeating itself identically in addition buildings are much more complex products composed of a multitude of materials and components each constituting various design variables to be decided at the design stage a variation of every design variable may affect the environment during all the buildings relevant life-cycle stages 17 energy efficiencyedit green buildings often include measures to reduce energy consumption  both the embodied energy required to extract process transport and install building materials and operating energy to provide services such as heating and power for equipment as high-performance buildings use less operating energy embodied energy has assumed much greater importance  and may make up as much as 30 of the overall life cycle energy consumption studies such as the us lci database project 18 show buildings built primarily with wood will have a lower embodied energy than those built primarily with brick concrete or steel 19 to reduce operating energy use designers use details that reduce air leakage through the building envelope the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space they also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls ceilings and floors another strategy passive solar building design is often implemented in low-energy homes designers orient windows and walls and place awnings porches and trees 20 to shade windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter in addition effective window placement daylighting can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day solar water heating further reduces energy costs onsite generation of renewable energy through solar power wind power hydro power or biomass can significantly reduce the environmental impact of the building power generation is generally the most expensive feature to add to a building water efficiencyedit reducing water consumption and protecting water quality are key objectives in sustainable building one critical issue of water consumption is that in many areas the demands on the supplying aquifer exceed its ability to replenish itself to the maximum extent feasible facilities should increase their dependence on water that is collected used purified and reused on-site the protection and conservation of water throughout the life of a building may be accomplished by designing for dual plumbing that recycles water in toilet flushing or by using water for washing of the cars waste-water may be minimized by utilizing water conserving fixtures such as ultra-low flush toilets and low-flow shower heads bidets help eliminate the use of toilet paper reducing sewer traffic and increasing possibilities of re-using water on-site point of use water treatment and heating improves both water quality and energy efficiency while reducing the amount of water in circulation the use of non-sewage and greywater for on-site use such as site-irrigation will minimize demands on the local aquifer 21 large commercial buildings with water and energy efficiency can qualify for an leed certification philadelphias comcast center is the tallest building in philadelphia its also one of the tallest buildings in the usa that is leed certified their environmental engineering consists of a hybrid central chilled water system which cools floor-by-floor with steam instead of water burns mechanical set-up the entire renovation of the 58 story 1.4 million square foot sky scraper materials efficiencyedit building materials typically considered to be green include lumber from forests that have been certified to a third-party forest standard rapidly renewable plant materials like bamboo and straw dimension stone recycled stone recycled metal see copper sustainability and recyclability and other products that are non-toxic reusable renewable andor recyclable for concrete a high performance or roman self-healing concrete is available 22 23 the epa environmental protection agency also suggests using recycled industrial goods such as coal combustion products foundry sand and demolition debris in construction projects 24 energy efficient building materials and appliances are promoted in the united states through energy rebate programs indoor environmental quality enhancementedit the indoor environmental quality ieq category in leed standards one of the five environmental categories was created to provide comfort well-being and productivity of occupants the leed ieq category addresses design and construction guidelines especially indoor air quality iaq thermal quality and lighting quality 25 26 27 indoor air quality seeks to reduce volatile organic compounds or vocs and other air impurities such as microbial contaminants buildings rely on a properly designed ventilation system passivelynaturally or mechanically powered to provide adequate ventilation of cleaner air from outdoors or recirculated filtered air as well as isolated operations kitchens dry cleaners etc from other occupancies during the design and construction process choosing construction materials and interior finish products with zero or low voc emissions will improve iaq most building materials and cleaningmaintenance products emit gases some of them toxic such as many vocs including formaldehyde these gases can have a detrimental impact on occupants health comfort and productivity avoiding these products will increase a buildings ieq leed 28 hqe 29 and green star contain specifications on use of low-emitting interior draft leed 2012 30 is about to expand the scope of the involved products breeam 31 limits formaldehyde emissions no other vocs mas certified green is a registered trademark to delineate low voc-emitting products in the marketplace 32 the mas certified green program ensures that any potentially hazardous chemicals released from manufactured products have been thoroughly tested and meet rigorous standards established by independent toxicologists to address recognized long term health concerns these iaq standards have been adopted by and incorporated into the following programs  1 the united states green building council usgbc in their leed rating system 33  2 the california department of public health cdph in their section 01350 standards 34  3 the collaborative for high performance schools chps in their best practices manual 35 and  4 the business and institutional furniture manufacturers association bifma in their level sustainability standard 36 also important to indoor air quality is the control of moisture accumulation dampness leading to mold growth and the presence of bacteria and viruses as well as dust mites and other organisms and microbiological concerns water intrusion through a buildings envelope or water condensing on cold surfaces on the buildings interior can enhance and sustain microbial growth a well-insulated and tightly sealed envelope will reduce moisture problems but adequate ventilation is also necessary to eliminate moisture from sources indoors including human metabolic processes cooking bathing cleaning and other activities personal temperature and airflow control over the hvac system coupled with a properly designed building envelope will also aid in increasing a buildings thermal quality creating a high performance luminous environment through the careful integration of daylight and electrical light sources will improve on the lighting quality and energy performance of a structure 21 37 solid wood products particularly flooring are often specified in environments where occupants are known to have allergies to dust or other particulates wood itself is considered to be hypo-allergenic and its smooth surfaces prevent the buildup of particles common in soft finishes like carpet the asthma and allergy foundation of american recommends hardwood vinyl linoleum tile or slate flooring instead of carpet 38 the use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity 39 interactions among all the indoor components and the occupants together form the processes that determine the indoor air quality extensive investigation of such processes is the subject of indoor air scientific research and is well documented in the journal indoor air 40 operations and maintenance optimizationedit no matter how sustainable a building may have been in its design and construction it can only remain so if it is operated responsibly and maintained properly ensuring operations and maintenanceom personnel are part of the projects planning and development process will help retain the green criteria designed at the onset of the project 41 every aspect of green building is integrated into the om phase of a buildings life the addition of new green technologies also falls on the om staff although the goal of waste reduction may be applied during the design construction and demolition phases of a buildings life-cycle it is in the om phase that green practices such as recycling and air quality enhancement take place om staff should aim to establish best practices in energy efficiency resource conservation ecologically sensitive products and other sustainable practices education of building operators and occupants is key to effective implementation of sustainable strategies in om services 42 waste reductionedit green architecture also seeks to reduce waste of energy water and materials used during construction for example in california nearly 60 of the states waste comes from commercial buildings 43 during the construction phase one goal should be to reduce the amount of material going to landfills well-designed buildings also help reduce the amount of waste generated by the occupants as well by providing on-site solutions such as compost bins to reduce matter going to landfills to reduce the amount of wood that goes to landfill neutral alliance a coalition of government ngos and the forest industry created the website dontwastewoodcom the site includes a variety of resources for regulators municipalities developers contractors owneroperators and individualshomeowners looking for information on wood recycling when buildings reach the end of their useful life they are typically demolished and hauled to landfills deconstruction is a method of harvesting what is commonly considered waste and reclaiming it into useful building material 44 extending the useful life of a structure also reduces waste  building materials such as wood that are light and easy to work with make renovations easier 45 to reduce the impact on wells or water treatment plants several options exist greywater wastewater from sources such as dishwashing or washing machines can be used for subsurface irrigation or if treated for non-potable purposes eg to flush toilets and wash cars rainwater collectors are used for similar purposes centralized wastewater treatment systems can be costly and use a lot of energy an alternative to this process is converting waste and wastewater into fertilizer which avoids these costs and shows other benefits by collecting human waste at the source and running it to a semi-centralized biogas plant with other biological waste liquid fertilizer can be produced this concept was demonstrated by a settlement in lubeck germany in the late 1990s practices like these provide soil with organic nutrients and create carbon sinks that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere offsetting greenhouse gas emission producing artificial fertilizer is also more costly in energy than this process 46 cost and payoffedit the most criticized issue about constructing environmentally friendly buildings is the price photo-voltaics new appliances and modern technologies tend to cost more money most green buildings cost a premium of <2 but yield 10 times as much over the entire life of the building 47 in regards to the financial benefits of green building over 20 years the financial payback typically exceeds the additional cost of greening by a factor of 4-6 times and broader benefits such as reductions in greenhouse gases ghgs and other pollutants have large positive impacts on surrounding communities and on the planet 48 the stigma is between the knowledge of up-front cost 49 vs life-cycle cost the savings in money come from more efficient use of utilities which result in decreased energy bills it is projected that different sectors could save $130 billion on energy bills 50 also higher worker or student productivity can be factored into savings and cost deductions numerous studies have shown the measurable benefit of green building initiatives on worker productivity in general it has been found that there is a direct correlation between increased productivity and employees who love being in their work space 51 specifically worker productivity can be significantly impacted by certain aspects of green building design such as improved lighting reduction of pollutants advanced ventilation systems and the use of non-toxic building materials 52 in the business case for green building the us green building council gives another specific example of how commercial energy retrofits increase worker health and thus productivity people in the us spend about 90 of their time indoors epa studies indicate indoor levels of pollutants may be up to ten times higher than outdoor levels leed-certified buildings are designed to have healthier cleaner indoor environmental quality which means health benefits for occupants 53 studies have shown over a 20-year life period some green buildings have yielded $53 to $71 per square foot back on investment 54 confirming the rentability of green building investments further studies of the commercial real estate market have found that leed and energy star certified buildings achieve significantly higher rents sale prices and occupancy rates as well as lower capitalization rates potentially reflecting lower investment risk 55 56 57 regulation and operationedit as a result of the increased interest in green building concepts and practices a number of organizations have developed standards codes and rating systems that let government regulators building professionals and consumers embrace green building with confidence in some cases codes are written so local governments can adopt them as bylaws to reduce the local environmental impact of buildings green building rating systems such as breeam united kingdom leed united states and canada dgnb germany casbee japan and verdegbce spain help consumers determine a structures level of environmental performance they award credits for optional building features that support green design in categories such as location and maintenance of building site conservation of water energy and building materials and occupant comfort and health the number of credits generally determines the level of achievement 58 green building codes and standards such as the international code councils draft international green construction code 59 are sets of rules created by standards development organizations that establish minimum requirements for elements of green building such as materials or heating and cooling some of the major building environmental assessment tools currently in use include united states international green construction code igcc international frameworks and assessment toolsedit ipcc fourth assessment report climate change 2007 the fourth assessment report ar4 of the united nations intergovernmental

in every area in which humans impact on the environment the number 21 refers to the 21st century fidics psm the international federation of consulting engineers fidic project sustainability management guidelines were created in order to assist project engineers and other stakeholders in setting sustainable development goals for their projects that are recognized and accepted by as being in the interests of society as a whole the process is also intended to allow the alignment of project goals with local conditions and priorities and to assist those involved in managing projects to measure and verify their progress the project sustainability management guidelines are structured with themes and sub-themes under the three main sustainability headings of social environmental and economic for each individual sub-theme a core project indicator is defined along with guidance as to the relevance of that issue in the context of an individual project the sustainability reporting framework provides guidance for organizations to use as the basis for disclosure about their sustainability performance and also provides stakeholders a universally applicable comparable framework in which to understand disclosed information the reporting framework contains the core product of the sustainability reporting guidelines as well as protocols and sector supplements the guidelines are used as the basis for all reporting they are the foundation upon which all other reporting guidance is based and outline core content for reporting that is broadly relevant to all organizations regardless of size sector or location the guidelines contain principles and guidance as well as standard disclosures  including indicators  to outline a disclosure framework that organizations can voluntarily ﬂexibly and incrementally adopt protocols underpin each indicator in the guidelines and include definitions for key terms in the indicator compilation methodologies intended scope of the indicator and other technical references sector supplements respond to the limits of a one-size-ﬁts-all approach sector supplements complement the use of the core guidelines by capturing the unique set of sustainability issues faced by different sectors such as mining automotive banking public agencies and others ipd environment code the ipd environment code 61 was launched in february 2008 the code is intended as a good practice global standard for measuring the environmental performance of corporate buildings its aim is to accurately measure and manage the environmental impacts of corporate buildings and enable property executives to generate high quality comparable performance information about their buildings anywhere in the world the code covers a wide range of building types from ofﬁces to airports and aims to inform and support the following creating an environmental strategy inputting to real estate strategy communicating a commitment to environmental improvement creating performance targets environmental improvement plans performance assessment and measurement life cycle assessments acquisition and disposal of buildings supplier management information systems and data population
