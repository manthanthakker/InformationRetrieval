energy-efficient landscaping energy-efficient landscaping is a type of landscaping designed for the purpose of conserving energy there is a distinction between the embedded energy of materials and constructing the landscape and the energy consumed by the maintenance and operations of a landscape design techniques include planting trees for the purpose of providing shade which reduces cooling costs planting or building windbreaks to slow winds near buildings which reduces heat loss wall sheltering where shrubbery or vines are used to create a windbreak directly against a wall earth sheltering and positioning buildings to take advantage of natural landforms as windbreaks green roofs that cool buildings with extra thermal mass and evapotranspiration reducing the heat island effect with pervious paving high albedo paving shade and minimizing paved areas site lighting with full cut off fixtures light level sensors and high efficiency fixtures energy-efficient landscaping techniques include using local materials on-site composting and chipping to reduce greenwaste hauling hand tools instead of gasoline-powered and also may involve using drought-resistant plantings in arid areas buying stock from local growers to avoid energy in transportation and similar techniques see alsoedit gardening portal energy portal sustainable development portal natural materials green building building material energy conservation keyline design drought tolerance drought-tolerant plants roof garden water conservation xeriscaping climate-friendly gardening sustainable gardening sustainable landscape architecture sustainable architecture landscape design landscape architecture garden design landscape planning external linksedit the green building sourcebook has a section on landscaping ecological home ideas magazine for green home buildingremodeling stopwasteorg sustainable residential design increasing energy efficiency resource guide referencesedit
