variable renewable energy variable renewable energy vre is a renewable energy source that is non-dispatchable due to its fluctuating nature like wind power and solar power as opposed to a controllable renewable energy source such as hydroelectricity or biomass or a relatively constant source such as geothermal power or run-of-the-river hydroelectricity skeptics of wind and solar power warn of their variable output but many studies have shown that the grid can cope and it is doing so in denmark germany and spain the international energy agency says that there has been too much attention on issue of the variability of renewable electricity production 2 its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned the balance of plant and the wider connectivity of the system as well as the demand side flexibility variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment but at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management and additional costs may be required for backup or system modification 2 renewable electricity supply in the 20â€“50 penetration range has already been implemented in several european systems albeit in the context of an integrated european grid system 3  contents 1 comparison 2 wind power 3 wave power 4 solar power 5 tidal power 6 run-of-the-river

completely dispatchable as each has a store of potential energy wind and solar production are typically without storage and can be decreased but not dispatched other than when nature provides between wind and solar solar has a more variable daily cycle than wind but is more predictable in daylight hours than wind like solar tidal energy varies between on and off cycles through each day unlike solar there is no intermittentcy tides are available every day without fail biofuel and biomass involve multiple steps in the production of energy  growing plants harvesting processing transportation storage and burning to create heat for electricity transportation or space heating in the combined power plant used by the university of kassel to simulate using 100 renewable energy wind farms and solar farms were supplemented as needed by hydrostorage and biomass to follow the electricity demand 4 wind poweredit wind power is the least predictable of all of the variable renewable energy sources grid operators use day ahead forecasting to determine which of the available power sources to use the next day and weather forecasting is used to predict the likely wind power and solar power output available the correlation between wind output and prediction can be relatively high with an average uncorrected error of 8.8 in germany over a two-year period 5 the variability of wind power can be seen as one of its defining characteristics 6 wave poweredit waves are primarily created by wind so the power available from waves tends to follow that available from wind but due to the mass of the water is less variable than wind power wind power is proportional to the cube of the wind speed while wave power is proportional to the square of the wave height 7 8 9 solar poweredit solar power is more predictable than wind power and less variable  while there is never any solar power available during the night and there is a reduction in winter the only unknown factors in predicting solar output each day is cloud cover frost and snow many days in a row in some locations are relatively cloud free just as many days in a row in either the same or other locations are overcast  leading to relatively high predictability wind comes from the uneven heating of the earths surface 10 and can provide about 1 of the potential energy that is available from solar power 86,000 tw of solar energy reaches the surface of the world vs 870 tw in all of the worlds winds 11 total world demand is roughly 12 tw many times less than the amount that could be generated from potential wind and solar resources from 40 to 85 tw could be provided from wind and about 580 tw from solar 12 tidal poweredit tidal power is the most predictable of all the variable renewable energy sources twice a day the tides vary 100 but they are never intermittent on the contrary they are completely reliable it is estimated that britain could obtain 20 of energy from tidal power only 20 sites in the world have yet been identified as possible tidal power stations 13 run-of-the-river hydroelectricityedit in many european counties and north america the environmental movement has eliminated the construction of dams with large reservoirs run of the river projects have continued to be built such as the 695mw keeyask project in canada which began construction in 2014 14 the absence of a reservoir results in both seasonal and annual variations in electricity generated coping with variabilityedit historically grid operators use day ahead forecasting to choose which power stations to make up demand each hour of the next day and adjust this forecast at intervals as short as hourly or even every fifteen minutes to accommodate any changes normally as much as 100 demand is retained as spinning reserve that can be integrated quickly into the grid to make up for any power station failures or unexpected demand increases 15 a shift in thinking is needed in 2030 when almost all of your energy comes from non-dispatchable sources  how much wind or solar power is available depends on the weather conditions and instead of turning on and off available sources becomes one of either storing or transmission of those sources to when they can be used or to where they can be used 12 some excess available energy can be diverted to hydrogen production for use in ships and airplanes a relatively long term energy storage in a world where almost all of our energy comes from wind water and solar wws hydrogen is not an energy source but is a storage medium a cost analysis will need to be made between long distance transmission and excess capacity the sun is always shining somewhere and the wind is always blowing somewhere on the earth but is it cost effective to bring solar power from australia to new york 12 16 if excess capacity is created the cost is increased because not all of the available output is used for example ercot predicts that 8.7 of nameplate wind capacity will be reliably available in summer 17  so if texas which has a peak summer demand of 68,379 mw 18 built wind farms of 786,000 mw  68,379/0.087 they would generate at a 35 capacity factor 19 2.4 million mwh per year  four times use but might be sufficient to meet summer peaks in practice it is likely that there are times with almost no wind in the entire region making this not a practical solution there were 54 days in 2002 when there was little wind power available in denmark 20 the estimated wind power installed capacity potential for texas using 100 meter wind turbines at 35 capacity factor is 1,757,355.6 mw 21 in locations like british columbia with abundant water power resources water power can always make up any shortfall in wind power 22 wind and solar are somewhat complementary a comparison of the output of the solar panels and the wind turbine at the massachusetts maritime academy shows the effect 23 in winter there tends to be more wind and less solar and in summer more solar and less wind and during the day more solar and less wind there is always no solar at night and there is often more wind at night than during the day so solar can be used somewhat to fill in the peak demand in the day and wind can supply much of the demand during the night there is however a substantial need for storage and transmission to fill in the gaps between demand and supply as physicist amory lovins has said the variability of sun wind and so on turns out to be a non-problem if you do several sensible things one is to diversify your renewables by technology so that weather conditions bad for one kind are good for another second you diversify by site so theyre not all subject to the same weather pattern at the same time because theyre in the same place third you use standard weather forecasting techniques to forecast wind sun and rain and of course hydro operators do this right now fourth you integrate all your resources supply side and demand side 24 the combination of diversifying variable renewables by type and location forecasting their variation and integrating them with despatchable renewables flexible fueled generators and demand response can create a power system that has the potential to meet our needs reliably integrating ever-higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world 3 variability and reliabilityedit mark a delucchi and mark z jacobson identify seven ways to design and operate variable renewable energy systems so that they will reliably satisfy electricity demand 25 a interconnect geographically dispersed naturally variable energy sources eg wind solar wave tidal which smoothes out electricity supply and demand significantly b use complementary and non-variable energy sources such as hydroelectric power to fill temporary gaps between demand and wind or solar generation c use smart demand-response management to shift flexible loads to a time when more renewable energy is available d store electric power at the site of generation in batteries hydrogen gas molten salts compressed air pumped hydroelectric power and flywheels for later use e over-size renewable peak generation capacity to minimize the times when available renewable power is less than demand and to provide spare power to produce hydrogen for flexible transportation and heat uses f store electric power in electric-vehicle batteries known as vehicle to grid or v2g g forecast the weather winds sunlight waves tides and precipitation to better plan for energy supply needs 25 jacobson and delucchi say that wind water and solar power can be scaled up in cost-effective ways to meet our energy demands freeing us from dependence on both fossil fuels and nuclear power in 2009 they published a plan to power 100 percent of the planet with renewables in scientific american a more detailed and updated technical analysis has been published as a two-part article in the refereed journal energy policy 26 renewable energy is naturally replenished and renewable power technologies increase energy security because they reduce dependence on foreign sources of fuel unlike power stations relying on uranium and recycled plutonium for fuel they are not subject to the volatility of global fuel markets 27 renewable power decentralises electricity supply and so minimises the need to produce transport and store hazardous fuels reliability of power generation is improved by producing power close to the energy consumer an accidental or intentional outage affects a smaller amount of capacity than an outage at a larger power station 27 future prospectsedit the international energy agency says that there has been too much attention on issue of the variability of renewable electricity production 2 the issue of intermittent supply applies to popular renewable technologies mainly wind power and solar photovoltaics and its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned the balance of plant and the wider connectivity of the system as well as the demand side flexibility variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment when dispatchable generation is also available but at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management and additional costs may be required for back-up or system modification 2 renewable electricity supply in the 20-50 penetration range has already been implemented in several european systems albeit in the context of an integrated european grid system 3 in 2011 the intergovernmental panel on climate change the worlds leading climate researchers selected by the united nations said as infrastructure and energy systems develop in spite of the complexities there are few if any fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied 28 ipcc scenarios generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world 29 the ipcc said that if governments were supportive and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed renewable energy supply could account for almost 80 of the worlds energy use within forty years 30 rajendra pachauri chairman of the ipcc said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1 of global gdp annually this approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible 30 see alsoedit energy portal intermittent energy source energy security and renewable technology list of energy storage
