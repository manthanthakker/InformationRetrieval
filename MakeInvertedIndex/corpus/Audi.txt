italdesign giugiaro lamborghini quattro gmbh audi ag 1 pronounced ˈʔaʊdɪ ʔaːˈgeː listen is a german automobile manufacturer that designs engineers produces markets and distributes luxury vehicles audi oversees worldwide operations from its headquarters in ingolstadt bavaria germany audi-branded vehicles are produced in nine production facilities worldwide the origins of the company are complex going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises horch and the audiwerke founded by engineer august horch and two other manufacturers dkw and wanderer leading to the foundation of auto union in 1932 the modern era of audi essentially began in the 1960s when auto union was acquired by volkswagen from daimler-benz 9 after relaunching the audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the audi f103 series volkswagen merged auto union with nsu motorenwerke in 1969 thus creating the present day form of the company the company name is based on the latin translation of the surname of the founder august horch horch meaning listen in german becomes audi in latin the four rings of the audi logo each represent one of four car companies that banded together to create audis predecessor company auto union audis slogan is vorsprung durch technik meaning advancement through technology however since 2007 audi usa has used the slogan truth in engineering 10 audi is among the best-selling

established later becoming a branch of audi ag another company nsu which also later merged into audi was founded during this time and later supplied the chassis for gottlieb daimlers four-wheeler 12 on 14 november 1899 august horch  1868–1951 established the company a horch  cie in the ehrenfeld district of cologne three years later in 1902 he moved with his company to reichenbach im vogtland on may 10th 1904 he founded the august horch  cie motorwagenwerke ag a joint-stock company in zwickau state of saxony after troubles with horch chief financial officer august horch left motorwagenwerke and founded in zwickau on 16 july 1909 his second company the august horch automobilwerke gmbh his former partners sued him for trademark infringement the german reichsgericht supreme court in leipzig 13 eventually determined that the horch brand belonged to his former company 14 since august horch was banned from using horch as a trade name in his new car business he called a meeting with close business friends paul and franz fikentscher from zwickau germany at the apartment of franz fikentscher they discussed how to come up with a new name for the company during this meeting franzs son was quietly studying latin in a corner of the room several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working until he finally blurted out father audiatur et altera parswouldnt it be a good idea to call it audi instead of horch 15 horch in german means hark or hear which is audi in the singular imperative form of audire  to listen  in latin the idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting 16 on 25 april 1910 the audi automobilwerke gmbh zwickau from 1915 on audiwerke ag zwickau was entered in the companys register of zwickau registration court the first audi automobile the audi type a 10/22hp  16kw sport-phaeton was produced in the same year 17 followed by the successor type b 10/28ps in the same year 18 audi started with a 2,612cc inline-four engine model type a followed by a 3,564cc model as well as 4,680cc and 5,720cc models these cars were successful even in sporting events the first six-cylinder model type m 4,655cc appeared in 1924 19 august horch left the audiwerke in 1920 for a high position at the ministry of transport but he was still involved with audi as a member of the board of trustees in september 1921 audi became the first german car manufacturer to present a production car the audi type k with left-handed drive 20 left-hand drive spread and established dominance during the 1920s because it provided a better view of oncoming traffic making overtaking safer 20 the merger of the four companies under the logo of four rings in august 1928 jørgen rasmussen the owner of dampf-kraft-wagen dkw acquired the majority of shares in audiwerke ag 21 in the same year rasmussen bought the remains of the us automobile manufacturer rickenbacker including the manufacturing equipment for eight-cylinder engines these engines were used in audi zwickau and audi dresden models that were launched in 1929 at the same time six-cylinder and four-cylinder the four with a peugeot engine models were manufactured audi cars of that era were luxurious cars equipped with special bodywork in 1932 audi merged with horch dkw and wanderer to form auto union ag chemnitz it was during this period that the company offered the audi front that became the first european car to combine a six-cylinder engine with front-wheel drive it used a powertrain shared with the wanderer but turned 180-degrees so that the drive shaft faced the front before world war ii auto union used the four interlinked rings that make up the audi badge today representing these four brands this badge was used however only on auto union racing cars in that period while the member companies used their own names and emblems the technological development became more and more concentrated and some audi models were propelled by horch or wanderer built engines reflecting the economic pressures of the time auto union concentrated increasingly on smaller cars through the 1930s so that by 1938 the companys dkw brand accounted for 17.9 of the german car market while audi held only 0.1 after the final few audis were delivered in 1939 the audi name disappeared completely from the new car market for more than two decades post-world war ii like most german manufacturing at the onset of world war ii the auto union plants were retooled for military production and were a target for allied bombing during the war which left them damaged overrun by the soviet army in 1945 on the orders of the soviet union military administration the factories were dismantled as part of war reparations 22 following this the companys entire assets were expropriated without compensation 22 on 17 august 1948 auto union ag of chemnitz was deleted from the commercial register 21 these actions had the effect of liquidating germanys auto union ag the remains of the audi plant of zwickau became the veb for people owned enterprise automobilwerk zwickau or awz in english automobile works zwickau with no prospect of continuing production in soviet controlled east germany auto union executives began the process of relocating what was left of the company to west germany a site was chosen in ingolstadt bavaria to start a spare parts operation in late 1945 which would eventually serve as the headquarters of the reformed auto union in 1949 the former audi factory in zwickau restarted assembly of the pre-war-models in 1949 these dkw models were renamed to ifa f8 and ifa f9 and were similar to the west german versions west and east german models were equipped with the traditional and renowned dkw two-stroke engines the zwickau plant manufactured the infamous trabant until 1991 when it came under volkswagen controleffectively bringing it under the same umbrella as audi since 1945 new auto union unit a new west german headquartered auto union was launched in ingolstadt bavaria with loans from the bavarian state government and marshall plan aid 22 the reformed company was launched 3 september 1949 and continued dkws tradition of producing front-wheel drive vehicles with two-stroke engines 22 this included production of a small but sturdy 125cc motorcycle and a dkw delivery van the dkw f89 l at ingolstadt the ingolstadt site was large consisting of an extensive complex of formerly military buildings which was suitable for administration as well as vehicle warehousing and distribution but at this stage there was at ingolstadt no dedicated plant suitable for mass production of automobiles for manufacturing the companys first post-war mass-market passenger car plant capacity in düsseldorf was rented from rheinmetall-borsig it was only ten years later after the company had attracted an investor that funds became available for construction of major car plant at the ingolstadt head office site in 1958 in response to pressure from friedrich flick then their largest single shareholder 23 daimler-benz took an 87 holding in the auto union company and this was increased to a 100 holding in 1959 however small two-stroke cars were not the focus of daimler-benzs interests and while the early 1960s saw major investment in new mercedes models and in a state of the art factory for auto unions the companys aging model range at this time did not benefit from the economic boom of the early 1960s to the same extent as competitor manufacturers such as volkswagen and opel the decision to dispose of the auto union business was based on its lack of profitability 24 ironically by the time they sold the business it also included a large new factory and near production-ready modern four-stroke engine which would enable the auto union business under a new owner to embark on a period of profitable growth now producing not auto unions or dkws but using the audi name resurrected in 1965 after a 25-year gap in 1964 volkswagen acquired a 50 holding in the business which included the new factory in ingolstadt the dkw and audi brands along with the rights to the new engine design which had been funded by daimler-benz who in return retained the dormant horch trademark and the düsseldorf factory which became a mercedes-benz van assembly plant eighteen months later volkswagen bought complete control of ingolstadt and by 1966 were using the spare capacity of the ingolstadt plant to assemble an additional 60,000 volkswagen beetles per year 25 two-stroke engines became less popular during the 1960s as customers were more attracted to the smoother four-stroke engines in september 1965 the dkw f102 was fitted with a four-stroke engine and a facelift for the cars front and rear volkswagen dumped the dkw brand because of its associations with two-stroke technology and having classified the model internally as the f103 sold it simply as the audi later developments of the model were named after their horsepower ratings and sold as the audi 60 75 80 and super 90 selling until 1972 initially volkswagen was hostile to the idea of auto union as a standalone entity producing its own models having acquired the company merely to boost its own production capacity through the ingolstadt assembly plant - to the point where volkswagen executives ordered that the auto union name and flags bearing the four rings were removed from the factory buildings then vw chief heinz nordhoff explicitly forbade auto union from any further product development fearing that the volkswagen had no long term ambition for the audi brand auto union engineers under the leadership of ludwig kraus developed the first audi 100 in secret without nordhoffs knowledge when presented with a finished prototype nordhoff was so impressed he authorised the car for production which when launched in 1968 went on to be a huge success with this the resurrection of the audi brand was now complete this being followed by the first generation audi 80 in 1972 which would in turn provide a template for vws new front-wheel-drive water-cooled range which debuted from the mid-1970s onward in 1969 auto union merged with nsu based in neckarsulm near stuttgart in the 1950s nsu had been the worlds largest manufacturer of motorcycles but had moved on to produce small cars like the nsu prinz the tt and tts versions of which are still popular as vintage race cars nsu then focused on new rotary engines based on the ideas of felix wankel in 1967 the new nsu ro 80 was a car well ahead of its time in technical details such as aerodynamics light weight and safety however teething problems with the rotary engines put an end to the independence of nsu the neckarsulm plant is now used to produce the larger audi models a6 and a8 the neckarsulm factory is also home of the quattro gmbh a subsidiary responsible for development and production of audi high-performance models the r8 and the rs model range modern era the new merged company was incorporated on 1 january 1969 and was known as audi nsu auto union ag with its headquarters based at nsus neckarsulm plant and saw the emergence of audi as a separate brand for the first time since the pre-war era volkswagen introduced the audi brand to the united states for the 1970 model year that same year the mid-sized car that nsu had been working on the k70 originally intended to slot between the rear-engined prinz models and the futuristic nsu ro 80 was instead launched as a volkswagen after the launch of the audi 100 of 1968 the audi 80fox which formed the basis for the 1973 volkswagen passat followed in 1972 and the audi 50 later rebadged as the volkswagen polo in 1974 the audi 50 was a seminal design because it was the first incarnation of the golfpolo concept one that led to a hugely successful world car ultimately the audi 80 and 100 progenitors of the a4 and a6 respectively became the companys biggest sellers whilst little investment was made in the fading nsu range the prinz models were dropped in 1973 whilst the fatally flawed nsu ro80 went out of production in 1977 spelling the effective end of the nsu brand production of the audi 100 had been steadily moved from ingolstadt to neckarsulm as the 1970s had progressed any by the appearance of the second generation c2 version in 1976 all production was now at the former nsu plant neckarsulm from that point onward would produce audis higher end models the audi image at this time was a conservative one and so a proposal from chassis engineer jörg bensinger 26 was accepted to develop the four-wheel drive technology in volkswagens iltis military vehicle for an audi performance car and rally racing car the performance car introduced in 1980 was named the audi quattro a turbocharged coupé which was also the first german large-scale production vehicle to feature permanent all-wheel drive through a centre differential commonly referred to as the ur-quattro the ur- prefix is a german augmentative used in this case to mean original and is also applied to the first generation of audis s4 and s6 sport saloons as in urs4 and urs6 few of these vehicles were produced all hand-built by a single team but the model was a great success in rallying prominent wins proved the viability of all-wheel drive racecars and the audi name became associated with advances in automotive technology in 1985 with the auto union and nsu brands effectively dead the companys official name was now shortened to simply audi ag at the same time the companys headquarters moved back to ingolstadt and two new wholly owned subsidiaries auto union gmbh and nsu gmbh were formed to own and manage the historical trademarks and intellectual property of the original constituent companies the exception being horch which had been retained by daimler-benz after the vw takeover and to operate audis heritage operations in 1986 as the passat-based audi 80 was beginning to develop a kind of grandfathers car image the type 89 was introduced this completely new development sold extremely well however its modern and dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine and its base package was quite spartan even the passenger-side mirror was an option in 1987 audi put forward a new and very elegant audi 90 which had a much superior set of standard features in the early 1990s sales began to slump for the audi 80 series and some basic construction problems started to surface in the early part of the 21st century audi set forth on a german racetrack to claim and maintain several world records such as top speed endurance this effort was in-line with the companys heritage from the 1930s racing era silver arrows through the early 1990s audi began to shift its target market upscale to compete against german automakers mercedes-benz and bmw this began with the release of the audi v8 in 1990 it was essentially a new engine fitted to the audi 100/200 but with noticeable bodywork differences most obvious was the new grille that was now incorporated in the bonnet by 1991 audi had the four-cylinder audi 80 the 5-cylinder audi 90 and audi 100 the turbocharged audi 200 and the audi v8 there was also a coupe version of the 80/90 with both 4- and 5-cylinder engines although the five-cylinder engine was a successful and robust powerplant it was still a little too different for the target market with the introduction of an all-new audi 100 in 1992 audi introduced a 2.8l v6 engine this engine was also fitted to a face-lifted audi 80 all 80 and 90 models were now badged 80 except for the usa giving this model a choice of four- five- and six-cylinder engines in saloon coupé and cabriolet body styles the five-cylinder was soon dropped as a major engine choice however a turbocharged 230hp  170kw version remained the engine initially fitted to the 200 quattro 20v of 1991 was a derivative of the engine fitted to the sport quattro it was fitted to the audi coupé and named the s2 and also to the audi 100 body and named the s4 these two models were the beginning of the mass-produced s series of performance cars audi 5000 unintended acceleration allegations sales in the united states fell after a series of recalls from 1982 to 1987 of audi 5000 models 27 associated with reported incidents of sudden unintended acceleration linked to six deaths and 700 accidents 27 at the time nhtsa was investigating 50 car models from 20 manufacturers for sudden surges of power 28 a 60 minutes report aired 23 november 1986 29 featuring interviews with six people who had sued audi after reporting unintended acceleration showing an audi 5000 ostensibly suffering a problem when the brake pedal was pushed 30 31 subsequent investigation revealed that 60 minutes had engineered the failure  fitting a canister of compressed air on the passenger-side floor linked via a hose to a hole drilled into the transmission 29 audi contended prior to findings by outside investigators 28 that the problems were caused by driver error specifically pedal misapplication 28 subsequently the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa concluded that the majority of unintended acceleration cases including all the ones that prompted the 60 minutes report were caused by driver error such as confusion of pedals 32 cbs did not acknowledge the test results of involved government agencies but did acknowledge the similar results of another study 30 in a review study published in 2012 nhtsa summarized its past findings about the audi unintended acceleration problems once an unintended acceleration had begun in the audi 5000 due to a failure in the idle-stabilizer system producing an initial acceleration of 0.3g pedal misapplication resulting from panic confusion or unfamiliarity with the audi 5000 contributed to the severity of the incident 33 this summary is consistent with the conclusions of nhtsas most technical analysis at the time audi idle-stabilization systems were prone to defects which resulted in excessive idle speeds and brief unanticipated accelerations of up to 0.3g which is similar in magnitude to an emergency stop in a subway car these accelerations could not be the sole cause of long-duration sudden acceleration incidents sai but might have triggered some sais by startling the driver 34 the defective idle-stabilization system performed a type of electronic throttle control significantly multiple intermittent malfunctions of the electronic control unit were observed and recorded  and were also observed and reported by transport canada 34 with a series of recall campaigns audi made several modifications the first adjusted the distance between the brake and accelerator pedal on automatic-transmission models 27 later repairs of 250,000 cars dating back to 1978 added a device requiring the driver to press the brake pedal before shifting out of park 27 a legacy of the audi 5000 and other reported cases of sudden unintended acceleration are intricate gear stick patterns and brake interlock mechanisms to prevent inadvertent shifting into forward or reverse it is unclear how the defects in the idle-stabilization system were addressed audis us sales which had reached 74,061 in 1985 dropped to 12,283 in 1991 and remained level for three years 27  with resale values falling dramatically 35 audi subsequently offered increased warranty protection 35 and renamed the affected models  with the 5000 becoming the 100 and 200 in 1989 28  and only reached the same sales levels again by model year 2000 27 a 2010 businessweek article  outlining possible parallels between audis experience and 2009–2010 toyota vehicle recalls  noted a class-action lawsuit filed in 1987 by about 7,500 audi 5000-model owners remains unsettled and is currently being contested in county court in chicago after appeals at the illinois state and us federal levels 27 model introductions in the mid-to-late 1990s audi introduced new technologies including the use of aluminum construction produced from 1999 to 2005 the audi a2 was a futuristic super mini born from the al2 concept with many features that helped regain consumer confidence like the aluminium space frame which was a first in production car design in the a2 audi further expanded their tdi technology through the use of frugal three-cylinder engines the a2 was extremely aerodynamic and was designed around a wind tunnel the audi a2 was criticised for its high price and was never really a sales success but it planted audi as a cutting-edge manufacturer the model a mercedes-benz a-class competitor sold relatively well in europe however the a2 was discontinued in 2005 and audi decided not to develop an immediate replacement the next major model change came in 1995 when the audi a4 replaced the audi 80 the new nomenclature scheme was applied to the audi 100 to become the audi a6 with a minor facelift this also meant the s4 became the s6 and a new s4 was introduced in the a4 body the s2 was discontinued the audi cabriolet continued on based on the audi 80 platform until 1999 gaining the engine upgrades along the way a new a3 hatchback model sharing the volkswagen golf mk4s platform was introduced to the range in 1996 and the radical audi tt coupé and roadster were debuted in 1998 based on the same underpinnings the engines available throughout the range were now a 1.4l 1.6l and 1.8l four-cylinder 1.8l four-cylinder turbo 2.6l and 2.8l v6 2.2l turbo-charged five-cylinder and the 4.2l v8 engine the v6s were replaced by new 2.4l and 2.8l 30v v6s in 1998 with marked improvement in power torque and smoothness further engines were added along the way including a 3.7l v8 and 6.0l w12 engine for the a8 audi ag today audis sales grew strongly in the 2000s with deliveries to customers increasing from 653,000 in 2000 to 1,003,000 in 2008 the largest sales increases came from eastern europe +19.3 africa +17.2 and the middle east +58.5 china in particular has become a key market representing 108,000 out of 705,000 cars delivered in the first three quarters of 2009 one factor for its popularity in china is that audis have become the car of choice for purchase by the chinese government for officials and purchases by the government are responsible for 20 of its sales in china 36 as of late 2009 audis operating profit of €1.17-billion $1.85-billion made it the biggest contributor to parent volkswagen groups nine-month operating profit of €1.5-billion while the other marques in group such as bentley and seat had suffered considerable losses 37 may 2011 saw record sales for audi of america with the new audi a7 and audi a3 tdi clean diesel 38 in may 2012 audi reported a 10 increase in its salesfrom 408 units to 480 in the last year alone 39 audi manufactures vehicles in seven plants around the world some of which are shared with other vw group marques 40 although many sub-assemblies such as engines and transmissions are manufactured within other volkswagen group plants audis two principal assembly plants are ingolstadt opened by auto union in 1964 a3 a4 a5 q5 neckarsulm acquired from nsu in 1969 a4 a6 a7 a8 r8  all rs variants outside of germany audi produces vehicles at aurangabad india since 2006 bratislava slovakia shared with volkswagen seat škoda and porsche q7 brussels belgium acquired from volkswagen in 2007 a1 changchun china since 1995 győr hungary tt and some a3 variants jakarta indonesia since 2011 martorell spain shared with seat and volkswagen q3 san josé chiapa mexico q5 in september 2012 audi announced the construction of its first north american manufacturing plant in puebla mexico this plant is expected to be operative in 2016 and produce the second generation q5 41 from 2002 up to 2003 audi headed the audi brand group a subdivision of the volkswagen groups automotive division consisting of audi lamborghini and seat that was focused on sporty values with the marques product vehicles and performance being under the higher responsibility of the audi brand in 2014 most of the audi dealers in uk falsely claimed that the audi a7 a8 and r8 were euro ncap safety tested all achieving five out of five stars in fact none were tested 42 in 2015 audi admitted that at least 2.1 million audi cars had been involved in the volkswagen emissions testing scandal in which software installed in the cars manipulated emissions data to fool regulators and allow the cars to pollute at higher than government-mandated levels the a1 a3 a4 a5 a6 tt q3 and q5 models were implicated in the scandal 43 audi promised to quickly find a technical solution and upgrade the cars so they can function within emissions regulations 44 ulrich hackenberg the head of research and development at audi was suspended in relation to the scandal 45 despite widespread media coverage about the scandal through the month of september audi reported that us sales for the month had increased by 16.2 46 in november 2015 the us environmental protection agency implicated the 3-liter diesel engine versions of the 2016 audi a6 quattro a7 quattro a8 a8l and the q5 as further models that had emissions regulation defeat-device software installed 47 thus these models emitted nitrogen oxide at up to nine times the legal limit when the car detected that it was not hooked up to emissions testing equipment 48 technology bodyshells audi produces 100 galvanised cars to prevent corrosion 49 and was the first mass-market vehicle to do so following introduction of the process by porsche c 1975 along with other precautionary measures the full-body zinc coating has proved to be very effective in preventing rust the bodys resulting durability even surpassed audis own expectations causing the manufacturer to extend its original 10-year warranty against corrosion perforation to currently 12 years except for aluminium bodies which do not rust 50 space frame audi introduced a new series of vehicles in the mid-1990s and continues to pursue new technology and high performance an all-aluminium car was brought forward by audi and in 1994 the audi a8 was launched which introduced aluminium space frame technology called audi space frame or asf which saves weight and improves torsion rigidity compared to a conventional steel frame prior to that effort audi used examples of the type 44 chassis fabricated out of aluminium as test-beds for the technique the disadvantage of the aluminium frame is that it is very expensive to repair and requires a specialized aluminium bodyshop 51 the weight reduction is somewhat offset by the quattro four-wheel drive system which is standard in most markets nonetheless the a8 is usually the lightest all-wheel drive car in the full-size luxury segment also having best-in-class fuel economy 52 the audi a2 audi tt and audi r8 also use audi space frame designs drivetrains layout for most of its lineup excluding the a3 a1 and tt models audi has not adopted the transverse engine layout which is typically found in economy cars such as peugeot and citroën since that would limit the type and power of engines that can be installed to be able to mount powerful engines such as a v8 engine in the audi s4 and audi rs4 as well as the w12 engine in the audi a8l w12 audi has usually engineered its more expensive cars with a longitudinally front-mounted engine in an overhung position over the front wheels in front of the axle line - this layout dates back to the dkw and auto union saloons from the 1950s but while this allows for the easy adoption of all-wheel drive it goes against the ideal 50:50 weight distribution in all its post volkswagen-era models audi has firmly refused to adopt the traditional rear-wheel drive layout favored by its two archrivals mercedes-benz and bmw favoring either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive the majority of audis lineup in the united states features all-wheel drive standard on most of its expensive vehicles only the entry-level trims of the a4 and a6 are available with front-wheel drive in contrast to mercedes-benz and bmw whose lineup treats all-wheel drive as an option bmw did not offer all-wheel drive on its v8-powered cars as opposed to crossover suvs until the 2010 bmw 7 series and 2011 bmw 5 series while the audi a8 has had all-wheel drive availablestandard since the 1990s regarding high-performance variants audi s and rs models have always had all-wheel drive unlike their direct rivals from bmw m and mercedes-amg whose cars are rear-wheel drive only although their performance crossover suvs are all-wheel drive audi has recently applied the quattro badge to models such as the a3 and tt which do not use the torsen-based system as in prior years with a mechanical center differential but with the haldex traction electro-mechanical clutch awd system engines prior to the introduction of the audi 80 and audi 50 in 1972 and 1974 respectively audi had led the development of the ea111 and ea827 inline-four engine families these new power units underpinned the water-cooled revival of parent company volkswagen in the polo golf passat and scirocco whilst the many derivatives and descendants of these two basic engine designs have appeared in every generation of vw group vehicles right up to the present day in the 1980s audi along with volvo was the champion of the inline-five cylinder 2.1/2.2 l engine as a longer-lasting alternative to more traditional six-cylinder engines this engine was used not only in production cars but also in their race cars the 2.1l inline five-cylinder engine was used as a base for the rally cars in the 1980s providing well over 400 horsepower  300 kilowatts after modification before 1990 there were engines produced with a displacement between 2.0l and 2.3l this range of engine capacity allowed for both fuel economy and power for the ultra-luxury version of its audi a8 fullsize luxury flagship sedan the audi a8l w12 audi uses the volkswagen group w12 engine instead of the conventional v12 engine favored by rivals mercedes-benz and bmw the w12 engine configuration also known as a wr12 is created by forming two imaginary narrow-angle 15 vr6 engines at an angle of 72 and the narrow angle of each set of cylinders allows just two overhead camshafts to drive each pair of banks so just four are needed in total 53 the advantage of the w12 engine is its compact packaging allowing audi to build a 12-cylinder sedan with all-wheel drive whereas a conventional v12 engine could only have a rear-wheel drive configuration as it would have no space in the engine bay for a differential and other components required to power the front wheels in fact the 6.0l w12 in the audi a8l w12 is smaller in overall dimensions than the 4.2l v8 that powers the audi a8 4.2 variants 54 the 2011 audi a8 debuted a revised 6.3-litre version of the w12 wr12 engine with 500ps  370kw 490hp fuel stratified injection new models of the a3 a4 a6 and a8 have been introduced with the ageing 1.8-litre engine now having been replaced by new fuel stratified injection fsi engines nearly every petroleum burning model in the range now incorporates this fuel-saving technology direct-shift gearbox at the turn of the century volkswagen introduced the direct-shift gearbox dsg a type of dual clutch transmission it is an automated semi-automatic transmission drivable like a conventional automatic transmission based on the gearbox found in the group b s1 the system includes dual electrohydraulically controlled clutches instead of a torque converter this is implemented in some vw golfs audi a3 audi a4 and tt models where dsg is called s-tronic led daytime running lights beginning in 2005 audi has implemented white led technology as daytime running lights drl in their products the distinctive shape of the drls has become a trademark of sorts leds were first introduced on the audi a8 w12 the worlds first production car to have led drls 55 56 57 and have since spread throughout the entire model range the leds are present on some audi billboards since 2010 audi has also offered the led technology in low- and high-beam headlights 58 multi media interface starting with the 2003 audi a8 audi has used a centralised control interface for its on-board infotainment systems called multi media interface mmi this came amid criticism of bmws idrive control it is essentially a rotating control knob and segment buttons  designed to control all in-car entertainment devices radio cd changer ipod tv tuner satellite navigation heating and ventilation and other car controls with a screen mmi was widely reported to be a considerable improvement on bmws idrive although bmw has since made their idrive more user-friendly the availability of mmi has gradually filtered down the audi lineup and following its introduction on the third generation a3 in 2011 mmi is now available across the entire range it has been generally well received as it requires less menu-surfing with its segment buttons around a central knob along with main function direct access buttons  with shortcuts to the radio or phone functions the colour screen is mounted on the upright dashboard and on the a4 new a5 a6 a8 and q7 the controls are mounted horizontally synthetic diesel audi has come out with technology to produce synthetic diesel from water and carbon dioxide 59 models current model range the following tables list audi

overall figures for each model motorsport audi has competed in various forms of motorsports audis tradition in motorsport began with their former company auto union in the 1930s in the 1990s audi found success in the touring and super touring categories of motor racing after success in circuit racing in north america rallying in 1980 audi released the quattro a four-wheel drive  4wd turbocharged car that went on to win rallies and races worldwide it is considered one of the most significant rally cars of all time because it was one of the first to take advantage of the then-recently changed rules which allowed the use of four-wheel drive in competition racing many critics doubted the viability of four-wheel drive racers thinking them to be too heavy and complex yet the quattro was to become a successful car leading its first rally it went off the road however the rally world had been served notice 4wd was the future the quattro went on to achieve much success in the world rally championship it won the 1983 hannu mikkola and the 1984 stig blomqvist drivers titles 81 and brought audi the manufacturers title in 1982 and 1984 82 in 1984 audi launched the short-wheelbase sport quattro which dominated rally races in monte carlo and sweden with audi taking all podium places but succumbed to problems further into wrc contention in 1985 after another season mired in mediocre finishes walter röhrl finished the season in his sport quattro s1 and helped place audi second in the manufacturers points audi also received rally honours in the hong kong to beijing rally in that same year michèle mouton the only female driver to win a round of the world rally championship and a driver for audi took the sport quattro s1 now simply called the s1 and raced in the pikes peak international hill climb the 1,439-metre  4,721ft climb race pits a driver and car to drive to the summit of the 4,302-metre  14,114ft pikes peak mountain in colorado and in 1985 michèle mouton set a new record of 11:25.39 and being the first woman to set a pikes peak record in 1986 audi formally left international rally racing following an accident in portugal involving driver joaquim santos in his ford rs200 santos swerved to avoid hitting spectators in the road and left the track into the crowd of spectators on the side killing three and injuring 30 bobby unser used an audi in that same year to claim a new record for the pikes peak hill climb at 11:09.22 in 1987 walter röhrl claimed the title for audi setting a new pikes peak international hill climb record of 10:47.85 in his audi s1 which he had retired from the wrc two years earlier the audi s1 employed audis time-tested inline-five-cylinder turbocharged engine with the final version generating 441kw  600ps 591bhp 83 the engine was mated to a six-speed gearbox and ran on audis famous four-wheel drive system all of audis top drivers drove this car hannu mikkola stig blomqvist walter röhrl and michèle mouton this audi s1 started the range of audi s cars which now represents an increased level of sports-performance equipment within the mainstream audi model range in the usa as audi moved away from rallying and into circuit racing they chose to move first into america with the trans-am in 1988 in 1989 audi moved to international motor sports association imsa gto with the audi 90 however as they avoided the two major endurance events daytona and sebring despite winning on a regular basis they would lose out on the title touring cars in 1990 having completed their objective to market cars in north america audi returned to europe turning first to the deutsche tourenwagen meisterschaft dtm series with the audi v8 and then in 1993 being unwilling to build cars for the new formula they turned their attention to the fast-growing super touring series which are a series of national championships audi first entered in the french supertourisme and italian superturismo in the following year audi would switch to the german super tourenwagen cup known as stw and then to british touring car championship btcc the year after that the fédération internationale de lautomobile fia having difficulty regulating the quattro four-wheel drive system and the impact it had on the competitors would eventually ban all four-wheel drive cars from competing in 1998 84 but by then audi switched all their works efforts to sports car racing by 2000 audi would still compete in the us with their rs4 for the scca speed world gt challenge through dealerteam champion racing competing against corvettes vipers and smaller bmws where it is one of the few series to permit 4wd cars in 2003 champion racing entered an rs6 once again the quattro four-wheel drive was superior and champion audi won the championship they returned in 2004 to defend their title but a newcomer cadillac with the new omega chassis cts-v gave them a run for their money after four victories in a row the audis were sanctioned with several negative changes that deeply affected the cars performance namely added ballast weights and champion audi deciding to go with different tyres and reducing the boost pressure of the turbocharger in 2004 after years of competing with the tt-r in the revitalised dtm series with privateer team abt racingchristian abt taking the 2002 title with laurent aïello audi

mans 24 hour two car concepts were developed and raced in their first season - the audi r8r open-cockpit roadster prototype and the audi r8c closed-cockpit coupé gt-prototype the r8r scored a credible podium on its racing debut at le mans and was the concept which audi continued to develop into the 2000 season due to favourable rules for open-cockpit prototypes however most of the competitors such as bmw toyota mercedes and nissan retired at the end of 1999 the factory-supported joest racing team won at le mans three times in a row with the audi r8  2000–2002 as well as winning every race in

2005 24 hours of le mans champion racing entered two r8s along with an r8 from the audi playstation team oreca the r8s which were built to old lmp900 regulations received a narrower air inlet restrictor reducing power and an additional 50kg  110lb of weight compared to the newer lmp1 chassis on average the r8s were about 2–3seconds off pace compared to the pescarolojudd but with a team of excellent drivers and experience both champion r8s were able to take first and third while the oreca team took fourth the champion team was also the first american team to win le mans since the gulf ford gts in 1967 this also ends the long era of the r8 however its replacement for 2006 called the audi r10 tdi was unveiled on 13 december 2005 the r10 tdi employed many new and innovative features the most notable being the twin-turbocharged direct injection diesel engine it was first raced in the 2006 12 hours of sebring as a race-test in preparation for the 2006 24 hours of le mans which it later went on to win audi has been on the forefront of sports car racing claiming a historic win in the first diesel sports car at 12 hours of sebring the car was developed with a diesel engine due to aco regulations that favor diesel engines as well as winning the 24 hours of le mans in 2006 making history the r10 tdi has also shown its capabilities by beating the peugeot 908 hdi fap in 2007 and beating peugeot again in 2008 however peugeot won the 24h in 2009 and in a podium clean-sweep by proving its reliability throughout the race compared to all four 908 entries retired before the end of

seconds results american le mans series audi entered a factory racing team run by joest racing into the american le mans series under the audi sport north america name in 2000 this was a successful operation with the team winning on its debut in the series at the 2000 12 hours of sebring factory backed audi r8s were the dominant car in alms taking 25 victories between 2000 and the end of the 2002 season in 2003 audi sold customer cars to champion racing as well as continuing to race the factory audi sport north america team champion racing won many races as a private team running audi r8s

the 2003 1000km of le mans which was a one-off sports car race in preparation for the 2004 european le mans series the factory team audi sport uk won races and the championship in the 2004 season but audi was unable to match their sweeping success of audi sport north america in the american le mans series partly due to the arrival of a factory competitor in lmp1 peugeot the french manufacturers 908 hdi fap became the car to beat in the series from 2008 onwards with 20 lmp wins however audi were able to secure the championship in 2008 even though peugeot scored more race victories in the

grassi 91 formula one audi has been linked to formula one in recent years but has always resisted due to the companys opinion that it is not relevant to road cars but hybrid power unit technology has been adopted into the sport swaying the companys view and encouraging research into the program by former ferrari team principal stefano domenicali marketing branding the audi emblem is four overlapping rings that represent the four marques of auto union the audi emblem symbolises the amalgamation of audi with dkw horch and wanderer the first ring from the left represents audi the second represents dkw third is horch and the fourth and last ring wanderer 92 93 the design is popularly believed to have been the idea of klaus von oertzen the director of sales at wanderer - when berlin was chosen as the host city for the 1936 summer olympics and that a form of the olympic logo symbolized the newly established auto unions desire to succeed 94 somewhat ironically the international olympic committee later sued audi in the international trademark court in 1995 where they lost 95 the original audi script with the distinctive slanted tails on the a and d was created for the historic audi company in 1920 by the famous graphic designer lucian bernhard and was resurrected when volkswagen revived the brand in 1965 following the demise of nsu in 1977 less prominence was given to the four rings in preference to the audi script encased within a black later red ellipse and was commonly displayed next to the volkswagen roundel when the two brands shared a dealer network under the vag banner the ellipse known as the audi oval was phased out after 1994 when audi formed its own independent dealer network and prominence was given back to the four rings - at the same time audi sans a derivative of univers was adopted as the font for all marketing materials corporate communications and was also used in the vehicles themselves as part of audis centennial celebration in 2009 the company updated the logo changing the font to left-aligned audi type and altering the shading for the overlapping rings 96 the revised logo was designed by rayan abdullah 97 audi developed a corporate sound concept with audi sound studio designed for producing the corporate sound 98 the corporate sound project began with sound agency klangerfinder gmbh  co kg and s12 gmbh audio samples were created in klangerfinders sound studio in stuttgart becoming part of audi sound studio collection other audi sound studio components include the brand music pool the brand voice 99 audi also developed sound branding toolkit including certain instruments sound themes rhythm and car sounds which all are supposed to reflect the audi sound character 100 audi started using a beating heart sound trademark beginning in 1996 an updated heartbeat sound logo developed by agencies klangerfinder gmbh  co kg of stuttgart and s12 gmbh of munich was first used in 2010 in an audi a8 commercial with the slogan the art of progress 101 102 slogans audis corporate tagline is vorsprung durch technik meaning progress through technology 103 the german-language tagline is used in many european countries including the united kingdom and in other markets such as latin america oceania and parts of asia including japan a few years ago the north american tagline was innovation through technology but in canada the german tagline vorsprung durch technik was used in advertising since 2007 audi has used the slogan truth in engineering in the us 104 however since the audi emissions testing scandal came to light in september 2015 this slogan was lambasted for being discordant with reality 105 in fact just hours after disgraced volkswagen ceo martin winterkorn admitted to cheating on emissions data an advertisement during the 2015 primetime emmy awards promoted audis latest advances in low emissions technology with kermit the frog stating its not that easy being green 106 it was first used in english-language advertising after sir john hegarty of the bartle bogle hegarty advertising agency visited the audi factory in 1982 107 in the original british television commercials the phrase was voiced by geoffrey palmer 107 after its repeated use in advertising campaigns the phrase found its way into popular culture including the british comedy only fools and horses the u2 song zooropa 108 and the blur song parklife similar-sounding phrases have also been used including as the punchline for a joke in the movie lock stock and two smoking barrels and in the british tv series peep show typography audi sans based on univers extended was originally created in 1997 by ole schäfer for metadesign metadesign was later commissioned for a new corporate typeface called audi type designed by paul van der laan and pieter van rosmalen of bold monday the font began to appear in audis 2009 products and marketing materials 109 sponsorships audi is a strong partner of different kinds of sports
