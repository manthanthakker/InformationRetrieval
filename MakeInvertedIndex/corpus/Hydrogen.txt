hydrogen view talk edit hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbolh and atomic number 1 with an atomic weight of 7000100794000000000♠1.00794u hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table its monatomic form h is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe constituting roughly 75 of all baryonic mass 9note 1 non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state the most common isotope of hydrogen termed protium name rarely used symbol 1h has one proton and no neutrons the universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch at standard temperature and pressure hydrogen is a colorless odorless tasteless non-toxic nonmetallic highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula h2 since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements most of the hydrogen on earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acidbase reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules in ionic compounds hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge ie anion when it is known as a hydride or as a positively charged ie cation species denoted by the symbol h the hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton but in reality hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex as the only neutral atom for which the schrödinger equation can be solved analytically 10 study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals in 1766–81 henry cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance 11 and that it produces water when burned the property for which it was later named in greek hydrogen means water-former industrial production is mainly from steam reforming natural gas and less often from more energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water 12 most hydrogen is used near the site of its production site the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing eg hydrocracking and ammonia production mostly for the fertilizer market hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals 13 complicating the design of

very wide range of concentrations between 4 and 75 by volume 16 the enthalpy of combustion is −286kjmol 17 hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air in concentrations from 4–74 and with chlorine at 5–95 the explosive reactions may be triggered by spark heat or sunlight the hydrogen autoignition temperature the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air is 500c  932f 18 pure hydrogen-oxygen flames emit ultraviolet light and with high oxygen mix are nearly invisible to the naked eye as illustrated by the faint plume of the space shuttle main engine compared to the highly visible plume of a space shuttle solid rocket booster which uses an ammonium perchlorate composite the detection of a burning hydrogen leak may require a flame detector such leaks can be very dangerous hydrogen flames in other conditions are blue resembling blue natural gas flames 19 the destruction of the hindenburg airship was a notorious example of hydrogen combustion and the cause is still debated the visible orange flames in that incident were the result of a rich mixture of hydrogen to oxygen combined with carbon compounds from the airship skin h2 reacts with every oxidizing element hydrogen can react spontaneously and violently at room temperature with chlorine and fluorine to form the corresponding hydrogen halides hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride which are also potentially dangerous acids 20 electron energy levels the ground state energy level of the electron in a hydrogen atom is −13.6ev 21 which is equivalent to an ultraviolet photon of roughly 91nm wavelength 22 the energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the bohr model of the atom which conceptualizes the electron as orbiting the proton in analogy to the earths orbit of the sun however the atomic electron and proton are held together by electromagnetic force while planets and celestial objects are held by gravity because of the discretization of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by bohr the electron in the bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton and therefore only certain allowed energies 23 a more accurate description of the hydrogen atom comes from a purely quantum mechanical treatment that uses the schrödinger equation dirac equation or even the feynman path integral formulation to calculate the probability density of the electron around the proton 24 the most complicated treatments allow for the small effects of special relativity and vacuum polarization in the quantum mechanical treatment the electron in a ground state hydrogen atom has no angular momentum at allillustrating how the planetary orbit differs from electron motion elemental molecular forms there exist two different spin isomers of hydrogen diatomic molecules that differ by the relative spin of their nuclei 25 in the orthohydrogen form the spins of the two protons are parallel and form a triplet state with a molecular spin quantum number of 1  1⁄2 1⁄2 in the parahydrogen form the spins are antiparallel and form a singlet with a molecular spin quantum number of 0  1⁄2 1⁄2 at standard temperature and pressure hydrogen gas contains about 25 of the para form and 75 of the ortho form also known as the normal form 26 the equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen depends on temperature but because the ortho form is an excited state and has a higher energy than the para form it is unstable and cannot be purified at very low temperatures the equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of the para form the liquid and gas phase thermal properties of pure parahydrogen differ significantly from those of the normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities as discussed more fully in spin isomers of hydrogen 27 the orthopara distinction also occurs in other hydrogen-containing molecules or functional groups such as water and methylene but is of little significance for their thermal properties 28 the uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho h2 increases with increasing temperature thus rapidly condensed h2 contains large quantities of the high-energy ortho form that converts to the para form very slowly 29 the orthopara ratio in condensed h2 is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate some of the hydrogen liquid leading to loss of liquefied material catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion such as ferric oxide activated carbon platinized asbestos rare earth metals uranium compounds chromic oxide or some nickel 30 compounds are used during hydrogen cooling 31 phases gaseous hydrogen liquid hydrogen slush hydrogen solid hydrogen metallic hydrogen compounds covalent and organic compounds while h2 is not very reactive under standard conditions it does form compounds with most elements hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative such as halogens eg f cl br i or oxygen in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge 32 when bonded to fluorine oxygen or nitrogen hydrogen can participate in a form of medium-strength noncovalent bonding with the hydrogen of other similar molecules a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding that is critical to the stability of many biological molecules 33 34 hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements such as metals and metalloids where it takes on a partial negative charge these compounds are often known as hydrides 35 hydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with carbon called the hydrocarbons and an even vaster array with heteroatoms that because of their general association with living things are called organic compounds 36 the study of their properties is known as organic chemistry 37 and their study in the context of living organisms is known as biochemistry 38 by some definitions organic compounds are only required to contain carbon however most of them also contain hydrogen and because it is the carbon-hydrogen bond which gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics carbon-hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word organic in chemistry 36 millions of hydrocarbons are known and they are usually formed by complicated synthetic pathways that seldom involve elementary hydrogen hydrides compounds of hydrogen are often called hydrides a term that is used fairly loosely the term hydride suggests that the h atom has acquired a negative or anionic character denoted h and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more electropositive element the existence of the hydride anion suggested by gilbert n lewis in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt-like hydrides was demonstrated by moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten lithium hydride lih producing a stoichiometry quantity of hydrogen at the anode 39 for hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals the term is quite misleading considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen an exception in group 2 hydrides is beh 2 which is polymeric in lithium aluminium hydride the alh 4 anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the aliii although hydrides can be formed with almost all main-group elements the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely for example more than 100 binary borane hydrides are known but only one binary aluminium hydride 40 binary indium hydride has not yet been identified although larger complexes exist 41 in inorganic chemistry hydrides can also serve as bridging ligands that link two metal centers in a coordination complex this function is particularly common in group 13 elements especially in boranes boron hydrides and aluminium complexes as well as in clustered carboranes 42 protons and acids oxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives h which contains no electrons and a nucleus which is usually composed of one proton that is why h is often called a proton this species is central to discussion of acids under the bronsted-lowry theory acids are proton donors while bases are proton acceptors a bare proton h  cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons except at the high temperatures associated with plasmas such protons cannot be removed from the electron clouds of atoms and molecules and will remain attached to them however the term proton is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or cationic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion and as such is denoted h  without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species to avoid the implication of the naked solvated proton in solution acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species termed the hydronium ion h 3o  however even in this case such solvated hydrogen cations are more realistically conceived as being organized into clusters that form species closer to h 9o 4 43 other oxonium ions are found when water is in acidic solution with other solvents 44 although exotic on earth one of the most common ions in the universe is the h 3 ion known as protonated molecular hydrogen or the trihydrogen cation 45 isotopes hydrogen has three naturally occurring isotopes denoted 1 h 2 h and 3 h other highly unstable nuclei  4 h to 7 h have been synthesized in the laboratory but not observed in nature 46 47 1 h is the most common hydrogen isotope with an abundance of more than 99.98 because the nucleus of this isotope consists of only a single proton it is given the descriptive but rarely used formal name protium 48 2 h the other stable hydrogen isotope is known as deuterium and contains one proton and one neutron in the nucleus all deuterium in the universe is thought to have been produced at the time of the big bang and has endured since that time deuterium is not radioactive and does not represent a significant toxicity hazard water enriched in molecules that include deuterium instead of normal hydrogen is called heavy water deuterium and its compounds are used as a non-radioactive label in chemical experiments and in solvents for 1 h-nmr spectroscopy 49 heavy water is used as a neutron moderator and coolant for nuclear reactors deuterium is also a potential fuel for commercial nuclear fusion 50 3 h is known as tritium and contains one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus it is radioactive decaying into helium-3 through beta decay with a half-life of 12.32 years 42 it is so radioactive that it can be used in luminous paint making it useful in such things as watches the glass prevents the small amount of radiation from getting out 51 small amounts of tritium are produced naturally by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric gases tritium has also been released during nuclear weapons tests 52 it is used in nuclear fusion reactions 53 as a tracer in isotope geochemistry 54 and in specialized self-powered lighting devices 55 tritium has also been used in chemical and biological labeling experiments as a radiolabel 56 hydrogen is the only element that has different names for its isotopes in common use today during the early study of radioactivity various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names but such names are no longer used except for deuterium and tritium the symbols d and t instead of 2 h and 3 h are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium but the corresponding symbol for protium p is already in use for phosphorus and thus is not available for protium 57 in its nomenclatural guidelines the international union of pure and applied chemistry allows any of d t 2 h and 3 h to be used although 2 h and 3 h are preferred 58 history discovery and use in 1671 robert boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids which results in the production of hydrogen gas 59 60 in 1766 henry cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction inflammable air he speculated that inflammable air was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called phlogiston 61 62 and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned he is usually given credit for the discovery of hydrogen as an element 6 7 in 1783 antoine lavoisier gave the element the name hydrogen from the greek ὑδρο- hydro meaning water and -γενής genes meaning creator 8 when he and laplace reproduced cavendishs finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned 7 lavoisier produced hydrogen for his experiments on mass conservation by reacting a flux of steam with metallic iron through an incandescent iron tube heated in a fire anaerobic oxidation of iron by the protons of water at high temperature can be schematically represented by the set of following reactions many metals such as zirconium undergo a similar reaction with water leading to the production of hydrogen hydrogen was liquefied for the first time by james dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention the vacuum flask 7 he produced solid hydrogen the next year 7 deuterium was discovered in december 1931 by harold urey and tritium was prepared in 1934 by ernest rutherford mark oliphant and paul harteck 6 heavy water which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen was discovered by ureys group in 1932 7 françois isaac de rivaz built the first de rivaz engine an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806 edward daniel clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819 the döbereiners lamp and limelight were invented in 1823 7 the first hydrogen-filled balloon was invented by jacques charles in 1783 7 hydrogen provided the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by henri giffard 7 german count ferdinand von zeppelin promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called zeppelins the first of which had its maiden flight in 1900 7 regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of world war i in august 1914 they had carried 35,000 passengers without a serious incident hydrogen-lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war the first non-stop transatlantic crossing was made by the british airship r34 in 1919 regular passenger service resumed in the 1920s and the discovery of helium reserves in the united states promised increased safety but the us government refused to sell the gas for this purpose therefore h2 was used in the hindenburg airship which was destroyed in a midair fire over new jersey on 6 may 1937 7 the incident was broadcast live on radio and filmed ignition of leaking hydrogen is widely assumed to be the cause but later investigations pointed to the ignition of the aluminized fabric coating by static electricity but the damage to hydrogens reputation as a lifting gas was already done in the same year the first hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a coolant in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at dayton ohio by the dayton power  light co 63 because of the thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas this is the most common type in its field today the nickel hydrogen battery was used for the first time in 1977 aboard the us navys navigation technology satellite-2 nts-2 64 for example the iss 65 mars odyssey 66 and the mars global surveyor 67 are equipped with nickel-hydrogen batteries in the dark part of its orbit the hubble space telescope is also powered by nickel-hydrogen batteries which were finally replaced in may 2009 68 more than 19 years after launch and 13 years beyond their design life 69 role in quantum theory because of its simple atomic structure consisting only of a proton and an electron the hydrogen atom together with the spectrum of light produced from it or absorbed by it has been central to the development of the theory of atomic structure 70 furthermore study of the corresponding simplicity of the hydrogen molecule and the corresponding cation h 2 brought understanding of the nature of the chemical bond which followed shortly after the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom had been developed in the mid-1920s one of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed but not understood at the time was a maxwell observation involving hydrogen half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of h2 unaccountably departs from that of a diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures according to quantum theory this behavior arises from the spacing of the quantized rotational energy levels which are particularly wide-spaced in h2 because of its low mass these widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect 71 antihydrogen  h  is the antimatter counterpart to hydrogen it consists of an antiproton with a positron antihydrogen is the only type of antimatter atom to have been produced as of 2015 72 73 natural occurrence hydrogen as atomic h is the most abundant chemical element in the universe making up 75 of normal matter by mass and more than 90 by number of atoms most of the mass of the universe however is not in the form of chemical-element type matter but rather is postulated to occur as yet-undetected forms of mass such as dark matter and dark energy 74 this element is found in great abundance in stars and gas giant planets molecular clouds of h2 are associated with star formation hydrogen plays a vital role in powering stars through the proton-proton reaction and the cno cycle nuclear fusion 75 throughout the universe hydrogen is mostly found in the atomic and plasma states with properties quite different from those of molecular hydrogen as a plasma hydrogens electron and proton are not bound together resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity producing the light from the sun and other stars the charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields for example in the solar wind they interact with the earths magnetosphere giving rise to birkeland currents and the aurora hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the interstellar medium the large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the universe up to redshift z=4 76 under ordinary conditions on earth elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas h2 however hydrogen gas is very rare in the earths atmosphere  1 ppm by volume because of its light weight which enables it to escape from earths gravity more easily than heavier gases however hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the earths surface 77 mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water 42 hydrogen gas is produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural component of flatus as is methane itself a hydrogen source of increasing importance 78 a molecular form called protonated molecular hydrogen h 3 is found in the interstellar medium where it is generated by ionization of molecular hydrogen from cosmic rays this charged ion has also been observed in the upper atmosphere of the planet jupiter the ion is relatively stable in the environment of outer space due to the low temperature and density h 3 is one of the most abundant ions in the universe and it plays a notable role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium 79 neutral triatomic hydrogen h3 can exist only in an excited form and is unstable 80 by contrast the positive hydrogen molecular ion h 2 is a rare molecule in the universe production h 2 is produced in chemistry and biology laboratories often as a by-product of other reactions in industry for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates and in nature as a means of expelling reducing equivalents in biochemical reactions steam reforming hydrogen can be prepared in several different ways but economically the most important processes involve removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons as about 95 of hydrogen production came from steam reforming around year 2000 81 commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the steam reforming of natural gas 82 at high temperatures  1000–1400k 700–1100c or 1300–2000f steam water vapor reacts with methane to yield carbon monoxide and h 2 this reaction is favored at low pressures but is nonetheless conducted at high pressures  2.0 mpa 20atm or 600inhg this is because high-pressure h 2 is the most marketable product and pressure swing adsorption psa purification systems work better at higher pressures the product mixture is known as synthesis gas because it is often used directly for the production of methanol and related compounds hydrocarbons other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios one of the many complications to this highly optimized technology is the formation of coke or carbon consequently steam reforming typically employs an excess of h 2o additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon monoxide through the water gas shift reaction especially with an iron oxide catalyst this reaction is also a common industrial source of carbon dioxide 82 other important methods for h 2 production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons 83 and the coal reaction which can serve as a prelude to the shift reaction above 82 hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process without being separated in the haber process for the production of ammonia hydrogen is generated from natural gas 84 electrolysis of brine to yield chlorine also produces hydrogen as a co-product 85 metal-acid in the laboratory h 2 is usually prepared by the reaction of dilute non-oxidizing acids on some reactive metals such as zinc with kipps apparatus aluminium can also produce h 2 upon treatment with bases the electrolysis of water is a simple method of producing hydrogen a low voltage current is run through the water and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage if however the gas is to be burnt on site oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals iron for instance would oxidize and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off the theoretical maximum efficiency electricity used vs energetic value of hydrogen produced is in the range 80–94 86 an alloy of aluminium and gallium in pellet form added to water can be used to generate hydrogen the process also produces alumina but the expensive gallium which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets can be re-used this has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported 87 thermochemical there are more than 200 thermochemical cycles which can be used for water splitting around a dozen of these cycles such as the iron oxide cycle ceriumiv oxideceriumiii oxide cycle zinc zinc-oxide cycle sulfur-iodine cycle copper-chlorine cycle and hybrid sulfur cycle are under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity 88 a number of laboratories including in france germany greece japan and the usa are developing thermochemical methods to produce hydrogen from solar energy and water 89 anaerobic corrosion under anaerobic conditions iron and steel alloys are slowly oxidized by the protons of water concomitantly reduced in molecular hydrogen h 2 the anaerobic corrosion of iron leads first to the formation of ferrous hydroxide green rust and can be described by the following reaction in its turn under anaerobic conditions the ferrous hydroxide feoh 2  can be oxidized by the protons of water to form magnetite and molecular hydrogen this process is described by the schikorr reaction the well crystallized magnetite fe 3o 4 is thermodynamically more stable than the ferrous hydroxide feoh 2  this process occurs during the anaerobic corrosion of iron and steel in oxygen-free groundwater and in reducing soils below the water table geological occurrence the serpentinization reaction in the absence of atmospheric oxygen o 2 in deep geological conditions prevailing far away from earth atmosphere hydrogen h 2 is produced during the process of serpentinization by the anaerobic oxidation by the water protons h of the ferrous fe2 silicate present in the crystal lattice of the fayalite fe 2sio 4 the olivine iron-endmember the corresponding reaction leading to the formation of magnetite fe 3o 4 quartz sio 2 and hydrogen h 2 is the following this reaction closely resembles the schikorr reaction observed in the anaerobic oxidation of the ferrous hydroxide in contact with water formation in transformers from all the fault gases formed in power transformers hydrogen is the most common and is generated under most fault conditions thus formation of hydrogen is an early indication of serious problems in the transformers life cycle 90 applications consumption in processes large quantities of h 2 are needed in the petroleum and chemical industries the largest application of h 2 is for the processing upgrading of fossil fuels and in the production of ammonia the key consumers of h 2 in the petrochemical plant include hydrodealkylation hydrodesulfurization and hydrocracking h 2 has several other important uses h 2 is used as a hydrogenating agent particularly in increasing the level of saturation of unsaturated fats and oils found in items such as margarine and in the production of methanol it is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid h 2 is also used as a reducing agent of metallic ores 91 hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals 92 and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals 93 hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice 94 these properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks but the gass high solubility is a metallurgical problem contributing to the embrittlement of many metals 13 complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks 14 apart from its use as a reactant h 2 has wide applications in physics and engineering it is used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding 95 96 h2 is used as the rotor coolant in electrical generators at power stations because it has the highest thermal conductivity of any gas liquid h2 is used in cryogenic research including superconductivity studies 97 because h 2 is lighter than air having a little more than  1⁄14 of the density of air it was once widely used as a lifting gas in balloons and airships 98 in more recent applications hydrogen is used pure or mixed with nitrogen sometimes called forming gas as a tracer gas for minute leak detection applications can be found in the automotive chemical power generation aerospace and telecommunications industries 99 hydrogen is an authorized food additive e 949 that allows food package leak testing among other anti-oxidizing properties 100 hydrogens rarer isotopes also each have specific applications deuterium hydrogen-2 is used in nuclear fission applications as a moderator to slow neutrons and in nuclear fusion reactions 7 deuterium compounds have applications in chemistry and biology in studies of reaction isotope effects 101 tritium hydrogen-3 produced in nuclear reactors is used in the production of hydrogen bombs 102 as an isotopic label in the biosciences 56 and as a radiation source in luminous paints 103 the triple point temperature of equilibrium hydrogen is a defining fixed point on the its-90 temperature scale at 13.8033kelvins 104 coolant hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators due to a number of favorable properties that are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules these include low density low viscosity and the highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all gases energy carrier hydrogen is not an energy resource 105 except in the hypothetical context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium a technology presently far from development 106 the suns energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on earth 107 elemental hydrogen from solar biological or electrical sources require more energy to make it than is obtained by burning it so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier like a battery hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources such as methane but these sources are unsustainable 105 the energy density per unit volume of both liquid hydrogen and compressed hydrogen gas at any practicable pressure is significantly less than that of traditional fuel sources although the energy density per unit fuel mass is higher 105 nevertheless elemental hydrogen has been widely discussed in the context of energy as a possible future carrier of energy on an economy-wide scale 108 for example co 2 sequestration followed by carbon capture and storage could be conducted at the point of h 2 production from fossil fuels 109 hydrogen used in transportation would burn relatively cleanly with some nox emissions 110 but without carbon emissions 109 however the infrastructure costs associated with full conversion to a hydrogen economy would be substantial 111 fuel cells can convert hydrogen and oxygen directly to electricity more efficiently than internal combustion engines 112 semiconductor industry hydrogen is employed to saturate broken dangling bonds of amorphous silicon and amorphous carbon that helps stabilizing material properties 113 it is also a potential electron donor in various oxide materials including zno 114 115 sno2 cdo mgo 116 zro2 hfo2 la2o3 y2o3 tio2 srtio3 laalo3 sio2 al2o3 zrsio4 hfsio4 and srzro3 117 biological reactions h2 is a product of some types of anaerobic metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases these enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between h2 and its component two protons and two electrons creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water 118 the natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle 119 water splitting in which water is decomposed into its component protons electrons and oxygen occurs in the light reactions in all photosynthetic organisms some such organisms including the alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii and cyanobacteria have evolved a second step in the dark reactions in which protons and electrons are reduced to form h2 gas by specialized hydrogenases in the chloroplast 120 efforts have been undertaken to genetically modify cyanobacterial hydrogenases to efficiently synthesize h2 gas even in the presence of oxygen 121 efforts have also been undertaken with genetically modified alga in a bioreactor 122 safety and precautions hydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety from potential detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure oxygen-free form 123 in addition liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers such as frostbite associated with very cold liquids 124 hydrogen dissolves in many metals and in addition to leaking out may have adverse effects on them such as hydrogen embrittlement 125 leading to cracks and explosions 126 hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite moreover hydrogen fire while being extremely hot is almost invisible and thus can lead to accidental burns 127 even interpreting the hydrogen data including safety data is confounded by a number of phenomena many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogenorthohydrogen ratio it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio for which the data is usually given hydrogen detonation parameters such as critical detonation pressure and temperature strongly depend on the container geometry 123 notes references further reading online books resources
