technology technology science of craft from greek τέχνη techne art skill cunning of hand and -λογία -logia 2 is the collection of techniques skills methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives such as scientific investigation technology can be the knowledge of techniques processes and the like or it can be embedded in machines computers devices and factories which can be operated by individuals without detailed knowledge of the workings of such things the human species use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools the prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later neolithic revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment developments in historic times including the printing press the telephone and the internet have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale the steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power from clubs to nuclear weapons technology has many effects it has helped develop more advanced economies including todays global economy and has allowed the rise of a leisure class many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of earths environment various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity a term originally applied only to machines and the challenge of traditional norms philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it neo-luddism anarcho-primitivism and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition until recently it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates 3 and certain dolphin communities 4 have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations  contents 1 definition and usage 2 science engineering and technology 3

term was uncommon in english and usually referred to the description or study of the useful arts 5 the term was often connected to technical education as in the massachusetts institute of technology chartered in 1861 6 the term technology rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the second industrial revolution the terms meanings changed in the early 20th century when american social scientists beginning with thorstein veblen translated ideas from the german concept of technik into technology in german and other european languages a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in english which usually translates both terms as technology by the 1930s technology referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves 7 in 1937 the american sociologist read bain wrote that technology includes all tools machines utensils weapons instruments housing clothing communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them 8 bains definition remains common among scholars today especially social scientists but equally prominent is the definition of technology as applied science especially among scientists and engineers although most social scientists who study technology reject this definition 9 more recently scholars have borrowed from european philosophers of technique to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason as in foucaults work on technologies of the self techniques de soi dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions the merriam-webster learners dictionary offers a definition of the term the use of science in industry engineering etc to invent useful things or to solve problems and a machine piece of equipment method etc that is created by technology 10 ursula franklin in her 1989 real world of technology lecture gave another definition of the concept it is practice the way we do things around here 11 the term is often used to imply a specific field of technology or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics rather than technology as a whole 12 bernard stiegler in technics and time 1 defines technology in two ways as the pursuit of life by means other than life and as organized inorganic matter 13 technology can be most broadly defined as the entities both material and immaterial created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value in this usage technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems it is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools such as a crowbar or wooden spoon or more complex machines such as a space station or particle accelerator tools and machines need not be material virtual technology such as computer software and business methods fall under this definition of technology 14 w brian arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as a means to fulfill a human purpose 15 the word technology can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques in this context it is the current state of humanitys knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products to solve problems fulfill needs or satisfy wants it includes technical methods skills processes techniques tools and raw materials when combined with another term such as medical technology or space technology it refers to the state of the respective fields knowledge and tools state-of-the-art technology refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture 16 additionally technology is the application of math science and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known a modern example is the rise of communication technology which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the internet and the computer 17 not all technology enhances culture in a creative way technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns as a cultural activity technology predates both science and engineering each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor science engineering and technology the distinction between science engineering and technology is not always clear science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation 18 technologies are not usually exclusively products of science because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility usability and safety engineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means often but not always using results and techniques from science the development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge including scientific engineering mathematical linguistic and historical knowledge to achieve some practical result technology is often a consequence of science and engineering although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields for example science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already-existing tools and knowledge this new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors computers and other forms of advanced technology in this sense scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference 19 the exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists historians and policymakers in the late 20th century in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science in the immediate wake of world war ii for example it was widely considered in the united states that technology was simply applied science and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time an articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in vannevar bushs treatise on postwar science policy sciencethe endless frontier new products new industries and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature this essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research 20 in the late-1960s however this view came under direct attack leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks initiatives resisted by the scientific community the issue remains contentious though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research 21 22 history paleolithic  2.5 ma 10 ka the use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution early humans evolved from a species of foraging hominids which were already bipedal 23 with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans 24 tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history approximately 50,000 years ago the use of tools and complex set of behaviors emerged believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern language 25 stone tools hominids started using primitive stone tools millions of years ago the earliest stone tools were little more than a fractured rock but approximately 75,000 years ago 26 pressure flaking provided a way to make much finer work fire the discovery and utilization of fire a simple energy source with many profound uses was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind 27 the exact date of its discovery is not known evidence of burnt animal bones at the cradle of humankind suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before 1 ma 28 scholarly consensus indicates that homo erectus had controlled fire by between 500 and 400 ka 29 30 fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten 31 clothing and shelter other technological advances made during the paleolithic era were clothing and shelter the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly but they were a key to humanitys progress as the paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as 380 ka humans were constructing temporary wood huts 32 33 clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of africa by 200 ka and into other continents such as eurasia 34 neolithic through classical antiquity  10 ka 300 ce mans technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the neolithic period new stone age the invention of polished stone axes was a major advance that allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed simultaneously raising more children as infants no longer needed to be carried as nomadic ones must additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the hunter-gatherer economy 35 36 with this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization 37 what triggered the progression from early neolithic villages to the first cities such as uruk and the first civilizations such as sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role 38 metal tools continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided the ability to smelt and forge native metals naturally occurring in relatively pure form 39 gold copper silver and lead were such early metals the advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of neolithic times about 8000 bc 40 native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about 4000 bc the first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1400 bc energy and transport meanwhile humans were learning to harness other forms of energy the earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat 41 the earliest record of a ship under sail is shown on an egyptian pot dating back to 3200 bc 42 from prehistoric times egyptians probably used the power of the annual flooding of the nile to irrigate their lands gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and catch basins similarly the early peoples of mesopotamia the sumerians learned to use the tigris and euphrates rivers for much the same purposes but more extensive use of wind and water and even human power required another invention according to archaeologists the wheel was invented around 4000 bc probably independently and nearly simultaneously in mesopotamia in present-day iraq the northern caucasus maykop culture and central europe estimates on when this may have occurred range from 5500 to 3000 bc with most experts putting it closer to 4000 bc the oldest artifacts with drawings that depict wheeled carts date from about 3000 bc however the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made there is also evidence from the same period for the use of the potters wheel more recently the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world was found in the ljubljana marshes of slovenia 43 the invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war it did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads fast rotary potters wheels enabled early mass production of pottery but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy through water wheels windmills and even treadmills that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources medieval and modern history  300 ad present innovations continued through the middle ages with innovations such as silk the horse collar and horseshoes in the first few hundred years after the fall of the roman empire medieval technology saw the use of simple machines such as the lever the screw and the pulley being combined to form more complicated tools such as the wheelbarrow windmills and clocks the renaissance brought forth many of these innovations including the printing press which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge and technology became increasingly associated with science beginning a cycle of mutual advancement the advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food followed by the wider availability of consumer goods starting in the united kingdom in the 18th century the industrial revolution was a period of great technological discovery particularly in the areas of agriculture manufacturing mining metallurgy and transport driven by the discovery of steam power technology took another step in a second industrial revolution with the harnessing of electricity to create such innovations as the electric motor light bulb and countless others scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for powered flight and advancements in medicine chemistry physics and engineering the rise in technology has led to skyscrapers and broad urban areas whose inhabitants rely on motors to transport them and their daily bread communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the telegraph telephone radio and television the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the airplane and automobile the 20th century brought a host of innovations in physics the discovery of nuclear fission has led to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power computers were also invented and later miniaturized utilizing transistors and integrated circuits information technology subsequently led to the creation of the internet which ushered in the current information age humans have also been able to explore space with satellites later used for telecommunication and in manned missions going all the way to the moon in medicine this era brought innovations such as open-heart surgery and later stem cell therapy along with new medications and treatments complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies and entire industries have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools modern technology increasingly relies on training and education their designers builders maintainers and users often require sophisticated general and specific training moreover these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them including engineering medicine and computer science and other fields have been made more complex such as construction transportation and architecture philosophy technicism generally technicism is a reliance or confidence in technology as a benefactor of society taken to extreme technicism is the belief that humanity will ultimately be able to control the entirety of existence using technology in other words human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology some such as stephen v monsma 44 connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority optimism optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and singularitarianism which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition in these ideologies technological development is morally good some critics see these ideologies as examples of scientism and techno-utopianism and fear the notion of human enhancement and technological singularity which they support some have described karl marx as a techno-optimist 45 skepticism and critics on the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like herbert marcuse and john zerzan who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed they suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health many such as the luddites and prominent philosopher martin heidegger hold serious although not entirely deterministic reservations about technology see the question concerning technology 46 according to heidegger scholars hubert dreyfus and charles spinosa heidegger does not oppose technology he hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or what comes to the same thing to rebel helplessly against it indeed he promises that when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim 47 what this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno-optimists or techno-pessimists tend to allow 48 some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics for example aldous huxleys brave new world and other writings anthony burgesss a clockwork orange and george orwells nineteen eighty-four and in faust by goethe fausts selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology more recently modern works of science fiction such as those by philip k dick and william gibson and films eg blade runner ghost in the shell project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technologys impact on human society and identity the late cultural critic neil postman distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and finally what he called technopolies that is societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices values and world-views 49 darin barney has written about technologys impact on practices of citizenship and democratic culture suggesting that technology can be construed as  1 an object of political debate  2 a means or medium of discussion and  3 a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship as a setting for democratic culture barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions including the question of what a good life consists in nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology 50 nikolas kompridis has also written about the dangers of new technology such as genetic engineering nanotechnology synthetic biology and robotics he warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature these concerns are shared by other philosophers scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues eg francis fukuyama jürgen habermas william joy and michael sandel 51 another prominent critic of technology is hubert dreyfus who has published books on the internet and what computers still cant do another more infamous anti-technological treatise is industrial society and its future written by theodore kaczynski aka the unabomber and printed in several major newspapers and later books as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure appropriate technology the notion of appropriate technology however was developed in the 20th century eg see the work of e f schumacher and of jacques ellul to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized infrastructure or parts or skills imported from elsewhere the eco-village movement emerged in part due to this concern optimism and skepticism in the 21st century this article mainly focusses on american concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other western countries the inadequate quantity and quality of american jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face  whats the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem in his article jared bernstein a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities 52 questions the widespread idea that automation and more broadly technological advances have mainly contributed to this growing labor market problem his thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism basically he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and american issues concerning unemployment and eroding wages he uses two main arguments to defend his point first of all because of recent technological advances an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs yet scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved indeed automationthreatens repetitive jobs but higher-end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that requires flexibility judgment and common sense 53 remain hard to be replaced by machinessecond studies have not defined clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades therefore according to jared bernstein instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current american increasing unemployment and eroding wages one needs to worry more about bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand trade income and opportunity 53 complex technological systems thomas p hughes pointed out that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently 54 what is the difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove can we consider all of them only a part of them or none of them as technologies technology is often considered too narrowly according to thomas p hughes technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity 54 this definition emphasizing on creativity avoids unbounded definition that may mistakenly include cooking technologies but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems yet because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies hughes argued that engineers scientists and managers often have believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want they have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned 54 for instance evgeny morozov particularly challenges two concepts internet-centrism and solutionism 55 internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet in fact technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations according to alexis madrigals critique of morozovs theory to ignore it will lead to unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address 56 benjamin cohen and gwen ottinger precisely discussed the multivalent effects of technology 57 therefore recognition of the limitations of technology and more broadly scientific knowledge is needed  especially in cases dealing with environmental justice and health issues gwen ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers new comprehension of their role such an approach of technology and science require technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently they have to consider themselves as collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions 58 competitiveness technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function the science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane but it is all technology and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage technology-based planning is what was used to build the us industrial giants before wwii eg dow dupont gm and it what was used to transform the us into a superpower it was not economic-based planning project socrates in 1983 project socrates was initiated in the us intelligence community to determine the source of declining us economic and military competitiveness project socrates concluded that technology exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage and that declining us competitiveness was from decision-making in the private and public sectors switching from technology exploitation technology-based planning to money exploitation economic-based planning at the end of world war ii project socrates determined that to rebuild us competitiveness decision making throughout the us had to readopt technology-based planning project socrates also determined that countries like china and india had continued executing technology-based while the us took its detour into economic-based planning and as a result had considerably advanced the process and were using it to build themselves into superpowers to rebuild us competitiveness the us decision-makers needed to adopt a form of technology-based planning that was far more advanced than that used by china and india project socrates determined that technology-based planning makes an evolutionary leap forward every few hundred years and the next evolutionary leap the automated innovation revolution was poised to occur in the automated innovation revolution the process for determining how to acquire and utilize technology for a competitive advantage which includes rd is automated so that it can be executed with unprecedented speed efficiency and agility project socrates developed the means for automated innovation so that the us could lead the automated innovation revolution in order to rebuild and maintain the countrys economic competitiveness for many generations 59 60 61 other animal species the use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans these include primates such as chimpanzees some dolphin communities 62 63 and crows 64 65 considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams or bees and their honeycombs the ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus homo 66 however the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans for example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging some of the tools used include leaf sponges termite fishing probes pestles and levers 67 west african chimpanzees also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts 68 as do capuchin monkeys of boa vista brazil 69 future technology theories of technology often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the high
