energy transition energy transition is generally defined as a long-term structural change in energy systems 1 these have occurred in the past and still occur worldwide historic energy transitions are most broadly described by vaclav smil 2 contemporary energy transitions differ in terms of motivation and objectives drivers and governance in a more narrow sense a sustainable energy transition is the shift by some countries most notably germany german energiewende to decentralised renewable energy and energy efficiency although so far these shifts have been replacing nuclear energy their declared goal is also the abolishment of coal and other non-renewable energy sources 3 and the creation of an energy system based on 100 renewable energy renewable energy encompasses wind hydropower solar power thermal and photovoltaic geothermal and ocean power these renewable sources are to serve as an alternative to fossil fuels oil coal natural gas and nuclear fuel uranium solving the energy problem is regarded as the most important challenge facing humankind in the 21st century 4 piecemeal measures often have only limited potential so a timely implementation for the energy transition requires multiple approaches in parallel energy conservation and improvements in energy efficiency thus play a major role an example of an effective energy efficiency measure is improved insulation for buildings smart electric meters can schedule energy consumption for times when electricity is available inexpensively after such a transitional period with a continuing increase in renewable energy production these are expected to make up most if not all of the worlds energy production in 50 years according to a 2011 projection by the international energy agency dramatically reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases 5  contents 1 the term energy transition 2 status in specific countries 2.1 austria 2.2 united kingdom 2.3 denmark 2.4 france 2.5 germany 2.6 japan 3 see also 4

significant change in energy policy the term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation for example producing heat and power in very small cogeneration units which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency in a broader sense the energy transition also entails a democratization of energy 6 in the traditional energy industry a few large companies with large centralized power stations dominate the market as an oligopoly and consequently amass a worrisome level of both economic and political power renewable energies in contrast can as a rule be established in a decentralized manner public wind farms and solar parks can involve many citizens directly in energy production 7 photovoltaic systems can even be set up by individuals municipal utilities can also benefit citizens financially while the conventional energy industry profits a relatively small number of shareholders also significant the decentralized structure of renewable energies enables creation of value locally and minimizes capital outflows from a region renewable energy sources therefore play an increasingly important role in municipal energy policy and local governments often promote them there is lots of room for growth with wind solar geothermal and biomass for power they represented 2 of global final energy consumption in 2012 8 the speed at which a transition in the energy sector needs to take place will be historically rapid 9 moreover the underlying technological political and economic structures will need to change radically  a process one author calls regime shift 10 status in specific countriesedit austriaedit austria embarked on its energy transition energiewende some decades ago due to geographical conditions energy production in austria relies heavily on renewable energies notably hydropower 78.4 of domestic production in 2013 came from renewable energy 9.2 from natural gas and 7.2 from petroleum rest waste on the basis of the federal constitutional law for a nuclear-free austria no nuclear power plants are in operation in austria but domestic energy production makes up only 36 of austrias total energy consumption which among other things encompasses transport electricity production and heating in 2013 oil accounts for about 36.2 of total energy consumption renewable energies 29.8 gas 20.6 and coal 9.7 in the past 20 years the structure of gross domestic energy consumption has shifted from coal and oil to new renewables in particular between 2005 and 2013 plus 60 the eu target for austria require a renewables share of 34 by 2020 gross final energy consumption austria is on a good way to achieve this target  32.5 in 2013 energy transition in austria can be also seen on the local level in some villages towns and regions for example the town of güssing in the state of burgenland is a pioneer in independent and sustainable energy production since 2005 güssing has already produced significantly more heating  58 gigawatt hours and electricity  14 gwh from renewable resources than the city itself needs 11 united kingdomedit the united kingdom is mainly focusing on wind power both onshore and offshore and in particular is strongly promoting the establishment of offshore wind power with an installed capacity of 2.1 gw about half of the worlds installed offshore wind power britain is the worldwide leader at the end of 2012 the country had an 8.4 gw of overall installed wind power capacity putting it in fourth place worldwide after china the united states and germany it was initially promoted with a quota system but expansion targets were missed repeatedly this led the government to implement a feed-in tariff instead 12 denmarkedit denmark as a country reliant on imported oil was impacted particularly hard by the 1973 oil crisis this roused public discussions on building nuclear power plants to diversify energy supply a strong anti-nuclear movement developed which fiercely criticized nuclear power plans taken up by the government 13 and this ultimately led to a 1985 resolution not to build any nuclear power plants in denmark 14 the country instead opted for renewable energy focusing primarily on wind power wind turbines for power generation already had a long history in denmark as far back as the late 1800s as early as 1974 a panel of experts declared that it should be possible to satisfy 10 of danish electricity demand with wind power without causing special technical problems for the public grid 15 denmark undertook the development of large wind power stations  though at first with little success like with the growian project in germany small facilities prevailed instead often sold to private owners such as farms government policies promoted their construction at the same time positive geographical factors favored their spread such as good wind power density and denmarks decentralized patterns of settlement a lack of administrative obstacles also played a role small and robust systems came on line at first in the power range of only 50-60 kilowatts  using 1940s technology and sometimes hand-crafted by very small businesses in the late seventies and the eighties a brisk export trade to the united states developed where wind energy also experienced an early boom in 1986 denmark already had about 1200 wind power turbines 16 though they still accounted for just barely 1 of denmarks electricity 17 this share increased significantly over time in 2011 renewable energies covered 41 of electricity consumption and wind power facilities alone accounted for 28 18 the government aims to increase wind energys share of power generation to 50 by 2020 while at the same time reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 40 19 on 22 march 2012 the danish ministry of climate energy and building published a four-page paper titled dk energy agreement outlining long-term principles for danish energy policy 20 the installation of oil and gas heating is banned in newly constructed buildings from the start of 2013 beginning in 2016 this will also apply to existing buildings at the same time an assistance program for heater replacement was launched denmarks goal is to reduce the use of fossil fuels 33 by 2020 the country is scheduled to attain complete independence from petroleum and natural gas by 2050 21 franceedit since 2012 political discussions have been developing in france about the energy transition and how the french economy might profit from it 22 in september 2012 minister of the environment delphine batho coined the term ecological patriotism the government began a work plan to consider starting the energy transition in france this plan should address the following questions by june 2013 23 how can france move towards energy efficiency and energy conservation reflections on altered lifestyles changes in production consumption and transport how to achieve the energy mix targeted for 2025 frances climate protection targets call for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and 60 by 2040 which renewable energies should france rely on how should the use of wind and solar energy can be promoted what costs and funding models will likely be required for alternative energy consulting and investment support and how about for research renovation and expansion of district heating biomass and geothermal energy one solution could be a continuation of the cspe a tax that is charged on electricity bills the environmental conference on sustainable development on 14 and 15 september 2012 treated the issue of the environmental and energy transition as its main theme 24 on 8 july 2013 the national debate leaders submits some proposals to the government among them there were environmental taxation and smart grid development 25 in 2015 the national assembly has adopted legislation for the transition to low emission vehicles 26 france is second only to denmark as having the worlds lowest carbon emissions in relation to gross domestic product 27 germanyedit the key policy document outlining the energiewende was published by the german government in september 2010 some six months before the fukushima nuclear accident 29 legislative support was passed in september 2010 important aspects include in addition there will be an associated research and development drive the policy has been embraced by the german federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables particularly wind power germanys share of renewables has increased from around 5 in 1999 to 17 in 2010 reaching close to the oecd average of 18 usage of renewables 31 producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for 20 years guaranteeing a fixed income energy co-operatives have been created and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits the large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market nuclear power plants were closed and the existing nine plants will close earlier than necessary in 2022 the reduction of reliance on nuclear plants has had the consequence of increased reliance on fossil fuels one factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market it is believed 8300km of power lines must be built or upgraded 31 different länder have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the energiewende have been passed on to consumers who have had rising electricity bills germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity costs in europe 32 nonetheless for the first time in more than ten years electricity prices for household customers fell at the beginning of 2015 30 japanedit on 14 september 2012 the japanese government decided at a ministerial meeting in tokyo to phase out nuclear power by the 2030s or 2040 at the very latest the government said that it would take all possible measures to achieve this goal 33 a few days later the government retrenched the planned nuclear phaseout after the industry pushed for reconsideration arguments cited were that a nuclear phaseout would burden the economy and that imports of oil coal and gas would bring high added costs the government then approved the energy transition but left open the time-frame for decommissioning the nuclear power plants 34 see alsoedit amory lovins energy transition in
