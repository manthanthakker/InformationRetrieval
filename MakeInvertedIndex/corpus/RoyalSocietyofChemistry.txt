royal society of chemistry united kingdom the royal society of chemistry rsc is a learned society professional association in the united kingdom with the goal of advancing the chemical sciences it was formed in 1980 from the merger of the chemical society the royal institute of chemistry the faraday society and the society for analytical chemistry with a new royal charter and the dual role of learned society and professional body at its inception the society had a combined membership of 34,000 in the uk and a further 8,000 abroad 2 the headquarters of the society are at burlington house piccadilly london it also has offices in thomas graham house in cambridge named for thomas graham the first president of the chemical society where rsc publishing is based the society has offices in the united states at the university city science center philadelphia in both beijing and shanghai china and bangalore india 3 the organisation carries out research publishes journals books and databases as well as hosting conferences seminars and workshops it is the professional body for chemistry in the uk with the ability to award the status of chartered chemist cchem and through the science council the awards of chartered scientist csci registered scientist rsci and registered science technician rsctech to suitably qualified candidates the designation frsc is given to a group of elected fellows of the society who have made major contributions to chemistry and other interface disciplines such as biological chemistry the names of fellows are published each year in the times

and overseen by the rsc 19 it replaced the gric offered by the royal institute of chemistry divisionsedit the society is organised around 9 divisions based on subject areas and local sections both in the united kingdom and overseas divisions cover broad areas of chemistry but also contain many special interest groups for more specific areas analytical division for analytical chemistry and promoting the original aims of the society for analytical chemistry 12 subject groups dalton division named after john dalton for inorganic chemistry 6 subject groups education division for chemical education 4 subject groups faraday division named after michael faraday for physical chemistry and promoting the original aims of the faraday society 14 subject groups organic division for organic chemistry 6 subject groups chemical biology interface division 2 subject groups environment sustainability and energy division 3 subject groups materials chemistry division 4 subject groups industry and technology division 13 subject groups there are 12 subjects groups not attached to a division local sectionsedit there are 35 local sections covering the united kingdom and ireland in countries of the commonwealth of nations and many other countries there are local representatives of the society and often some activities publicationsedit the society is a not-for-profit publisher surplus made by its publishing business is invested to support its aim of advancing the chemical sciences in addition to scientific journals including its flagship journals chemical communications chemical science and chemical society reviews the society publishes education in chemistry for teachers a free online journal for chemistry educators chemistry education research and practice a general chemistry magazine chemistry world sent monthly to all members of the society throughout the world the editorial board consists of 10 academic and industrial chemists it was first published in january 2004 it replaced chemistry in britain first published in 1965 its contents include news articles of a general chemical nature such as the history of chemistry and technological developments book reviews and letters from readers its issn is 1473-7604 chemistry world is supported by the chemistry world podcast which is presented by cambridge university scientist dr chris smith who also edits the naked scientists professional reference books across the chemical sciences 20 books for students including the tutorial chemistry texts series of 23 books edited by e w abel and the 8 books in the molecular world series whose coordinating editor is l e smart books on the history of chemistry such as a history of the faraday society subscriptions to the journals are available individually or all-in under a provision called rsc gold 21 burlington houseedit the london offices of the society are in burlington house piccadilly events are hosted here for the public rsc member groups and external organisations including monthly lectures on the chemical sciences that streamed live via the rscs public engagement website  the reaction the free lectures take an interesting look at the chemical aspects of a wide range of topics from curry to the enjoyment of music the events have attracted notable science writers such as philip ball antony john williams and john emsley to give public lectures most of these are available as archived video streams via the rscs reaction website 22 historyedit although opened as the chemistry centre in 2010 the building has been occupied by the royal society of chemistry since 1857 at which time it was known as the chemical society  the heart of the chemistry centre is the rscs library and information centre which itself dates back to 1842 over the years the library for the rsc has received many gifts from notable fellows including michael faraday the library became a centre for information on the chemical sciences during the 1st and 2nd world wars when extensive use was made on the chemical reference material available in november 2014 the society announced that the centre would be rebranded as simply royal society of chemistry at burlington house and the name chemistry centre dropped library and information centreedit the society has a large library covering mainly chemistry-based subjects including online access for members housed at the chemistry centre at burlington house it is part of the chemistry centre and is a resource for rsc members although the public are also welcome benevolent fundedit the royal society of chemistrys benevolent fund supports the members and their families during difficult times through advice and guidance financial support and volunteer support 23 it dates back to 1920 when the institute of chemistry later the royal institute of chemistry established it as a memorial to its members who died in the first world war it had an aim to help necessitous persons who are or have been fellows or associates of the institute their wives or children and the widows and dependent relatives of deceased fellows and associates through voluntary contributions from members the benevolent funds ethos of members helping members stems from the institute of chemistrys council raising money for members in need from other members prior to the fund being formed 24 in 1960 the benevolent fund introduced a volunteer visitor system where members were asked to visit applicants beneficiaries elderly and housebound members in their area each local section was also appointed a fund representative 25 a major review of the fund to modernize it took place in 2003-2004 forming a new strategy document that is updated every three years it underwent another review in 2014 with the aim to widen its reach and provide a more holistic support wider than financial assistance to royal society of chemistry members and their families 26 the benevolent fund committee formed of volunteer members of the royal society of chemistry oversees the benevolent fund and meet every three months 27 prizes and awardsedit the rsc awards a variety of prizes and awards each year that include awards for excellence in any area of chemistry in specialist areas or for achievement at particular stages of a chemists career 28 medals are awarded centrally by the rsc and by the divisions of the organisation there are also awards that are administered by rsc interest groups the centrally awarded medals include the harrison-meldola memorial prizes which are awarded to a british chemist who is under 32 years of age for promising original investigations in chemistry 29 and the corday-morgan medals which consist of three separate awards made for the most meritorious contributions to experimental chemistry including computer simulation 30 the tilden prize previously known as the tilden lecture consists of three awards annually to scientists in mid-career for advances in chemistry previous winners of the harrison-meldola prize known as the meldola medal and prize prior to its merger in 2008 with the edward harrison prize include christopher kelk ingold  1921 1922 cyril norman
