intermittency in dynamical systems intermittency is the irregular alternation of phases of apparently periodic and chaotic dynamics pomeaumanneville dynamics or different forms of chaotic dynamics crisis-induced intermittency 1 2 pomeau and manneville described three routes to intermittency where a nearly periodic system shows irregularly spaced bursts of chaos  3 these type i ii and iii correspond to the approach to a saddle-node bifurcation a subcritical hopf bifurcation or an inverse period-doubling bifurcation in the apparently periodic phases the behaviour is only nearly periodic slowly drifting away from an unstable periodic orbit eventually the system gets far enough away from the periodic orbit to be affected by chaotic dynamics in the rest of the state space until it gets close to the orbit again and returns to the nearly periodic behaviour since the time spent near the periodic orbit depends sensitively on how closely the system entered its vicinity in turn determined by what happened during the chaotic period the length of each phase is unpredictable another kind on-off intermittency occurs when a previously transversally stable chaotic attractor with dimension less than the embedding space begins to lose stability near unstable orbits within the attractor orbits can escape into the surrounding space producing a temporary burst before returning to the attractor  4 in crisis-induced intermittency a chaotic attractor suffers a crisis where two or more attractors cross the boundaries of each others basin of attraction as an orbit moves through the first attractor it can cross over the boundary and become attracted to the second attractor where it will stay until its dynamics moves it across the boundary again intermittent behaviour is commonly observed in fluid flows that are turbulent or near the transition to turbulence in highly turbulent flows intermittency is seen in the irregular dissipation of kinetic energy it is also seen in the irregular alternation between turbulent and non-turbulent fluid that appear in turbulent jets and other turbulent free shear flows in pipe flow and other wall bounded shear flows there are intermittent puffs that are central to the process of transition from laminar to turbulent flow intermittent behavior has also been experimentally demonstrated in circuit oscillators and chemical reactions see alsoedit crisis dynamical systems turbulent flow fluorescence intermittency blinking of organic molecules and colloidal quantum dots nanocrystals referencesedit staicu a d  2002 intermittency in turbulence pdf eindhoven university of technology vassilicos j c  2000 intermittency in turbulent flows cambridge university press p 288 bibcode:2000itfbookv isbn 0-521-79221-5 external linksedit transition to chaos through intermittency
