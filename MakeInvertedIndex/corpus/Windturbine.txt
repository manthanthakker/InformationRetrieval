wind turbine biofuel biomass geothermal hydropower solar energy tidal power wave power wind power topics by country 100 renewable energy marketing and policy trends v t e a wind turbine is a device that converts the winds kinetic energy into electrical power wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis types the smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power for boats or caravans or to power traffic warning signs slightly larger turbines can be used for making contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid arrays of large turbines known as wind farms are becoming an increasingly important source of intermittent renewable energy and are used by many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels  contents 1 history 2 resources 3 efficiency 4 types 4.1 horizontal axis 4.2 vertical axis 5 design and

of the first known instances of wind powering a machine in history 2 3 however the first known practical windmills were built in sistan an eastern province of iran from the 7th century these panemone were vertical axle windmills which had long vertical drive shafts with rectangular blades 4 made of six to twelve sails covered in reed matting or cloth material these windmills were used to grind grain or draw up water and were used in the gristmilling and sugarcane industries 5 windmills first appeared in europe during the middle ages the first historical records of their use in england date to the 11th or 12th centuries and there are reports of german crusaders taking their windmill-making skills to syria around 1190 6 by the 14th century dutch windmills were in use to drain areas of the rhine delta advanced wind mills were described by croatian inventor fausto veranzio in his book machinae novae  1595 he described vertical axis wind turbines with curved or v-shaped blades the first electricity-generating wind turbine was a battery charging machine installed in july 1887 by scottish academic james blyth to light his holiday home in marykirk scotland 7 some months later american inventor charles f brush was able to build the first automatically operated wind turbine after consulting local university professors and colleagues jacob s gibbs and brinsley coleberd and successfully getting the blueprints peer-reviewed for electricity production in cleveland ohio 7 although blyths turbine was considered uneconomical in the united kingdom 7 electricity generation by wind turbines was more cost effective in countries with widely scattered populations 6 in denmark by 1900 there were about 2500 windmills for mechanical loads such as pumps and mills producing an estimated combined peak power of about 30 mw the largest machines were on 24-meter  79ft towers with four-bladed 23-meter  75ft diameter rotors by 1908 there were 72 wind-driven electric generators operating in the united states from 5kw to 25kw around the time of world war i american windmill makers were producing 100,000 farm windmills each year mostly for water-pumping 9 by the 1930s wind generators for electricity were common on farms mostly in the united states where distribution systems had not yet been installed in this period high-tensile steel was cheap and the generators were placed atop prefabricated open steel lattice towers a forerunner of modern horizontal-axis wind generators was in service at yalta ussr in 1931 this was a 100kw generator on a 30-meter  98ft tower connected to the local 6.3kv distribution system it was reported to have an annual capacity factor of 32 percent not much different from current wind machines 10 in the autumn of 1941 the first megawatt-class wind turbine was synchronized to a utility grid in vermont the smith-putnam wind turbine only ran for 1,100 hours before suffering a critical failure the unit was not repaired because of shortage of materials during the war the first utility grid-connected wind turbine to operate in the uk was built by john brown  company in 1951 in the orkney islands 7 11 despite these diverse developments developments in fossil fuel systems almost entirely eliminated any wind turbine systems larger than supermicro size in the early 1970s however anti-nuclear protests in denmark spurred artisan mechanics to develop microturbines of 22kw organizing owners into associations and co-operatives lead to the lobbying of the government and utilities and provided incentives for larger turbines throughout the 1980s and later local activists in germany nascent turbine manufacturers in spain and large investors in the united states in the early 1990s then lobbied for policies that stimulated the industry in those countries later companies formed in india and china as of 2012 danish company vestas is the worlds biggest wind-turbine manufacturer resourcesedit a quantitative measure of the wind energy available at any location is called the wind power density wpd it is a calculation of the mean annual power available per square meter of swept area of a turbine and is tabulated for different heights above ground calculation of wind power density includes the effect of wind velocity and air density color-coded maps are prepared for a particular area described for example as mean annual power density at 50 metres in the united states the results of the above calculation are included in an index developed by the national renewable energy laboratory and referred to as nrel class the larger the wpd the higher it is rated by class classes range from class 1  200 watts per square meter or less at 50m altitude to class 7  800 to 2000 watts per square m commercial wind farms generally are sited in class 3 or higher areas although isolated points in an otherwise class 1 area may be practical to exploit 12 wind turbines are classified by the wind speed they are designed for from class i to class iv with a or b referring to the turbulence 13 efficiencyedit not all the energy of blowing wind can be used but some small wind turbines are designed to work at low wind speeds 14 conservation of mass requires that the amount of air entering and exiting a turbine must be equal accordingly betzs law gives the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine as 16/27  59.3 of the total kinetic energy of the air flowing through the turbine 15 the maximum theoretical power output of a wind machine is thus 0.59 times the kinetic energy of the air passing through the effective disk area of the machine if the effective area of the disk is a and the wind velocity v the maximum theoretical power output p is where œÅ is air density as wind is free no fuel cost wind-to-rotor efficiency including rotor blade friction and drag is one of many aspects impacting the final price of wind power 16 further inefficiencies such as gearbox losses generator and converter losses reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine to protect components from undue wear extracted power is held constant above the rated operating speed as theoretical power increases at the cube of wind speed further reducing theoretical efficiency in 2001 commercial utility-connected turbines deliver 75 to 80 of the betz limit of power extractable from the wind at rated operating speed 17 18needs update efficiency can decrease slightly over time due to wear analysis of 3128 wind turbines older than 10 years in denmark showed that half of the turbines had no decrease while the other half saw a production decrease of 1.2 per year 19 vertical turbine designs have much lower efficiency than standard horizontal designs 20 typesedit wind turbines can rotate about either a horizontal or a vertical axis the former being both older and more common 21 they can also include blades transparent or not 22 or be bladeless 23 vertical designs produce less power and are less common 24 horizontal axisedit horizontal-axis wind turbines hawt have the main rotor shaft and electrical generator at the top of a tower and must be pointed into the wind small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a servo motor most have a gearbox which turns the slow rotation of the blades into a quicker rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator 25 since a tower produces turbulence behind it the turbine is usually positioned upwind of its supporting tower turbine blades are made stiff to prevent the blades from being pushed into the tower by high winds additionally the blades are placed a considerable distance in front of the tower and are sometimes tilted forward into the wind a small amount downwind machines have been built despite the problem of turbulence mast wake because they dont need an additional mechanism for keeping them in line with the wind and because in high winds the blades can be allowed to bend which reduces their swept area and thus their wind resistance since cyclical that is repetitive turbulence may lead to fatigue failures most hawts are of upwind design turbines used in wind farms for commercial production of electric power are usually three-bladed and pointed into the wind by computer-controlled motors these have high tip speeds of over 320kmh  200mph high efficiency and low torque ripple which contribute to good reliability the blades are usually colored white for daytime visibility by aircraft and range in length from 20 to 40 meters  66 to 131ft or more the tubular steel towers range from 60 to 90 meters  200 to 300ft tall the blades rotate at 10 to 22 revolutions per minute at 22 rotations per minute the tip speed exceeds 90 meters per second  300fts 26 27 a gear box is commonly used for stepping up the speed of the generator although designs may also use direct drive of an annular generator some models operate at constant speed but more energy can be collected by variable-speed turbines which use a solid-state power converter to interface to the transmission system all turbines are equipped with protective features to avoid damage at high wind speeds by feathering the blades into the wind which ceases their rotation supplemented by brakes year by year the size and height of turbines increase offshore wind turbines are built up to 8mw today and have a blade length up to 80m onshore wind turbines are installed in low wind speed areas and getting higher and higher towers usual towers of multi megawatt turbines have a height of 70m to 120m and in extremes up to 160m with blade tip speeds reaching 80ms to 90ms higher tip speeds means more noise and blade erosion vertical axisedit vertical-axis wind turbines or vawts have the main rotor shaft arranged vertically one advantage of this arrangement is that the turbine does not need to be pointed into the wind to be effective which is an advantage on a site where the wind direction is highly variable it is also an advantage when the turbine is integrated into a building because it is inherently less steerable also the generator and gearbox can be placed near the ground using a direct drive from the rotor assembly to the ground-based gearbox improving accessibility for maintenance however these designs produce much less energy averaged over time which is a major drawback 24 28 the key disadvantages include the relatively low rotational speed with the consequential higher torque and hence higher cost of the drive train the inherently lower power coefficient the 360-degree rotation of the aerofoil within the wind flow during each cycle and hence the highly dynamic loading on the blade the pulsating torque generated by some rotor designs on the drive train and the difficulty of modelling the wind flow accurately and hence the challenges of analysing and designing the rotor prior to fabricating a prototype 29 when a turbine is mounted on a rooftop the building generally redirects wind over the roof and this can double the wind speed at the turbine if the height of a rooftop mounted turbine tower is approximately 50 of the building height it is near the optimum for maximum wind energy and minimum wind turbulence wind speeds within the built environment are generally much lower than at exposed rural sites 30 31 noise may be a concern and an existing structure may not adequately resist the additional stress subtypes of the vertical axis design include another type of vertical axis is the parallel turbine which is similar to the crossflow fan or centrifugal fan it uses the ground effect vertical axis turbines of this type have been tried for many years a unit producing 10kw was built by israeli wind pioneer bruce brill in the 1980s 37unreliable source design and constructionedit wind turbines are designed to exploit the wind energy that exists at a location aerodynamic modeling is used to determine the optimum tower height control systems number of blades and blade shape wind turbines convert wind energy to electricity for distribution conventional horizontal axis turbines can be divided into three components the rotor component which is approximately 20 of the wind turbine cost includes the blades for converting wind energy to low speed rotational energy the generator component which is approximately 34 of the wind turbine cost includes the electrical generator 40 41 the control electronics and most likely a gearbox eg planetary gearbox 42 adjustable-speed drive or continuously variable transmission 43 component for converting the low speed incoming rotation to high speed rotation suitable for generating electricity the structural support component which is approximately 15 of the wind turbine cost includes the tower and rotor yaw mechanism 44 a 1.5 mw wind turbine of a type frequently seen in the united states has a tower 80 meters  260ft high the rotor assembly blades and hub weighs 22,000 kilograms  48,000lb the nacelle which contains the generator component weighs 52,000 kilograms  115,000lb the concrete base for the tower is constructed using 26,000 kilograms  58,000lb of reinforcing steel and contains 190 cubic meters  250cuyd of concrete the base is 15 meters  50ft in diameter and 2.4 meters  8ft thick near the center 45 among all renewable energy systems wind turbines have the highest effective intensity of power-harvesting surface 46 because turbine blades not only harvest wind power but also concentrate it 47dubious  discuss unconventional designsedit an e-66 wind turbine in the windpark holtriem germany has an observation deck for visitors another turbine of the same type with an observation deck is located in swaffham england airborne wind turbine designs have been proposed and developed for many years but have yet to produce significant amounts of energy in principle wind turbines may also be used in conjunction with a large vertical solar updraft tower to extract the energy due to air heated by the sun wind turbines which utilise the magnus effect have been developed 48 a ram air turbine rat is a special kind of small turbine that is fitted to some aircraft when deployed the rat is spun by the airstream going past the aircraft and can provide power for the most essential systems if there is a loss of all on-board electrical power 49 as in the case of the gimli glider the two-bladed turbine scd 6mw offshore turbine designed by aerodyn energiesysteme built by mingyang wind power has a helideck for helicopters on top of its nacelle the prototype was erected in 2014 in rudong china turbine monitoring and diagnosticsedit due to data transmission problems structural health monitoring of wind turbines is usually performed using several accelerometers and strain gages attached to the nacelle to monitor the gearbox and equipments currently digital image correlation and stereophotogrammetry are used to measure dynamics of wind turbine blades these methods usually measure displacement and strain to identify location of defects dynamic characteristics of non-rotating wind turbines have been measured using digital image correlation and photogrammetry 50 three dimensional point tracking has also been used to measure rotating dynamics of wind turbines 51 materials and durabilityedit materials that are typically used for the rotor blades in wind turbines are composites as they tend to have a high stiffness high strength high fatigue resistance and low weight 52 typical resins used for these composites include polyester and epoxy while glass and carbon fibers have been used for the reinforcing material 53 construction may use manual layup techniques or composite resin injection molding as the price of glass fibers is only about one tenth the price of carbon fiber glass fiber is still dominant one of the predominant ways wind turbines have gain performance is by increasing rotor diameters and thus blade length longer blades place more demands on the strength and stiffness of the materials stiffness is especially important to avoid having blades flex to the degree that they hit the tower of the wind turbine carbon fiber is between 4 and 6 times stiffer than glass fiber 54 so carbon fiber is becoming more common in wind turbine blades 55 materials for wind turbine parts other than the rotor blades including the rotor hub gearbox frame and tower are largely composed of steel smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components in an effort to make the turbines more lightweight and efficient and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and strength properties can be improved prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower but still requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine additionally step-up gear boxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines 52 in particular this would require an increased supply of the rare earth metal neodymium reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as china has been main producer of rare earth minerals  96 in 2009 and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials 56 in recent years however other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and china has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale 57 wind turbines on public displayedit a few localities have exploited the attention-getting nature of wind turbines by placing them on public display either with visitor centers around their bases or with viewing areas farther away 58 the wind turbines are generally of conventional horizontal-axis three-bladed design and generate power to feed electrical grids but they also serve the unconventional roles of technology demonstration public relations and education small wind turbinesedit small wind turbines may be used for a variety of applications including on- or off-grid residences telecom towers offshore platforms rural schools and clinics remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid or where the grid is unstable small wind turbines may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use hybrid solar and wind powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage particularly in rural locations as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point 59 the us department of energys national renewable energy laboratory nrel defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts 60 small units often have direct drive generators direct current output aeroelastic blades lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind larger more costly turbines generally have geared power trains alternating current output flaps and are actively pointed into the wind direct drive generators and aeroelastic blades for large wind turbines are being researched wind turbine spacingedit on most horizontal windturbine farms a spacing of about 6-10 times the rotor diameter is often upheld however for large wind farms distances of about 15 rotor diameters should be more economically optimal taking into account typical wind turbine and land costs this conclusion has been reached by research 61 conducted by charles meneveau of the johns hopkins university 62 and johan meyers of leuven university in belgium based on computer simulations 63 that take into account the detailed interactions among wind turbines wakes as well as with the entire turbulent atmospheric boundary layer moreover recent research by john dabiri of caltech suggests that vertical wind turbines may be placed much more closely together so long as an alternating pattern of rotation is created allowing blades of neighbouring turbines to move in the same direction as they approach one another 64 operabilityedit maintenanceedit wind turbines need regular maintenance to stay reliable and available reaching 98 65 66 modern turbines usually have a small onboard crane for hoisting maintenance tools and minor components however large heavy components like generator gearbox blades and so on are rarely replaced and a heavy lift external crane is needed in those cases if the turbine has a difficult access road a containerized crane can be lifted up by the internal crane to provide heavier lifting 67 repoweringedit installation of new wind turbines can be controversial an alternative is repowering where existing wind turbines are replaced with bigger more powerful ones sometimes in smaller numbers while keeping or increasing capacity demolitionedit older turbines were in some early cases not required to be removed when reaching the end of their life some still stand waiting to be recycled or repowered 68 69 a demolition industry develops to recycle offshore turbines at a cost of dkk 2‚Äì4 million per mw to be guaranteed by the owner 70 recordsedit see alsoedit renewable energy portal sustainable development portal compact
