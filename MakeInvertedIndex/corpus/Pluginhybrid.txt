wind carbon-neutral fuel electric vehicle fossil fuel phase-out green vehicle plug-in hybrid renewable energy portal environment portal v t e a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle phev is a hybrid electric vehicle that uses rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device that can be recharged by plugging it in to an external source of electric power a phev shares the characteristics both of a conventional hybrid electric vehicle having an electric motor and an internal combustion engine ice and of an all-electric vehicle having a plug to connect to the electrical grid most phevs are passenger cars but there are also phev versions of commercial vehicles and vans utility trucks buses trains motorcycles scooters and military vehicles the cost of electricity to power plug-in hybrids for all-electric operation has been estimated at less than one quarter of the cost of gasoline in california 3 compared to conventional vehicles phevs produce less air pollution locally and require less petroleum phevs may produce less in the way of greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming 4 5 than conventional vehicles do phevs also eliminate the problem of range anxiety associated with all-electric vehicles because the combustion engine works as a backup when the batteries are depleted giving phevs driving-range comparable to that of other vehicles that have gasoline and diesel tanks 6 7 8 plug-in hybrids use no fossil fuel at the point of use during their all-electric range plug-in hybrids greenhouse-gas emissions during the operating in the all-electric range mode depends on the type of power plant used to feed the electrical grid when the battery is charged 9 see greenhouse gas emissions below if the batteries are charged directly from renewable sources off the electrical grid then the tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions are zero when running only on battery power other benefits include improved national energy security less frequent fill-ups at the filling station the convenience of home recharging opportunities to provide emergency backup power in the home and vehicle-to-grid v2g applications 10 11 several countries including the united states china and several european countries have enacted laws to ease the introduction of phevs through grants and tax credits emissions mandates and financing research and development in advanced batteries

terminologyedit a plug-in hybrids all-electric range is designated by phev-miles or phevkilometerskm in which the number represents the distance the vehicle can travel on battery power alone for example a phev-20 can travel twenty miles  32km without using its combustion engine so it may also be designated as a phev32km 23 the energy independence and security act of 2007 defines a plug-in electric drive vehicle as a vehicle that draws motive power from a battery with a capacity of at least 4 kilowatt hours can be recharged from an external source of electricity for motive power and is a light- medium- or heavy-duty motor vehicle or nonroad vehicle this distinguishes phevs from regular hybrid cars mass marketed today which do not use any electricity from the grid the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee defines phevs similarly but also requires that the hybrid electric vehicle be able to drive at least ten miles  16km in all-electric mode phev-10 phev16km while consuming no gasoline or diesel fuel 24 the california air resources board uses the term off-vehicle charge capable ovcc to mean having the capability to charge a battery from an off-vehicle electric energy source that cannot be connected or coupled to the vehicle in any manner while the vehicle is being driven 25 other popular terms sometimes used for plug-in hybrids are grid-connected hybrids gas-optional hybrid electric vehicle go-hev or simply gas-optional hybrids 26 27 28 general motors calls its chevrolet volt series plug-in hybrid an extended-range electric vehicle 11 29 historyedit invention and early interestedit the lohner-porsche mixte hybrid produced as early as 1899 was the first hybrid electric car 30 31 early hybrids could be charged from an external source before operation however the term plug-in hybrid has come to mean a hybrid vehicle that can be charged from a standard electrical wall socket the term plug-in hybrid electric vehicle was coined by uc davis professor andrew frank 32 who has been called the father of the modern plug-in hybrid 33 34 35 the july 1969 issue of popular science featured an article on the general motors xp-883 plug-in hybrid the concept commuter vehicle housed six 12-volt leadacid batteries in the trunk area and a transverse-mounted dc electric motor turning a front-wheel drive the car could be plugged into a standard north american 120 volt ac outlet for recharging 36 revival of interestedit in 2003 renault began selling the electroad a plug-in series hybrid version of their popular kangoo in europe it was sold alongside renaults electricit√© electric-drive kangoo battery electric van the electroad had a 150km  93mi range using a nickel-cadmium battery pack and a 500cc  31cuin 16 kilowatt liquid-cooled gasoline range-extender engine it powered two high voltagehigh outputlow volume alternators each of which supplied up to 5.5 kw at 132 volts at 5000 rpm 37 the operating speed of the internal combustion engineand therefore the output delivered by the generatorsvaried according to demand the fuel tank had a capacity of 10 liters  2.6usgal 2.2impgal and was housed within the right rear wheel arch the range extender function was activated by a switch on the dashboard the on-board 3.5 kilowatt charger could charge a depleted battery pack to 95 charge in about four hours from a 240 volts supply 38 passenger compartment heating was powered by the battery pack as well as an auxiliary coolant circuit that was supplied by the range extender engine after selling about 500 vehicles primarily in france norway and the uk at a price of about ‚Ç¨25,000 37 the electroad was redesigned in 2007 in september 2004 calcars converted a 2004 toyota prius into a prototype of what it called the prius with the addition of 130 kg  300 lb of leadacid batteries the prius achieved roughly double the fuel economy of a standard prius and could make trips of up to 15km  9mi using only electric power the vehicle which is owned by calcars technical lead ron gremban is used in daily driving as well as a test bed for various improvements to the system 39 on july 18 2006 toyota announced that it plans to develop a hybrid vehicle that will run locally on batteries charged by a household electrical outlet before switching over to a gasoline engine for longer hauls 40 in april 2007 toyota said it planned to migrate to lithium-ion batteries in future hybrid models 41 but not in the 2009 model year prius 42 lithium-ion batteries are expected to significantly improve fuel economy and have a higher energy-to-weight ratio but cost more to produce and raise safety concerns due to high operating temperatures 42 on november 29 2006 gm announced plans to introduce a production plug-in hybrid version of saturns greenline vue suv with an all-electric range of 10mi  16km 43 gm announced in january 2007 that contracts had been awarded to two companies to design and test lithium-ion batteries for the vehicle 44 but the saturn line was discontinued before the hybrid vue could be released gm has said that they plan on introducing plug-in and other hybrids for the next several years 43 in january 2007 gm unveiled the prototype of the chevrolet volt which was expected to feature a plug-in capable battery-dominant series hybrid architecture called e-flex 45 future e-flex plug-in hybrid vehicles may use gasoline diesel or hydrogen fuel cell power to supplement the vehicles battery general motors envisions an eventual progression of e-flex vehicles from plug-in hybrids to pure electric vehicles as battery technology improves 46 on july 25 japans ministry of land infrastructure and transport certified toyotas plug-in hybrid for use on public roads making it the first automobile to attain such approval toyota plans to conduct road tests to verify its all-electric range the prius plug-in hybrid was said to have an all-electric range of 13km  8mi 47 on august 9 2007 general motors vice-president robert lutz announced that gm is on track for chevrolet volt road testing in 2008 and production to begin by 2010 48 the volt was designed with all-electric range of 40mi  64km on september 5 quantum technologies and fisker coachbuild llc announced the launch of a joint venture in fisker automotive 49 fisker intended to build a us$80,000 luxury phev-50 the fisker karma initially scheduled for late 2009 50 in september 2007 aptera motors announced their typ-1 two-seater they planned to produce both an electric 2e and a plug-in series hybrid 2h with a common three-wheeled composite body design as of 2009 over two thousand hybrid pre-orders had been accepted and production of the hybrid configuration was expected to begin in 2010 51 however the company folded in december 2011 52 on october 9 2007 chinese manufacturer byd automobile company which is owned by chinas largest mobile phone battery maker announced that it would be introducing a production phev-60 sedan in china in the second half of 2008 byd exhibited it january 2008 at the north american international auto show in detroit based on byds midsize f6 sedan it uses lithium iron phosphate lifep04-based batteries instead of lithium-ion and can be recharged to 70 of capacity in just 10 minutes 53 in december 2007 ford delivered the first ford escape plug-in hybrid of a fleet of 20 demonstration phevs to southern california edison 54 as part of this demonstration program ford also developed the first ever flexible-fuel plug-in hybrid suv which was delivered in june 2008 55 this demonstration fleet of plug-ins has been in field testing with utility company fleets in the us and canada 56 and during the first two years since the program began the fleet has logged more than 75,000 miles 57 in august 2009 ford delivered the first escape plug-in equipped with intelligent vehicle-to-grid v2g communications and control system technology and ford plans to equip all 21 plug-in hybrid escapes with the vehicle-to-grid communications technology 57 sales of the escape phev are scheduled for 2012 56 on january 14 2008 toyota announced they would start sales of lithium-ion battery phevs by 2010 58 59 but later in the year toyota indicated they would be offered to commercial fleets in 2009 60 on march 27 the california air resources board modified their regulations requiring automobile manufacturers to produce 58,000 plug-in hybrids during 2012 through 2014 61 this requirement is an asked-for alternative to an earlier mandate to produce 25,000 pure zero-emissions vehicles reducing that requirement to 5,000 62 on june 26 volkswagen announced that they would be introducing production plug-ins based on the golf compact volkswagen uses the term twindrive to denote a phev 63 in september mazda was reported to be planning phevs 64 on september 23 chrysler announced that they had prototyped a plug-in jeep wrangler and a chrysler town and country mini-van both phev-40s with series powertrains and an all-electric dodge sports car and said that one of the three vehicles would go into production 65 66 on october 3 the us enacted the energy improvement and extension act of 2008 the legislation provided tax credits for the purchase of plug-in electric vehicles of battery capacity over 4 kilowatt-hours 67 68 the federal tax credits were extended and modified by the american clean energy and security act of 2009 but now the battery capacity must be over 5 kwh and the credit phases out after the automaker has sold at least 200,000 vehicles in the us 69 series productionedit on december 15 2008 byd auto began selling its f3dm in china becoming the first production plug-in hybrid sold in the world though initially was available only for corporate and government customers 12 13 14 sales to the general public began in shenzhen in march 2010 15 16 but because the f3dm nearly doubles the price of cars that run on conventional fuel byd expects subsidies from the local government to make the plug-in affordable to personal buyers 15 a global demonstration program involving 600 toyota prius plug-in pre-production test cars began in late 2009 in japan and by mid-2010 field testing had begun in france germany the united kingdom canada and the united states 70 71 72 73 74 75 volvo cars in a joint venture with vattenfall a

becoming the fourth plug-in hybrid to pass that mark 121 in june 2016 nissan announced it will introduce a compact range extender car in japan before march 2017 the series plug-in hybrid will use a new hybrid system dubbed e-power which debuted with the nissan gripz concept crossover showcased at the 2015 frankfurt auto show 122 technologyedit powertrainsedit phevs are based on the same three basic powertrain architectures as conventional electric hybrids 123 series hybrids use an internal combustion engine ice to turn a generator which in turn supplies current to an electric motor which then rotates the vehicles drive wheels a battery or supercapacitor pack or a combination of the two can be used to store excess charge examples of series hybrids vehicles include the chevrolet volt first generation fisker karma renault kangoo electroad toyotas japan-only coaster light-duty passenger bus daimler ags hybrid orion bus opel flextreme concept car swissauto rex vw polo 124 prototype and many diesel-electric locomotives with an appropriate balance of components this type can operate over a substantial distance with its full range of power without engaging the ice as is the case for other architectures series hybrids can operate without recharging as long as there is liquid fuel in the tank 125 parallel hybrids such as hondas insight civic and accord hybrids can simultaneously transmit power to their drive wheels from two distinct sourcesfor example an internal combustion engine and a battery-powered electric drive although most parallel hybrids incorporate an electric motor between the vehicles engine and transmission a parallel hybrid can also use its engine to drive one of the vehicles axles while its electric motor drives the other axle andor a generator used for recharging the batteries this type is called a road-coupled hybrid the audi duo plug-in hybrid concept car is an example of this type of parallel hybrid architecture parallel hybrids can be programmed to use the electric motor to substitute for the ice at lower power demands as well as to substantially increase the power available to a smaller ice both of which substantially increase fuel economy compared to a simple ice vehicle 126 series-parallel hybrids have the flexibility to operate in either series or parallel mode hybrid powertrains currently used by ford lexus nissan chevrolet and toyota which some refer to as series-parallel with power-split can operate in both series and parallel mode at the same time as of 2007 most plug-in hybrid conversions of conventional hybrids utilize this architecture 127 the toyota prius plug-in hybrid operates as a series-parallel hybrid 128 charging systemsedit batteries are dc devices while grid power is ac in order to charge the batteries a dc charger must be utilized the charger can be located in several locations on-board chargers are mounted inside the vehicle since the charger takes up space and adds weight its power capacity is generally limited by practical considerations avoiding carrying a more powerful charger that can only be fully utilized at certain locations however carrying the charger along with the vehicle ensures that power will be available anywhere a power connection can be found off-board chargers can be as large as needed and mounted at fixed locations like the garage or dedicated charging stations built with dedicated wiring these chargers can handle much more power and charge the batteries more quickly however as the output of these chargers is dc each battery system requires the output to be changed for that car modern charging stations have a system for identifying the voltage of the battery pack and adjusting accordingly using electric motors inverter allows the motor windings to act as the transformer coils and the existing high-power inverter as the ac-to-dc charger as these components are already required on the car and are designed to handle any practical power capability they can be used to create a very powerful form of on-board charger with zero additional weight or size ac propulsion uses this charging method referred to as reductive charging 129 modes of operationedit regardless of its architecture a plug-in hybrid may be capable of charge-depleting and charge-sustaining modes combinations of these two modes are termed blended mode or mixed-mode these vehicles can be designed to drive for an extended range in all-electric mode either at low speeds only or at all speeds these modes manage the vehicles battery discharge strategy and their use has a direct effect on the size and type of battery required 130 charge-depleting mode allows a fully charged phev to operate exclusively or depending on the vehicle almost exclusively except during hard acceleration on electric power until its battery state of charge is depleted to a predetermined level at which time the vehicles internal combustion engine or fuel cell will be engaged this period is the vehicles all-electric range this is the only mode that a battery electric vehicle can operate in hence their limited range 131 charge-sustaining mode is used by production hybrid vehicles hevs today and combines the operation of the vehicles two power sources in such a manner that the vehicle is operating as efficiently as possible without allowing the battery state of charge to move outside a predetermined narrow band over the course of a trip in a hev the state of charge may fluctuate but will have no net change 133 the battery in a hev can thus be thought of as an energy accumulator rather than a fuel storage device once a plug-in hybrid has exhausted its all-electric range in charge-depleting mode it can switch into charge-sustaining mode automatically mixed mode describes a trip in which a combination of the above modes are utilized 134 for example a phev-20 prius conversion may begin a trip with 5 miles  8km of low speed charge-depleting then get onto a freeway and operate in blended mode for 20 miles  32km using 10 miles  16km worth of all-electric range at twice the fuel economy finally the driver might exit the freeway and drive for another 5 miles  8km without the internal combustion engine until the full 20 miles  32km of all-electric range are exhausted at this point the vehicle can revert to a charge sustaining-mode for another 10 miles  16km until the final destination is reached such a trip would be considered a mixed mode as multiple modes are employed in one trip this contrasts with a charge-depleting trip which would be driven within the limits of a phevs all-electric range conversely the portion of a trip which extends beyond the all-electric range of a phev would be driven primarily in charge-sustaining mode as used by a conventional hybrid electric power storageedit phevs typically require deeper battery charging and discharging cycles than conventional hybrids because the number of full cycles influences battery life this may be less than in traditional hevs which do not deplete their batteries as fully however some authors argue that phevs will soon become standard in the automobile industry 135 design issues and trade-offs against battery life capacity heat dissipation weight costs and safety need to be solved 136 advanced battery technology is under development promising greater energy densities by both mass and volume 137 and battery life expectancy is expected to increase 138 the cathodes of some early 2007 lithium-ion batteries are made from lithium-cobalt metal oxide this material is expensive and cells made with it can release oxygen if overcharged if the cobalt is replaced with iron phosphates the cells will not burn or release oxygen under any charge the price premium for early 2007 conventional hybrids is about us$5000 some us$3000 of which is for their nimh battery packs at early 2007 gasoline and electricity prices that would mean a break-even point after six to ten years of operation the conventional hybrid premium could fall to us$2000 in five years with us$1200 or more of that being cost of lithium-ion batteries providing for a three-year payback the payback period may be longer for plug-in hybrids because of their larger more expensive batteries 139 nickelmetal hydride and lithium-ion batteries can be recycled toyota for example has a recycling program in place under which dealers are paid a us$200 credit for each battery returned 140 however plug-in hybrids typically use larger battery packs than comparable conventional hybrids and thus require more resources pacific gas and electric company pge has suggested that utilities could purchase used batteries for backup and load leveling purposes they state that while these used batteries may be no longer usable in vehicles their residual capacity still has significant value 141 more recently general motors gm has said it has been approached by utilities interested in using recycled volt batteries as a power storage system a secondary market that could bring down the cost of the volt and other plug-in vehicles for consumers 142 lithium iron phosphate lifepo4 is a class of cathode materials used in lithium iron phosphate batteries that is getting attention from the auto industry valence technologies produce a lithium iron manganese phosphate lifemnpo4 battery with lg chem selling lithium iron phosphate lifepo4 batteries for the chevy volt and a123 produces a lithium nano-phosphate battery the most important merit of this battery type is safety and high-power lithium iron phosphate batteries are one of three major types in lfp family the other two being nano-phosphate and nano-cocrystalline-olivine in france √©lectricit√© de france edf and toyota are installing charging stations for phevs on roads streets and parking lots 143 edf is also partnering with elektromotive ltd 144 to install 250 new charging points over six months from october 2007 in london and elsewhere in the uk 145 recharging points also can be installed for specific uses as in taxicab stands project better place began in october 2007 and is working with renault on development of exchangeable batteries battery swapping 146 ultracapacitors or supercapacitors are used in some plug-in hybrids such as afs trinitys concept prototype to store rapidly available energy with their high power density in order to keep batteries within safe resistive heating limits and extend battery life 147 148 the csiros ultrabattery combines a supercapacitor and a lead acid battery in a single unit creating a hybrid car battery that lasts longer costs less and is more powerful than current technologies used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles phevs 149 the optimum battery size varies depending on whether the aim is to reduce oil consumption running costs or emissions but a recent study 150 concluded that the best choice of phev battery capacity depends critically on the distance that the vehicle will be driven between charges our results suggest that for urban driving conditions and frequent charges every 10 miles or less a low-capacity phev sized with an aer all electric range of about 7 miles would be a robust choice for minimizing gasoline consumption cost and greenhouse gas emissions for less frequent charging every 20‚Äì100 miles phevs release fewer ghgs but hevs are more cost effective  conversions of production vehiclesedit conversion of fossil-fuel vehiclesedit retrofit electrification requires only one-fifth the energy required to build a new vehicle this is called acev-to-phev conversion 151 there are several companies that are converting fossil fuel non-hybrid vehicles also called all-combustion engine vehicles to plug-in hybrids 152 153 colorado is going to offer $6,000 credit for phev conversions in addition to a federal 10 credit up to $4,000 for qualifying vehicles 154 conversions of production hybridsedit aftermarket conversion of an existing production hybrid a charge-maintaining hybrid to a plug-in hybrid called chev-to-phev conversion 151 typically involves increasing the capacity of the vehicles battery pack and adding an on-board ac-to-dc charger ideally the vehicles powertrain software would be reprogrammed to make full use of the battery packs additional energy storage capacity and power output many early plug-in hybrid electric vehicle conversions have been based on the 2004 or later model toyota prius 155 some of the systems have involved replacement of the vehicles original nimh battery pack and its electronic control unit others such as a123 hymotion the calcars prius and the piprius piggyback an additional battery back onto the original battery pack this is also referred to as battery range extender modules brems 156 within the electric vehicle conversion community this has been referred to as a hybrid battery pack configuration 157 early leadacid battery conversions by calcars demonstrated 10 miles  15 km of ev-only and 20 miles  30 km of double mileage blended mode range 39 edrive systems use valence technology li-ion batteries and have a claimed 40 to 50 miles  64 to 80 km of electric range 158 other companies offering plug-in conversions or kits for the toyota prius some of them also for ford escape hybrid include hymotion hybrids plus manzanita micro and oemtek breez phev-30 159 afs trinitys xh-150 claims that it has created a functioning plug-in hybrid with a 40 miles  64km all-electric range and that it has solved the overheating problem that rapid acceleration can cause in phevs and extend battery life 147 148 the eaa-phev project was conceived by calcars and the electric auto association in october 2005 to accelerate efforts to document existing hevs and their potential for conversion into phevs 160 it includes a conversion interest page 161 the electric auto association-phev do-it-yourself open source communitys primary focus is to provide conversion instructions to help guide experienced converters through the process and to provide a common design that could demonstrate multiple battery technologies many members of organizations such as calcars and the eaa as well as companies like hybrids plus hybrid interfaces of canada and manzanita micro participate in the development of the project plug-in supply inc of petaluma california offers components and assemblies to build the prius the plug-in conversion invented by calcars 162 their leadacid battery box assembly forms a complete install package providing access to the spare tire and containing twenty 12 volt leadacid batteries and all high voltage components and control electronics the pba battery box assembly is also available without batteries it provides about 10 miles  16km of ev mode range 163 conversion time was reduced by plug-in supply to one day oemtek offers a valence powered lithium iron phosphate conversion that should provide 50 miles  80km of all-electric range the motor industry research association has announced a retrofit hybrid conversion kit that provides removable battery packs that plug into a wall outlet for charging 164 poulsen hybrid is developing a conversion kit that will add through-the-road plug-in hybrid capability to conventional vehicles by externally mounting electric motors onto two of the wheels 165 md-tech offers a phev kit for hybrid vehicles that acts as a hybrid battery re-chargercitation needed the kit supplies power to the hybrid battery without modifying the powertrain of the hybrid vehicle it fits into the back of a hybrid vehicle originally designed to fit under the rear floor of a toyota prius the kit uses lithium iron phosphate cells in a battery supplying 4kwh of energy this gives it a range of 30km in charge-depleting ev mode and provides a boost of power in blended mode the battery charger uses mains electricity and takes 4‚Äì5 hours to charge the battery supplies power to the dc to dc boost converter which regulates power to the hybrid battery the converter output can be adjusted to set voltage and current output a proprietary battery management system uses active battery balancing to monitor the battery state of health enginer inc of troy michigan offers universal plugin conversion kits with components and assemblies to build two stage hybrid battery systemcitation needed their lithium-ion battery box assembly forms a complete install package providing access to the spare tire and containing 16/32 lithium phosphate battery cells a dcdc converter a bms and a charger it provides about 10 miles  16km of ev mode range for under $2000  2kwh model longer range 4kwh model is also available for $1000 more conversion time was reduced to twothree hours target marketedit with the exception of tesla motors demand for all-electric vehicles especially in the us market has been driven by government incentivescitation needed in particular american sales of the nissan leaf have depended on generous incentives and special treatment in the state of georgia the top selling leaf market 166 according to international market research 60 of respondents believe a battery driving range of less than 160km  99mi is unacceptable even though only 2 drive more than that distance per day 167 among popular current all-electric vehicles only the tesla with the most expensive version of the model s offering a 265 miles  426km range in the us environmental protection agency 5-cycle test significantly exceeds this threshold the nissan leaf has an epa rated range of 75 miles  121km for the 2013 model year plug-in hybrids provide the extended range and potential for refueling of conventional hybrids while enabling drivers to utilize battery electric power for at least a significant part of their typical daily driving the average trip to or from work in the united states in 2009 was 11.8 miles  19.0km 168 while the average distance commuted to work in england and wales in 2011 was slightly lower at 9.3 miles  15km 169 since building a phev with a longer all-electric range adds weight and cost and reduces cargo andor passenger space there is not a specific all-electric range that is optimal the accompanying graph shows the observed all-electric range in miles for four popular us market plug-in hybrids as tested by popular mechanics magazine 170 a key design parameter of the chevrolet volt was a target of 40 miles  64km for the all-electric range selected to keep the battery size small and lower costs and mainly because research showed that 78 of daily commuters in the us travel 40mi  64km or less this target range would allow most travel to be accomplished electrically driven and the assumption was made that charging will take place at home overnight this requirement translated using a lithium-ion battery pack with an energy storage capacity of 16 kwh considering that the battery would be used until the state of charge soc of the battery reached 30 171 172 in october 2014 general motors reported based on data collected through its onstar telematics system since volt deliveries began and with over 1 billion miles  1.6 billion km traveled that volt owners drive about 62.5 of their trips in all-electric mode 173 in may 2016 ford reported based on data collected from more than 610 million miles  976 million km logged by its electrified vehicles through its telematics system that drivers of these vehicles run an average of 13,500 miles  21,700km annually on their vehicles with about half of those miles operating in all-electric mode a break down of these figures show an average daily commute of 42mi  68km for ford energi plug-in hybrid drivers ford notes that with the enhanced electric range of the 2017 model year model the average fusion energi commuter could go the entire day using no gasoline if the car is fully charged both before leaving for work and before leaving for home according to ford data currently most customers are likely charging their vehicles only at home 174 the 2015 edition of the epas annual report light-duty automotive technology carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy trends estimates the following utility factors for 2015 model year plug-in hybrids to represent the percentage of miles that will be driven using electricity by an average driver whether in electric only or blended modes 83 for the bmw i3 rex 66 for the chevrolet volt 45 for the ford energi models 43 for the mclaren p1 37 for the bmw i8 and 29 for the toyota prius phv 175 a 2014 analysis conducted by the idaho national laboratory using a sample of 21,600 all-electric cars and plug-in hybrids found that volt owners traveled on average 9,112 miles in all-electric mode e-miles per year while leaf owners traveled 9,697 e-miles per year despite the volts shorter all-electric range about half of the leafs 176 between january and august 2014 a period during which us sales of conventional hybrids slowed us sales of plug-in hybrids grew from 28,241 to 40,748 compared to the same period in 2013 us sales of all-electric vehicles also grew during the same period from 29,917 vehicles in the january to august 2013 period to 40,349 in january to august 2014 177 advantagesedit fuel efficiency and petroleum displacementedit each kilowatt hour of battery capacity in use will displace up to 50 us gallons  190l 42impgal of petroleum fuels per year gasoline or diesel fuels 178 also electricity is multi-sourced and as a result it gives the greatest degree of energy resilience 179 the actual fuel economy for phevs depends on their powertrain operating modes their all-electric range and the amount of driving between charges if no gasoline is used the miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpg-e depends only on the efficiency of the electric system the first mass production phev available in the us market the 2011 chevrolet volt with an epa rated all-electric range of 35 miles  56km and an additional gasoline-only extended range of 344 miles  554km has an epa combined cityhighway fuel economy of 93 mpg-e in all-electric mode and 37mpg-us  6.4l/100km 44mpg-imp in gasoline-only mode for an overall combined gas-electric fuel economy rating of 60mpg-us  3.9l/100km 72mpg-imp equivalent mpg-e 180 181 the epa also included in the volts fuel economy label a table showing fuel economy and electricity consumed for five different scenarios 30 45 60 and 75 miles  121km driven between a full charge and a never charge scenario 181 according to this table the fuel economy goes up to 168mpg-us  1.40l/100km 202mpg-imp equivalent mpg-e with 45 miles  72km driven between full charges 180 for the more comprehensive fuel economy and environment label that will be mandatory in the us beginning in model year 2013 the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa and environmental protection agency epa issued two separate fuel economy labels for plug-in hybrids because of their design complexity as phevs can operate in two or three operating modes all-electric blended and gasoline-only 182 183 one label is for series hybrid or extended range electric vehicle like the chevy volt with all-electric and gasoline-only modes and a second label for blended mode or series-parallel hybrid that includes a combination of both gasoline and plug-in electric operation and gasoline only like a conventional hybrid vehicle 182 183 a further advantage of phevs is that they have potential to be even more efficient than conventional hybrids because a more limited use of the phevs internal combustion engine may allow the engine to be used at closer to its maximum efficiency while a prius is likely to convert fuel to motive energy on average at about 30 efficiency well below the engines 38 peak efficiency the engine of a phev-70 would be likely to operate far more often near its peak efficiency because the batteries can serve the modest power needs at times when the combustion engine would be forced to run well below its peak efficiency 131 the actual efficiency achieved depends on losses from electricity generation inversion battery chargingdischarging the motor controller and motor itself the way a vehicle is used its duty cycle and the opportunities to recharge by connecting to the electrical grid the society of automotive engineers sae developed their recommended practice in 1999 for testing and reporting the fuel economy of hybrid vehicles and included language to address phevs an sae committee is currently working to review procedures for testing and reporting the fuel economy of phevs 184 the toronto atmospheric fund tested ten retrofitted plug-in hybrid vehicles that achieved an average of 5.8 litres per 100 kilometre or 40.6 miles per gallon over six months in 2008 which was considered below the technologys potential 185 phev batteries also allow for an additional efficiency when converting solar power directly into a dc storage system as opposed to converting the energy into ac home or building dc to dc direct conversion is more efficient therefore potentially allowing the more efficient capture of solar energy 186 in real world testing using normal drivers some prius phev conversions may not achieve much better fuel economy than hevs for example a plug-in prius fleet each with a 30 miles  48km all-electric range averaged only 51mpg-us  4.6l/100km 61mpg-imp in a 17,000-mile  27,000km test in seattle 187 and similar results with the same kind of conversion battery models at googles rechargeit initiative moreover the additional battery pack costs us$10,000us$11,000 188 189 operating costsedit the following table compares epas estimated out-of-pocket fuel costs and fuel economy ratings of serial production plug-in hybrid electric vehicles rated by epa as of october 2016update expressed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpg-e 190 versus the most fuel efficient gasoline-electric hybrid car the 2016 toyota prius eco fourth generation rated 56mpg-us  4.2l/100km 67mpg-imp and epas average new 2016 vehicle which has a fuel economy of 25mpg-us  9.4l/100km 30mpg-imp 190 191 192 the table also shows the fuel efficiency for plug-in hybrids in all-electric mode expressed as kwh/100 mile the metric used by epa to rate electric cars before november 2010 193 a study published in 2014 by researchers from lamar university iowa state university and oak ridge national laboratory compared the operating costs of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles phevs of various electric ranges  10 20 30 and 40 miles with conventional gasoline vehicles and hybrid-electric vehicles hevs for different payback periods considering different charging infrastructure deployment levels and gasoline prices the study concluded that 224 phevs save around 60 or 40 in energy costs compared with conventional gasoline vehicles and hevs respectively however for drivers with significant daily vehicle miles traveled dvmt hybrid vehicles may be even a better choice than plug-in hybrids with a range of 40mi  64km particularly when there is lack of public charging infrastructure the incremental battery cost of large-battery plug-in hybrids is difficult to justify based on the incremental savings of phevs operating costs unless a subsidy is offered for large-battery phevs when the price of gasoline increases from us$4 per gallon to us$5 per gallon the number of drivers who benefit from a larger battery increases significantly if the gas price is us$3 a plug-in hybrid with a range of 10mi  16km is the least costly option even if the battery cost is $200kw although quick chargers can reduce charging time they contribute little to energy cost savings for phevs as opposed to level-2 chargers range anxiety eliminationedit one of the main barriers for the general adoption of all-electric cars is the range anxiety factor the drivers fear of being stranded by a depleted battery before reaching the final destination 225 226 plug-in hybrids as opposed to pure electric cars eliminate the range anxiety concerns because the gasoline engine serves as a back-up to recharge the battery to provide electric power to the electric motor or to provide propulsion directly access to a regular fuel station guarantees that a phev has similar driving ranges as conventional gasoline-powered automobile 225 227 as of 2016update there are five plug-in hybrids in the european market capable of driving around 50km  31mi under nedc cycle on the battery alone the audi a3 e-tron mitsubishi outlander p-hev volkswagen golf gte volkswagen passat gte and volvo v60 plug-in hybrid 228 other models with larger all-electric range are the chevrolet volt and cadillac elr sold in the us and canada and the bmw i3 rex available in 49 countries 229 230 as a response to range anxiety concerns bmw is offering an optional limited capability gasoline range extender engine for its all-electric bmw i3 230 the range-extender option costs an additional us$3,850 in the united states 231 ‚Ç¨4,710  us$6,300 in france 232 and ‚Ç¨4,490  us$6,000 in the netherlands 233 the range-extender option of the bmw i3 was designed to meet the california air resources board carb regulation for an auxiliary power unit apu called rex according to rules adopted in march 2012 by carb the 2014 bmw i3 with a rex unit fitted will be the first car to qualify as a range-extended battery-electric vehicle or bevx carb describes this type of electric vehicle as a relatively high-electric range battery-electric vehicle bev to which an apu is added the unit which maintains battery charge at about 30 after the pack has been depleted in normal use is strictly limited in the additional range it can provide 234 according to bmw at the beginning of the i3 release the use of range-extender was much more than the carmaker expected more than 60 over time it has decreased significantly with some people almost never using it and by 2016 it is being regularly used in fewer than 5 of i3s 235 in early october 2014 general motors reported based on data collected through its onstar telematics system that volt owners in north america have accumulated a total of 1 billion miles  1.6 billion km traveled of which about 62.5 were driven in all-electric mode 236 a similar report issued by gm in august 2016 reported that volt owners have accumulated almost 1.5 billion miles  2.4 billion km driven in ev mode representing 60 of their total miles traveled 237 in a study published in june 2016 conducted by the norwegian institute of transport economics the researchers found that plug-in hybrid owners in norway drive on average 55 of their annual distance in charge-depleting or all-electric mode ev mode and the share goes up to about 63 for work trips the share of electric travel is higher for trips to work and in the summer and lower in the winter the average plug-in hybrid user in the survey drives 60 of the total distance in ev mode in the summer and 53 in winter the estimate for work trips is higher at 70 in the summer and 59 in winter 238 one of the advantages of the plug-in hybrid design is that the generator can be completely decoupled from the traction unlike a conventional engine which operates over a wide variety of power settings and operational conditions the range extender can be operated under optimum conditions at all times high-efficiency power sources that are not suitable for normal automotive use may be perfectly suitable for pev use these include advanced close-cycle steam engines stirling engines wankel engines and microturbines due primarily to their light weight and small sizecitation needed smogedit the ontario medical association announced that smog is responsible for an estimated 9,500 premature deaths in its province every year 239 plug-in hybrids in emission-free electric mode may contribute to the reduction of smog 185 vehicle-to-grid electricityedit phevs and fully electric cars may allow for more efficient use of existing electric production capacity much of which sits idle as operating reserve most of the time this assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during off peak periods ie at night or equipped with technology to shut off charging during periods of peak demand another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during peak loads this is accomplished with vehicle-to-grid technology by using excess battery capacity to send power back into the grid and then recharge during off peak times using cheaper power such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities as well as their owners even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of nighttime electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the daytime and provide a greater return on capital for electricity infrastructure 23 in the uk vtg would need to comply with generation connection standard g59/2 which means that it would need an earth rod at the premises and would be unable to export more than 17kw without the network firms permission which feeding onto one phase ie for a normal house would not be given - to maintain a balance of load across the three phases in october 2005 five toyota engineers and one asian aw engineer published an ieee technical paper detailing a toyota-approved project to add vehicle-to-grid capability to a toyota prius 240 although the technical paper described a method for generating voltage between respective lines of neutral points in the generator and motor of the ths-ii toyota hybrid system to add a function for generating electricity it did not state whether or not the experimental vehicle could be charged through the circuit as well however the vehicle was featured in a toyota dream house and a brochure for the exhibit stated that the house can supply electricity to the battery packs of the vehicles via the stand in the middle of the garage indicating that the vehicle may have been a plug-in hybrid 241 in november 2005 more than 50 leaders from public power utility companies across the united states met at the los angeles department of water and power headquarters to discuss plug-in hybrid and vehicle-to-grid technology the event which was sponsored by the american public power association also provided an opportunity for association members to plan strategies that public power utility companies could use to promote plug-in hybrid technology greg hanssen and peter nortman of energycs and edrive attended the two-day session and during a break in the proceedings made an impromptu display in the ladwp parking lot of their converted prius plug-in hybrid 242 in september 2006 the california air resources board held a zero emission vehicle symposium that included several presentations on v2g technology 243 in april 2007 pacific gas and electric company showcased a phev at the silicon valley leadership alternative energy solutions summit with vehicle-to-grid capability and demonstrated that it could be used as a source of emergency home power in the event of an electrical power failure 244 regulations intended to protect electricians against power other than from grid sources would need to be changed or regulations requiring consumers to disconnect from the grid when connected to non-grid sources will be required before such backup power solutions would be feasible 245 jon wellinghoff from the us federal energy regulatory commission coined the term cash-back hybrids to describe payments to car owners for putting their batteries on the power grid batteries could also be offered in low-cost leasing or renting or by donation including maintenance to the car owners by the public utilities in a vehicle-to-grid agreement 246 disadvantagesedit cost of batteriesedit disadvantages of plug-in hybrids include the additional cost weight and size of a larger battery pack according to a 2010 study by the national research council the cost of a lithium-ion battery pack is about us$1,700kwh of usable energy and considering that a phev-10 requires about 2.0kwh and a phev-40 about 8kwh the manufacturer cost of the battery pack for a phev-10 is around us$3,000 and it goes up to us$14,000 for a phev-40 247 248 according to the same study even though costs are expected to decline by 35 by 2020 market penetration is expected to be slow and therefore phevs are not expected to significantly impact oil consumption or carbon emissions before 2030 unless a fundamental breakthrough in battery technologies occurs 247 248 249 according to the 2010 nrc study although a mile driven on electricity is cheaper than one driven on gasoline lifetime fuel savings are not enough to offset plug-ins high upfront costs and it will take decades before the break even point is achieved 249 furthermore hundreds of billions of dollars in government subsidies and incentives are likely to be required to achieve a rapid plug-in market penetration in the us 248 249 a 2013 study by the american council for an energy-efficient economy reported that battery costs came down from us$1,300 per kilowatt hour in 2007 to us$500 per kilowatt hour in 2012 the us department of energy has set cost targets for its sponsored battery research of us$300 per kilowatt hour in 2015 and us$125 per kilowatt hour by 2022 cost reductions through advances in battery technology and higher production volumes will allow plug-in electric vehicles to be more competitive with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles 251 a study published in 2011 by the belfer center harvard university found that the gasoline costs savings of plug-in electric cars over the vehicles lifetimes do not offset their higher purchase prices this finding was estimated comparing their lifetime net present value at 2010 purchase and operating costs for the us market and assuming no government subidies 252 253 according to the study estimates a phev-40 is us$5,377 more expensive than a conventional internal combustion engine while a battery electric vehicle bev is us$4,819 more expensive the study also examined how this balance will change over the next 10 to 20 years assuming that battery costs will decrease while gasoline prices increase under the future scenarios considered the study found that bevs will be significantly less expensive than conventional cars us$1,155 to us$7,181 cheaper while phevs will be more expensive than bevs in almost all comparison scenarios and only less expensive than conventional cars in a scenario with very low battery costs and high gasoline prices bevs are simpler to build and do not use liquid fuel while phevs have more complicated powertrains and still have gasoline-powered engines 252 lithium iron phosphate batteries from valence technologies 254 were used in the first plug-in hybrids from calcars 255 they are providing a conversion for the toyota prius priced at us$12,000 hymotion also offers a conversion for us$10,000 but their conversion is only 5kw where oemteks is 9kw 256 recharging outside home garagesedit many authors have assumed that plug-in recharging will take place overnight at home however residents of cities apartments dormitories and townhouses might not have garages or driveways with available power outlets and they might be less likely to buy plug-ins unless recharging infrastructure is developed 257 258 electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence or in commercial or public parking lots or streets or workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of phevs 258 259 even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers 260 261 however this infrastructure is not in place today and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors 259 several cities in california and oregon and particularly san francisco and other cities in the san francisco bay area and silicon valley as well as some local private firms such as google and adobe systems already have deployed charging stations and have expansion plans to attend both plug-ins and all-electric cars 259 in googles case its mountain view campus has 100 available charging stations for its share-use fleet of converted plug-ins available to its employees 259 262 solar panels are used to generate the electricity and this pilot program is being monitored on a daily basis with performance results published on the rechargeit website 262 emissions shifted to electric plantsedit increased pollution is expected to occur in some areas with the adoption of phevs but most areas will experience a decrease 263 a study by the aceee predicts that widespread phev use in heavily coal-dependent areas would result in an increase in local net sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions given emissions levels from most coal plants currently supplying power to the grid 264 although clean coal technologies could create power plants which supply grid power from coal without emitting significant amounts of such pollutants the higher cost of the application of these technologies may increase the price of coal-generated electricity the net effect on pollution is dependent on the fuel source of the electrical grid fossil or renewable for example and the pollution profile of the power plants themselves identifying regulating and upgrading single point pollution source such as a power plantor replacing a plant altogethermay also be more practical from a human health perspective shifting pollution away from large urban areas may be considered a significant advantage 265 according to a 2009 study by the national academy of science electric vehicles and grid-dependent plug-in hybrid vehicles showed somewhat higher nonclimate damages than many other technologies 266 efficiency of plug-in hybrids is also impacted by the overall efficiency of electric power transmission transmission and distribution losses in the usa were estimated at 7.2 in 1995 267 and 6.5 in 2007 268 by life cycle analysis of air pollution emissions natural gas vehicles are currently the lowest emittercitation needed tiered rate structure for electric billsedit electric utility companies generally do not utilize flat rate pricing for example pacific gas and electric pge normally charges $0.10 per kilowatt hour kwh for the base tier but additional tiers are priced as high as $0.30 per kwh to customers without electric vehicles 269 270 some utilities offer electric vehicle users a rate tariff that provides discounts for off-peak usage such as overnight recharging pge offers a special discounted rate for plug-in and other electric vehicle customers the experimental time-of-use low emission vehicle rate 271 that tariff gives people much cheaper rates if they charge at night especially during the summer months the additional electrical utilization required to recharge the plug-in vehicles could push many households in areas that do not have off-peak tariffs into the higher priced tier and negate financial benefits 272 without an off-peak charging tariff one study of a certain phev-20 model having an all-electric range of 20 miles gasoline-fueled efficiency of 52.7migal us and all-electric efficiency of 4mikwh found that household electricity customers who consumed 131‚Äì200 of baseline electricity at $0.220kwh would see benefits if gasoline was priced above us$2.89us gal those that consumed 201‚Äì300 of baseline electricity at $0.303kwh would only see benefits if gas was priced above $3.98 and households consuming over 300 of baseline electricity at $0.346kwh would only see benefits if gasoline was priced above $4.55 usdgal 273 off-peak tariff rates can lower the break-even point the pge tariff would change those break-even gasoline prices to us$1.96 $3.17 and $3.80 per gallon respectively for the given phev and usage pattern in question customers under such tariffs could see significant savings by being careful about when the vehicle was charged for example by using a timer to restrict charging to off-peak hours thus an accurate comparison of the benefit requires each household to evaluate its current electrical usage tier and tariffs weighed against the cost of gasoline and the actual observed operational cost of electric mode vehicle operation lithium availability and supply securityedit current technology for plug-ins is based on the lithium-ion battery and an electric motor and the demand for lithium heavy metals and other rare elements such as neodymium boron and cobalt required for the batteries and powertrain is expected to grow significantly due to the incoming market entrance of plug-ins and electric vehicles in the mid and long term some of the largest world reserves of lithium and other rare metals are located in countries with strong resource nationalism unstable governments or hostile to us interests raising concerns about the risk of replacing dependence on foreign oil with a new dependence on hostile countries to supply strategic materials 275 276 277 278 even though the metals used in electric vehicle batteries are rare they can be recycled 279 fossil fuels are finite and nonrenewable 280 currently the main deposits of lithium are found in china and south america throughout the andes mountain chain in 2008 chile was the leading lithium metal producer followed by australia china and argentina 277 281 in the united states lithium is recovered from brine pools in nevada 281 282 nearly half the worlds known reserves are located in bolivia 275 277 and according to the us geological survey bolivias salar de uyuni desert has 5.4 million tons of lithium which can be used to make lithium batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles 275 281 other important reserves are located in chile china and brazil 277 281 regarding rare earth elements most reserves are located in china which controls the world market for these elements 278 hazard to pedestriansedit at low speeds electric-drive cars produced less roadway noise as compared to vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets hence plug-in electric cars and hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard 283 284 tests have shown that this is a valid concern as vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below 20mph  30kmh for all types of road users and not only the visually impaired at higher speeds the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise 284 the government of japan the us congress and the european parliament passed legislation to regulate the minimum level of sound for hybrids and plug-in electric vehicles when operating in electric mode so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching 284 285 286 287 as of march 2013update most of the hybrids and plug-in electric cars available in the united states make warning noises using a speaker system 288 greenhouse gas emissionsedit the effect of phevs on greenhouse emissions is complex plug-in hybrid vehicles operating on all-electric mode do not emit harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power the clean air benefit is usually local because depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants 289 in the same way phevs do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power but from the point of view of a well-to-wheel assessment the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation from the perspective of a full life cycle analysis the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind solar hydroelectric or nuclear power for pevs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions 289 290 on the other hand when pevs are recharged from coal-fired plants they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles 289 in the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle when operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy 290 there has been much debate over the potential ghg emissions reductions that can be achieved with phev a study by the electric power research institute reports that a 338 twh or 5.8 increase in power generation needed as a result of phev 291 in the same report the epri also states that co2 emissions could increase by 430 million metric tons 291 the article concludes a study by the american council for an energy efficient economy aceee predicts that on average a typical american driver is expected to achieve about a 15 reduction in net co 2 emissions compared to the driver of a regular hybrid based on the 2005 distribution of power sources feeding the us electrical grid 292 the aceee study also predicts that in areas where more than 80 of grid-power comes from coal-burning power plants local net co 2 emissions will increase 292 while for phevs recharged in areas where the grid is fed by power sources with lower co 2 emissions than the current average net co 2 emissions associated with phevs will decrease correspondingly a 2007 joint study by the electric power research institute epri and the natural resources defense council nrdc similarly found that the introduction of phevs into americas consumer vehicle fleet could achieve significant greenhouse gas emission reductions 4 the epri-nrdc report estimates that between 2010 and 2050 a shift toward phev use could reduce ghg emissions by 3.4 to 10.4 billion metric tons the magnitude of these reductions would ultimately depend on the level of phev market penetration and the carbon intensity of the us electricity sector in general phevs can be viewed as an element in the pacala and socolow wedges approach which shows a way to stabilize co 2 emissions using a portfolio of existing techniques including efficient vehicles a 2008 study at duke university suggests that for phevs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than hybrids a carbon pricing signal that encourages the development of low carbon power is needed 293 rand also in 2008 studied the questions of a carbon tax carbon cap and trade systems increasing gasoline tax and providing renewable energy subsidies under various economic conditions and vehicle type availabilities rand found that subsidies were able to provide a smoother transition to new energy sources especially in the face of energy source price volatility because subsidies can be structured according to relative costs between renewables and fossil fuel while taxes and carbon trading schemes alone do not take relative prices of energy into account 294 the minnesota pollution control agency found that if minnesotas fleet of vehicles making lengthy trips were replaced by plug-in hybrids co 2 emissions per vehicle would likely decrease however unless more than 40 of the electricity used to charge the vehicles were to come from non-polluting sources replacing the vehicles with non-plug-in hybrids would engender a larger decrease in co 2 emissions 295 plug-in hybrids use less fuel in all cases and produce much less carbon dioxide in short commuter trips which is how most vehicles are used the difference is such that overall carbon emissions would decrease if all internal combustion vehicles were converted to plug-ins 263 a study by kantor fowler hajimiragha and elkamel shows that fuel cell plug-in hybrid vehicles achieve twice as much reduction in greenhouse gas emissions than phevs and fcvs the study uses the transportation sector in ontario canada as a case study with the maximum allowable number of vehicles being that which can be supported by the electric grid 296 argonne national laboratoryedit in 2009 researchers at argonne national laboratory adapted their greet model to conduct a full well-to-wheels wtw analysis of energy use and greenhouse gas ghg emissions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles for several scenarios considering different on-board fuels and different sources of electricity generation for recharging the vehicle batteries three us regions were selected for the analysis california new york and illinois as these regions include major metropolitan areas with significant variations in their energy generation mixes the full cycle analysis results were also reported for the us generation mix and renewable electricity to examine cases of average and clean mixes respectively 5 this 2009 study showed a wide spread of petroleum use and ghg emissions among the different fuel production technologies and grid generation mixes the following table summarizes the main results 5 the argonne study found that phevs offered reductions in petroleum energy use as compared with regular hybrid electric vehicles more petroleum energy savings and also more ghg emissions reductions were realized as the all-electric range increased except when electricity used to recharged was dominated by coal or oil-fired power generation as expected electricity from renewable sources realized the largest reductions in petroleum energy use and ghg emissions for all phevs as the all-electric range increased the study also concluded that plug-in vehicles that employ biomass-based fuels biomass-e85 and -hydrogen may not realize ghg emissions benefits over regular hybrids if power generation is dominated by fossil sources 5 oak ridge national laboratoryedit a 2008 study by researchers at oak ridge national laboratory analyzed oil use and greenhouse gas ghg emissions of plug-in hybrids relative to hybrid electric vehicles under several scenarios for years 2020 and 2030 each type of vehicle was assumed to run 20 miles  32km per day and the hev was assumed to have a fuel economy of 40 miles per us gallon  5.9l/100km 48mpg-imp 299 the study considered the mix of power sources for 13 us regions generally a combination of coal natural gas and nuclear energy and to a lesser extend renewable energy 299 300 a 2010 study conducted at argonne national laboratory reached similar findings concluding that phevs will reduce oil consumption but could produce very different greenhouse gas emissions for each region depending on the energy mix used to generate the electricity to recharge the plug-in hybrids 301 302 the following table summarizes the main results of the oak ridge national laboratory study for the 2020 scenario environmental protection agencyedit in october 2014 the us environmental protection agency published the 2014 edition of its annual report light-duty automotive technology carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy trends for the first time the report presents an analysis of the impact of alternative fuel vehicles with emphasis in plug-in electric vehicles because as their market share is approaching 1 pevs began to have a measurable impact on the us overall new vehicle fuel economy and co2 emissions 199 304 epas report included the analysis of 12 all-electric passengers cars and 10 plug-in hybrids available in the market as model year 2014 for purposes of an accurate estimation of emissions the analysis took into consideration the differences in operation between those phevs like the chevrolet volt that can operate in all-electric mode without using gasoline and those that operate in a blended mode like the toyota prius phv which uses both energy stored in the battery and energy from the gasoline tank to propel the vehicle but that can deliver substantial all-electric driving in blended mode in addition since the all-electric range of plug-in hybrids depends on the size of the battery pack the analysis introduced a utility factor as a projection on average of the percentage of miles that will be driven using electricity in electric only and blended modes by an average driver the following table shows the overall evhybrid fuel economy expressed in terms of miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpg-e and the utility factor for the ten my2014 plug-in hybrids available in the us market the study used the utility factor since in pure ev mode there are no tailpipe emissions and the epa best estimate of the co2 tailpipe emissions produced by these vehicles in real world city and highway operation based on the epa 5-cycle label methodology using a weighted 55 city/45 highway driving the results are shown in the following table 199 in addition the epa accounted for the upstream co2 emissions associated with the production and distribution of electricity required to charge the phevs since electricity production in the united states varies significantly from region to region the epa considered three scenariosranges with the low end of the range corresponding to the california powerplant emissions factor the middle of the range represented by the national average powerplant emissions factor and the upper end of the range corresponding to the powerplant emissions factor for the rockies the epa estimates that the electricity ghg emission factors for various regions of the country vary from 346 g co2kw-hr in california to 986 g co2kw-hr in the rockies with a national average of 648 g co2kw-hr 199 the following table shows the tailpipe emissions and the combined tailpipe and upstream emissions for each of the 10 my 2014 phevs available in the us market national bureau of economic researchedit most emission analysis use average emissions rates across regions instead of marginal generation at different times of the day the former approach does not take into account the generation mix within interconnected electricity markets and shifting load profiles throughout the day 306 307 an analysis by three economist affiliated with the national bureau of economic research nber published in november 2014 developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the united states the study used emissions and consumption data for 2007 through 2009 and used the specifications for the chevrolet volt all-electric range of 35mi  56km the analysis found that marginal emission rates are more than three times as large in the upper midwest compared to the western us and within regions rates for some hours of the day are more than twice those for others 307 applying the results of the marginal analysis to plug-in electric vehicles the nber researchers found that the emissions of charging pevs vary by region and hours of the day in some regions such as the western us and texas co2 emissions per mile from driving pevs are less than those from driving a hybrid car however in other regions such as the upper midwest charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 am implies that pevs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road the results show a fundamental tension between electricity load management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions this occurs because coal-fired units which have higher emission rates are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand while natural gas units which have relatively low emissions rates are often brought online to meet peak demand this pattern of fuel shifting explains why emission rates tend to be higher at night and lower during periods of peak demand in the morning and evening 307 production and salesedit production modelsedit the byd f3dm became the worlds first mass-produced plug-in hybrid compact sedan as it went
