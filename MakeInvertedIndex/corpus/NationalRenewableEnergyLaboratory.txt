began operating in 1977 as the solar energy research institute under the jimmy carter administration it was the recipient of a large budget and its activities went beyond research and development in solar energy as it tried to popularize knowledge about already existing technologies like passive solar amongst the population during the ronald reagan administration the institutes budget was cut by some 90 many employees reduced in force and the laboratorys activities were reduced to rd in later years renewed interest in the energy problem improved the institutes position but funding has fluctuated in 2006 funding had dropped to the point that nrel was forced to lay off 32 workers 3 and in 2011 anticipated congressional budget shortfalls led to a voluntary buyout program for 100 to 150 staff reductions 4 since its inception in 1977 as the solar energy research institute it has been operated under contract by mriglobal 5 in september 1991 the nrel was designated a national laboratory of the us department of energy doe by president george hw bush and its name was changed to nrel currently nrel is managed for the doe by the alliance for sustainable energy llc the alliance was formed in 2008 as a joint venture between mriglobal and battelle 6 dr dan e arvizu became nrels eighth laboratory director in january 2005 and currently serves as both the director of the lab and president of the alliance 7 nrels areas of research and development expertise are renewable electricity renewable fuels integrated energy systems and strategic energy analysis 8 in 2011 nrel became the co-secretariat of the low emission development strategies global partnership leds gp alongside the climate  development knowledge network cdkn funding in 2009 and 2010edit the fy 2010 congressional appropriations for renewable energy items were 10 solar energy $79.7 million wind energy $38.8 million biomass and biorefinery systems rd $38.3 million hydrogen technology $16.4 million geothermal technology $4.8 million water power $4.2 million for 2009 funding was broken down between its major groups wind $33.9 million biofuels $35.4 million solar $72.4 million 11 commercialization and technology transferedit nrel works closely with a number of private partners to transfer technological developments in renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to the marketplace and social arena 12 nrels innovative technologies have been recognized with 57 rd 100 awards the engineering and science behind these technology transfer successes and awards demonstrates nrels commitment to a sustainable energy future 8 the idea of technology transfer was added to the mission of nrel as a means of enhancing commercial impact and societal benefit ultimately justifying the use of tax dollars to in part fund the projects in the lab 13 as many of these technologies are young and often just emerging nrel aims to reduce the risk of private sector investment and adoption of their developments 12 three key pieces of federal legislation laid the policy framework to enact technology transfer the stevenson-wydler technology innovation act of 1980 the bayh-dole act or the university and small business patent procedures act of 1980 and the federal technology transfer act of 1986 13 ultimately many of the deployed technologies help mitigate the oil dependence of the united states reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and maintain us industry competitiveness 12 deployment of technologies is accomplished by developing technology partnerships with private industry 12 nrel serves as a reduced-risk platform for research and through partnerships those advances can effectively be translated into serving the interest of both the private sector and the public sector 12 the energy goals set by the doe are at the forefront of the research done in the laboratory and the research reflects the energy goals which are designed with the interest of us industry competitiveness in mind 12 the challenge to achieving these goals is investment security 14 part of the technology transfer process is to form partnerships that not only focus on financial security but also to consider partners who have demonstrated core values that reflect the integrity to manage the introduction and assimilation of the technological developments 14 nrel focuses on the core values of the partnering entity the willingness to set and meet timely goals dedication to transparency and a reciprocating intent to further development 12 under these partnership agreements nrel does not fund projects conducted by their private partners 14 nrel does provide funding opportunities through their competitively placed contracts 14 in order to form a technology partnership agreement with nrel there are essentially 11 steps 14 the process is estimated to require 45 business days 14 subject to negotiations technology partnership agreements provide only the technical services of nrel 14 moving further than technology partnership agreements are licensing agreements and nondisclosure agreements licensing agreements provide industry to market and commercialize technology developed by nrel this type of agreement is available to any organization regardless of size 15 a nondisclosure agreement is an agreement to implement confidentiality of information for a mutually beneficial collaboration in research and development 15 prior successes include the nrel and skyfuel partnership in the next generation of solar parabolic troughs and also the partnership between nrel scientists ampulse corporation and oak ridge national laboratory ornl to create a less expensive alternative to wafer crystalline silicon solar cells 16 cooperative research and development agreementedit a cooperative research and development agreement crada is a partnership between nrel and an outside company this type of agreement protects the intellectual property of both nrel and the outside company and allows the investing company the right to exclusive field-of-use license for any inventions that come out of the crada there are two types of cradas a shared-resource crada is used to develop advance or commercialize an nrel project without money changing hands 17 the development and progress of a shared-resource crada must fit within the scope of an existing nrel project already funded by the doe the second type of agreement is called a funds-in crada it allows for the partner to pay for some or all of nrel expenses under a project but nrel does not supply funds to the partner 17 a specific example of a cooperative research and development agreement crada is between nrel oak ridge national laboratory ornl and the ampulse corporation to develop a less expensive silicon solar cell funding came from both parties and the resulting processes and investigations were carried out in cooperation between the three entities two federal and one non-federal 18 work for othersedit nrel offers technical services to partners who require resources that are not available to them through the form of a work-for-others agreement this agreement differs from cradas in that they are not for the purpose of performing joint research the partner covers the entire cost of the project 19 there are four types of work-for-others agreements technology licensingedit nrel offers licensing for many of its technologies related to energy efficiency and renewable energy development licensing of nrels intellectual property is available to businesses of any size from start-up to fortune 500 the available technologies fall under the categories of renewable electricity conversion and delivery systems renewable fuels formulation and delivery efficient and integrated energy systems and strategic energy analysis nrel-developed technologies include vehicles and fuels basic sciences biomass concentrating solar power electric infrastructure systems geothermal hydrogen and fuel cells photovoltaics and wind energy 20 nrel has a list of 33 market summaries available for licensing and the list includes information about the descriptions of the technologies their benefits potential applications and their current stage in development 20 in addition to market summaries nrel and the doe hold 457 patents under the heading of energy efficiency and renewable energy
