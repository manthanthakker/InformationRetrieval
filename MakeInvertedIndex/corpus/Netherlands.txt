northwest sharing maritime borders with belgium the united kingdom and germany 9 the largest cities in the netherlands are amsterdam the hague and rotterdam amsterdam is the countrys capital 10 while the hague holds the dutch seat of government and parliament 11 the port of rotterdam is the largest port in europe  as large as the next three largest combined  and was the worlds largest port between 1962 and 2004 12 the name holland is also frequently and incorrectly used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the netherlands netherlands literally means lower countries influenced by its low land and flat geography with only about 50 of its land exceeding one metre above sea level 13 most of the areas below sea level are man-made since the late 16th century large areas polders have been reclaimed from the sea and lakes amounting to nearly 17 of the countrys current land mass with a population density of 408 people per km2  505 july 2016 if water is excluded  the netherlands is a very densely populated country only bangladesh south korea and taiwan have both a larger population and a higher population density england at 420 people per km2 is also more densely populated nevertheless the netherlands is the worlds second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products after the united states 14 15 this is partly due to the fertility of the soil and the mild climate the netherlands was the third country in the world to have an elected parliament and since 1848 it has been governed as a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy organised as a unitary state the netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and is generally regarded as a liberal country having legalised abortion prostitution and euthanasia while maintaining a progressive drugs

international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia the international criminal court and the special tribunal for lebanon the first four are situated in the hague as is the eus criminal intelligence agency europol and judicial co-operation agency eurojust this has led to the city being dubbed the worlds legal capital 16 the netherlands is also a part of the schengen area the netherlands has a market-based mixed economy ranking 17th of 177 countries according to the index of economic freedom 17 it had the thirteenth-highest per capita income in the world in 2013 according

referred to by the much older designation holland meaning holt land or wood land though this refers only to north and south holland two of the nations twelve provinces formerly a single province and earlier the county of holland this originally frankish county emerged from the dissolved frisian kingdom and was after the decline of brabant economically and politically the most important county in the region because of this importance and the emphasis on holland during the anglo-dutch wars in the 17th and 18th century holland served as a pars pro toto for the entire country in english and is considered either incorrect 19 20 informal 21 or on occasion opprobrious depending on the context but is more acceptable when referring to the national football team 22 place names with neder or lage nieder nether or low and nedre are in use in various places in countries where a germanic language is spoken and has in french and latin its respective counterparts in bas or inferior they are sometimes used in relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as upper boven oben superior or haut in the case of the low countries the geographical location of the lower region has been more or less downstream and near the sea the geographical location of the upper region changed over time tremendously the romans made a distinction between the roman provinces of downstream germania inferior nowadays part of belgium and the netherlands and upstream germania superior nowadays part of germany the designation low to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century duchy of lower lorraine that covered much of the low countries 23 24 but this time the corresponding upper region is upper lorraine in nowadays northern france the dukes of burgundy who ruled the low countries in the 15th century used the term les pays de par deçà  the lands over here for the low countries as opposed to les pays de par delà  the lands over there for their original homeland burgundy in present-day east-central france 25 under habsburg rule les pays de par deçà developed in pays dembas lands down-here 26 a deictic expression in relation to other habsburg possessions in europe this was translated as neder-landen in contemporary dutch official documents 27 however niderlant was also the region between the meuse and the lower rhine in the late middle ages the area known as oberland high country was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located cologne from the mid-sixteenth century on the low countries or the netherlands was besides flanders probably the most commonly used name the eighty years war  1568–1648 divided the low countries into the northern united provinces belgica foederata in latin the federated netherlands and the southern netherlands belgica regia royal netherlands the low countries today is a designation that includes the countries the netherlands belgium and luxembourg it is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term benelux historyedit prehistory before 500 bcedit the prehistory of the area that is now the netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography the oldest human neanderthal traces in the netherlands were found in higher soils near maastricht from 250,000 years ago after the end of the ice age various paleolithic groups inhabited the area and around 8000 bc mesolithic tribes resided in friesland and drenthe where the oldest canoe in the world was recovered 28 autochthonous hunter-gatherers from the swifterbant culture are attested from around 5600 bc onwards 29 they are strongly linked to rivers and open water and were related to the southern scandinavian ertebølle culture  5300–4000 bc to the west the same tribes might have built hunting camps to hunt winter game people made the switch to animal husbandry sometime between 4800 bc and 4500 bc agricultural transformation took place very gradually between 4300 bc and 4000 bc 30 the farming funnelbeaker culture extended from denmark through northern germany into the northern netherlands and erected the dolmens large stone grave monuments found in drenthe built between 4100 bc and 3200 bc to the southwest the vlaardingen culture around 2600 bc an apparently more primitive culture of hunter-gatherers survived well into the neolithic period around 2950 bc there was a quick and smooth transition from the funnelbeaker farming culture to the pan-european corded ware pastoralist culture 31 the bell beaker culture also present in the netherlands apparently rose out of the corded ware culture 32 33 discoveries of copper artifacts imply trade with other parts of europe as the metal is not normally found in dutch soil the bronze age probably started somewhere around 2000 bc and lasted until around 800 bc the many finds in drenthe of rare and valuable objects suggest that it was a trading centre in the bronze age the bell beaker cultures  2700–2100 bc locally developed into the bronze age barbed-wire beaker culture  2100–1800 bc in the second millennium bc the region was the boundary between the atlantic and nordic horizons roughly divided by the course of the rhine in the north the elp culture c 1800 bc to 800 bc 34 was a bronze age archaeological culture having earthenware pottery of low quality as a marker the initial phase was characterised by tumuli  1800–1200 bc that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern germany and scandinavia and were apparently related to the tumulus culture  1600–1200 bc in central europe this phase was followed by a subsequent change featuring urnfield cremation burial customs  1200–800 bc the southern region became dominated by the hilversum culture  1800–800 bc which apparently inherited cultural ties with britain of the previous barbed-wire beaker culture the iron age brought a measure of prosperity iron ore was available throughout the country including bog iron extracted from the ore in peat bogs in the north the natural iron-bearing balls found in the veluwe and the red iron ore near the rivers in brabant smiths travelled from small settlement to settlement with bronze and iron fabricating tools on demand including axes knives pins arrowheads and swords some evidence even suggests the making of damascus steel swords using an advanced method of forging that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel the kings grave of oss dating from around 500 bc was found in a burial mound the largest of its kind in western europe and containing an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral germanic groups and romans  500 bc  410 adedit the deteriorating climate in scandinavia around 850 bc that further deteriorated around 650 bc might have triggered migration of germanic tribes from the north by the time this migration was complete around 250 bc a few general cultural and linguistic groups had emerged 35 36 the north sea germanic ingvaeones or istvaeones inhabited the northern part of the low countries they would later develop into the frisii and the early saxons 36 a second grouping the weser-rhine germanic extended along the middle rhine and weser and inhabited the low countries south of the great rivers this group consisted of tribes that would eventually develop into the salian franks 36 also the celtic la tène culture c 450 bc up to the roman conquest had expanded over a wide range including the southern area of the low countries some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language neither germanic nor celtic survived in the netherlands until the roman period the iron age nordwestblock culture 37 38 that eventually was being absorbed by the celts to the south and the germanic peoples from the east during the gallic wars the area south of the oude rijn and west of the rhine was conquered by roman forces under julius caesar from 57 bc to 53 bc 38 caesar describes two main tribes living in what is now the southern netherlands the menapii and the eburones the rhine became fixed as romes northern frontier around 12 ad notable towns would arise along the limes germanicus nijmegen and voorburg at first part of gallia belgica the area south of the limes became part of the roman province of germania inferior the area to the north of the rhine inhabited by the frisii remained outside roman rule but not its presence and control while the border tribes batavi and cananefates served in the roman cavalry 39 the batavi rose against the romans in the batavian rebellion of 69ad but were eventually defeated the batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the salian franks whose identity emerged at the first half of the third century 40 salian franks appear in roman texts as both allies and enemies the salian franks were forced by the confederation of the saxons from the east to move over the rhine into roman territory in the fourth century from their new base in west flanders and the southwest netherlands they were raiding the english channel roman forces pacified the region but did not expel the franks who continued to be feared at least until the time of julian the apostate  358 when salian franks were allowed to settle as foederati in toxandria 40 after deteriorating climate conditions and the romans withdrawal the frisii disappeared from the northern netherlands probably forced to resettle within roman territory as laeti in c 296 coastal lands remained largely unpopulated for the next two centuries 41 early middle ages  411–1000edit after roman government in the area collapsed the franks expanded their territories in numerous kingdoms by the 490s clovis i had conquered and united all these territories in the southern netherlands in one frankish kingdom and from there continued his conquests into gaul during this expansion franks migrating to the south eventually adopted the vulgar latin of the local population 36 a widening cultural divide grew with the franks remaining in their original homeland in the north ie southern netherlands and flanders who kept on speaking old frankish which by the ninth century had evolved into old low franconian or old dutch 36 a dutch-french language boundary came into existence 36 42 to the north of the franks climatic conditions on the coast improved and during the migration period the abandoned land was resettled again mostly by saxons but also by the closely related angles jutes and ancient frisii 43 many moved on to england and came to be known as anglo-saxons but those who stayed would be referred to as frisians and their language as frisian named after the land that was once inhabited by frisii 43 frisian was spoken along the entire southern north sea coast and it is still the language most closely related to english among the living languages of continental europe by the seventh century a frisian kingdom  650–734 under king aldegisel and king redbad emerged with utrecht as its centre of power 43 44 while dorestad was a flourishing trading place 45 46 between 600 and around 719 the cities were often fought over between the frisians and the franks in 734 at the battle of the boarn the frisians were defeated after a series of wars with the approval of the franks the anglo-saxon missionary willibrord converted the frisian people to christianity he established the archdiocese of utrecht and became bishop of the frisians however his successor boniface was murdered by the frisians in dokkum in 754 the frankish carolingian empire modeled itself after the roman empire and controlled much of western europe however as of 843 it was divided into three partseast middle and west francia most of present-day netherlands became part of middle francia which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours it comprises territories from frisia in the north to the kingdom of italy in the south when the middle kingdom was partitioned the lands north of the alps passed to lothair ii and consecutively were named lotharingia after he died in 869 lotharingia was partitioned into upper and lower lotharingia the latter part comprising the low countries that technically became part of east francia in 870 although it was effectively under the control of vikings who raided the largely defenceless frisian and frankish towns lying on the frisian coast and along the rivers around 850 lothair i acknowledged the viking rorik of dorestad as ruler of most of frisia 47 around 879 another viking raided the frisian lands godfrid duke of frisia the viking raids made the sway of french and german lords in the area weak resistance to the vikings if any came from local nobles who gained in stature as a result and that lay the basis for the disintegration of lower lotharingia into semi-independent states one of these local nobles was gerolf of holland who assumed lordship in frisia after he helped to assassinate godfrid and viking rule came to an end high middle ages  1000–1384edit the holy roman empire the successor state of east francia ruled much of the low countries in the 10th and 11th century but was not able to maintain political unity powerful local nobles turned their cities counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor holland hainaut flanders gelre brabant and the utrecht were in a state of almost continual war or paradoxically formed personal unions the language and culture of most of the people who lived in the county of holland were originally frisian as frankish settlement progressed from flanders and brabant the area quickly became old low franconian or old dutch the rest of frisia in the north now friesland and groningen continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions collectively called the frisian freedom and resented the imposition of the feudal system around 1000 ad due to several agricultural developments the economy started to develop at a fast pace and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen towns grew around monasteries and castles and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas especially in flanders and later also brabant wealthy cities started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign in practice this meant that brugge and antwerp became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in europe around 1100 ad farmers from flanders and utrecht began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western netherlands and made the emergence of the county of holland as center of power possible the title of count of holland were fought over in the hook and cod wars dutch hoekse en kabeljauwse twisten between 1350 and 1490 the cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities while the hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen these noblemen invited the duke philip the good of burgundy  who was also count of flanders  to conquer holland burgundian and habsburg netherlands  1384–1581edit most of the imperial and french fiefs in what is now the netherlands and belgium were united in a personal union by philip the good duke of burgundy in 1433 the house of valois-burgundy and their habsburg heirs would rule the low countries in the period from 1384 to 1581 before the burgundian union the dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county the burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began the new rulers defended dutch trading interests which then developed rapidly the fleets of the county of holland defeated the fleets of the hanseatic league several times amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in europe for grain from the baltic region amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of belgium northern france and england this trade was vital because holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself land drainage had caused the peat of the former wetlands to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained under habsburg charles v ruler of the holy roman empire and king of spain all fiefs in the current netherlands region were united into the seventeen provinces which also included most of present-day belgium luxembourg and some adjacent land in what is now france and germany in 1568 the eighty years war between the provinces and their spanish ruler began in 1579 the northern half of the seventeen provinces forged the union of utrecht in which they committed to support each other in their defence against the spanish army 48 the union of utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern netherlands in 1581 the northern provinces adopted the act of abjuration the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed philip ii of spain as reigning monarch in the northern provinces 49 the protestant queen elizabeth i of england sympathised with the dutch struggle against the spanish and sent an army of 7,600 soldiers to aid the dutch in their war with the catholic spanish 50 the english army under command of robert dudley 1st earl of leicester was of no real benefit to the dutch rebellion 51 philip ii the son of charles v was not prepared to let them go easily and war continued until 1648 when spain under king philip iv finally recognised the independence of the seven north-western provinces in the peace of münster parts of the southern provinces became de facto colonies of the new republican-mercantile empire dutch republic  1581–1795edit after declaring their independence the provinces of holland zeeland groningen friesland utrecht overijssel and gelderland formed a confederation all these duchies lordships and counties were autonomous and had their own government the states-provincial the states general the confederal government were seated in the hague and consisted of representatives from each of the seven provinces the sparsely populated region of drenthe was part of the republic too although it was not considered one of the provinces moreover the republic had come to occupy during the eighty years war a number of so-called generality lands in flanders brabant and limburg their population was mainly roman catholic and these areas did not have a governmental structure of their own and were used as a buffer zone between the republic and the spanish-controlled southern netherlandscitation needed in the dutch golden age spanning much of the 17th century the dutch empire grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers science military and art especially painting were among the most acclaimed in the world by 1650 the dutch owned 16,000 merchant ships 52 the dutch east india company and the dutch west india company established colonies and trading posts all over the world including ruling the northern parts of taiwan between 1624–1662 and 1664–1667 the dutch settlement in north america began with the founding of new amsterdam on the southern part of manhattan in 1614 in south africa the dutch settled the cape colony in 1652 dutch colonies in south america were established along the many rivers in the fertile guyana plains among them colony of surinam now suriname in asia the dutch established the dutch east indies now indonesia and the only western trading post in japan dejima many economic historians regard the netherlands as the first thoroughly capitalist country in the world in early modern europe it had the wealthiest trading city amsterdam and the first full-time stock exchange the inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the boom-bust cycle the worlds first asset-inflation bubble the tulip mania of 1636–1637 and the worlds first bear raider isaac le maire who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount 53 the republic went into a state of general decline in the later 18th century with economic competition from england and long-standing rivalries between the two main factions in dutch society the republican staatsgezinden and the supporters of the stadtholder the prinsgezinden as main political factionscitation needed batavian republic and kingdom  1795–1890edit with the armed support of revolutionary france dutch republicans proclaimed the batavian republic modelled after the french republic and rendering the netherlands a unitary state on 19 january 1795 the stadtholder william v of orange had fled to england but from 1806 to 1810 the kingdom of holland was set up by napoleon bonaparte as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother louis bonaparte to control the netherlands more effectively however king louis bonaparte tried to serve dutch interests instead of his brothers and he was forced to abdicate on 1 july 1810 the emperor sent in an army and the netherlands became part of the french empire until the autumn of 1813 when napoleon was defeated in the battle of leipzig william frederick son of the last stadtholder returned to the netherlands in 1813 and proclaimed himself sovereign prince of the netherlands two years later the congress of vienna added the southern netherlands to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of france william frederick raised this united netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself king william i in addition william became hereditary grand duke of luxembourg in exchange for his german possessions however the southern netherlands had been culturally separate from the north since 1581 and rebelled the south gained independence in 1830 as belgium while the personal union between luxembourg and the netherlands was severed in 1890 when william iii died with no surviving male heirs ascendancy laws prevented his daughter queen wilhelmina from becoming the next grand duchess the belgian revolution at home and the java war in the dutch east indies brought the netherlands to the brink of bankruptcy however the cultivation system was introduced in 1830 in the dutch east indies 20 of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export the policy brought the dutch enormous wealth and made the colony self-sufficient on the other hand the colonies in the west indies dutch guiana and curaçao and dependencies relied heavily on african slaves in which the dutch part is estimated at 5–7 percent or more than half a million africans the netherlands abolished slavery in 1863 54 furthermore slaves in suriname would be fully free only in 1873 since the law stipulated that there was to be a mandatory 10-year transition 55 the dutch were also one of the last european countries to industrialise in the second half of the 19th century world wars and beyond  1890presentedit the netherlands were able to remain neutral during world war i in part because the import of goods through the netherlands proved essential to german survival until the blockade by the british royal navy in 1916 56 that changed in world war ii when nazi germany invaded the netherlands on 10 may 1940 the rotterdam blitz forced the main element of the dutch army to surrender four days later during the occupation over 100,000 dutch jews 57 were rounded up and transported to nazi extermination camps of whom only a few survived dutch workers were conscripted for forced labour in germany civilians who resisted were killed in reprisal for attacks on german soldiers and the countryside was plundered for food although there were thousands of dutch who risked their lives by hiding jews from the germans over 20,000 dutch fascists joined the waffen ss 58 fighting on the eastern front 59 political collaborators were members of the fascist nsb the only legal political party in the occupied netherlands on 8 december 1941 the dutch government-in-exile in london declared war on japan 60 but could not prevent the japanese occupation of the dutch east indies indonesia 61 in 1944–45 the first canadian army which included canadian british and polish troops was responsible for liberating much of the netherlands 62 but soon after ve day the dutch fought a colonial war against the new republic of indonesia in 1954 the charter for the kingdom of the netherlands reformed the political structure of the netherlands which was a result of international pressure to carry out decolonisation the dutch colonies of surinam and curaçao and dependencies and the european country all became countries within the kingdom on a basis of equality indonesia had declared its independence in august 1945 recognised in 1949 and thus was never part of the reformed kingdom suriname followed in 1975 after the war the netherlands left behind also an era of neutrality and gained closer ties with neighboring states the netherlands was one of the founding members of the benelux the nato euratom and the european coal and steel community which would evolve into the eec common market and later the european union government-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce population density prompted some 500,000 dutch people to leave the country after the war 63 the 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change such as rapid ontzuiling literally depillarisation a term that describes the decay of the old divisions along political and religious lines youths and students in particular rejected traditional mores and pushed for change in matters such as womens rights sexuality disarmament and environmental issues on 10 october 2010 the netherlands antilles was dissolved referendums were held on each island to determine their future status as a result the islands of bonaire sint eustatius and saba the bes islands were to obtain closer ties with the netherlands this led to the incorporation of these three islands into the country of the netherlands as special municipalities upon the dissolution of the netherlands antilles the special municipalities are collectively known as the caribbean netherlands geographyedit the european area of the netherlands lies between latitudes 50 and 54 n and longitudes 3 and 8 e the netherlands is geographically a very low and flat country with about 26 of its area 64 and 21 of its population 65 located below sea level and only about 50 of its land exceeding one metre above sea level 13 the country is for the most part flat with the exception of foothills in the far southeast up to a height of no more than 321 metres and some low hill ranges in the central parts most of the areas below sea level are man-made caused by peat extraction or achieved through land reclamation since the late 16th century large polder areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include dikes canals and pumping stations nearly 17 of the countrys land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes much of the country was originally formed by the estuaries of three large european rivers the rhine rijn the meuse maas and the scheldt schelde as well as their tributaries the south-western part of the netherlands is to this day a river delta of these three rivers the rhine-meuse-scheldt delta the netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the rhine the waal its main tributary branch and the meuse in the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between fiefdoms and hence historically created a cultural divide as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the dutch call their great rivers de grote rivieren another significant branch of the rhine the ijssel river discharges into lake ijssel the former zuiderzee southern sea just like the previous this river forms a linguistic divide people to the northeast of this river speak dutch low saxon dialects except for the province of friesland which has its own language 66 floodsedit over the centuries the dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention most notable in terms of land loss was the storm of 1134 which created the archipelago of zeeland in the south-west on 14 december 1287 st lucias flood affected the netherlands and germany killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history 67 the st elizabeth flood of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed polder replacing it with the 72-square-kilometre  28sqmi biesbosch tidal floodplains in the south-centre the huge north sea flood of early february 1953 caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the netherlands more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood the dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme the delta works to protect the country against future flooding which was completed over a period of more than thirty years the impact of disasters was to an extent increased through human activity relatively high-lying swampland was drained to be used as farmland the drainage caused the fertile peat to contract and ground levels to drop upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level causing the underlying peat to contract further additionally until the 19th century peat was mined dried and used for fuel further exacerbating the problem centuries of extensive and poorly controlled peat extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres even in flooded areas peat extraction continued through turf dredging because of the flooding farming was difficult which encouraged foreign trade the result of which was that the dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century 68 to guard against floods a series of defences against the water were contrived in the first millennium ad villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called terps later these terps were connected by dikes in the 12th century local government agencies called waterschappen water boards or hoogheemraadschappen high home councils started to appear whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods these agencies continue to exist as the ground level dropped the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system by the 13th century windmills had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level the windmills were later used to drain lakes creating the famous polderscitation needed in 1932 the afsluitdijk closure dike was completed blocking the former zuiderzee southern sea from the north sea and thus creating the ijsselmeer ijssel lake it became part of the larger zuiderzee works in which four polders totalling 2,500 square kilometres  965sqmi were reclaimed from the sea 69 70 the netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from climate change not only is the rising sea a problem but erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow 71 72 73 delta worksedit after the 1953 disaster the delta works were constructed a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the dutch coast the project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the maeslantkering new projects have been periodically started since to renovate and renew the delta works a main goal of the delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in south holland and zeeland to once per 10,000 years compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country this was achieved by raising 3,000 kilometres  1,864mi of outer sea-dykes and 10,000 kilometres  6,214mi of inner canal and river dikes and by closing off the sea estuaries of the zeeland province new risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional delta project dyke reinforcements the delta project is considered by the american society of civil engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world 74 it is anticipated that global warming in the 21st century will result in a rise in sea level which despite popular belief will possibly not overwhelm the measures the netherlands has taken to control floodscitation needed even more specifically the netherlands is the only country in the world actively preparing for a sea level rise a politically neutral delta commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea level rise of 1.10 metres  3.6ft and a simultaneous land height decline of 10 centimetres  3.9in the plan encompasses the reinforcement of the existing coastal defenses like dikes and dunes with 1.30 metres  4.3ft of additional flood protection climate change will not only threaten the netherlands from the sea side but could also alter rain fall patterns and river run-off to protect the country from river flooding another program is already being executed the room for the river plan grants more flow space to rivers protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands the few residents who lived in these so-called overflow areas have been moved to higher ground with some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels 75 protecting the country against floods is one element of climate change the other is that the pressure of the sea water on ground water will increasecitation needed as a result the fresh water table will be pushed more inland resulting in more brackish or saline groundwater in the coastal provinces due to this change some drinking water areas will be forced to apply desalination despite the apparent abundance of water it will also affect agriculture the greenhouses can continue their production by becoming more water efficient they are already disconnected from the groundwater thereby not becoming more saline though they will need to become more energy and water efficient the push of more brackish water into the mainland will also cause changes in flora and faunacitation needed climateedit the predominant wind direction in the netherlands is southwest which causes a moderate maritime climate with warm summers and cool winters and typically high humidity this is especially true close to the dutch coastline where the difference in temperature between summer and winter as well as between day and night is noticeably smaller than it is in the southeast of the country the following tables are based on mean measurements by the knmi weather station in de bilt between 1981 and 2010 ice days maximum temperature below 0c  32f usually occur from december until february with the occasional rare ice day prior to or after that period freezing days minimum temperature below 0c  32f occur much more often usually ranging from mid-november to late march but not rarely measured as early as mid-october and as late as mid-may if one chooses the height of measurement to be 10cm  4in above ground instead of 150cm  59in one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer on average snow can occur from november to april but sometimes occurs in may or october too warm days maximum temperature above 20c  68f in de bilt are usually found in april to october but in some parts of the country these warm days can also occur in march or even sometimes in november or february usually not in de bilt however summer days maximum temperature above 25c  77f are usually measured in de bilt from may until september tropical days maximum temperature above 30c  86f are rare and usually occur only in june to august precipitation throughout the year is distributed relatively equally each month summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days this is especially the case in summer when lightning is also much more frequent the number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in december and nearly 17 hours in june natureedit the netherlands has 20 national parks and hundreds of other nature reserves that include lakes heathland woods dunes and other habitats most of these are owned by staatsbosbeheer the national department for forestry and nature conservation and natuurmonumenten literally natures monuments a private organisation that buys protects and manages nature reserves the dutch part of the wadden sea in the north with its tidal flats and wetlands is rich in biological diversity and was declared a unesco world heritage nature site in 2009 the oosterschelde formerly the northeast estuary of the river scheldt was designated a national park in 2002 thereby making it the largest national park in the netherlands at an area of 370 square kilometres  140sqmi it consists primarily of the salt waters of the oosterschelde but also includes mud flats meadows and shoals because of the large variety of sea life including unique regional species the park is popular with scuba divers other activities include sailing fishing cycling and bird watching phytogeographically the netherlands is shared between the atlantic european and central european provinces of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom according to the world wide fund for nature the territory of the netherlands belongs to the ecoregion of atlantic mixed forests in 1871 the last old original natural woods were cut down and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like scots pine and trees that are not native to the netherlandscitation needed these woods were planted on anthropogenic heaths and sand-drifts overgrazed heaths veluwe caribbean islandsedit the caribbean netherlands are designated as special municipalities of the netherlands the islands form a part of the lesser antilles within this island group bonaire is part of the abc islands within the leeward antilles island chain off the venezuelan coast the leeward antilles have a mixed volcanic and coral origin saba and sint eustatius are part of the sss islands they are located east of puerto rico and the virgin islands although in the english language they are considered part of the leeward islands french spanish dutch and the english spoken locally consider them part of the windward islands the windward islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly leaving little ground suitable for agriculture the highest point is mount scenery 887 metres  2,910ft on saba this is the highest point in the country and is also the highest point of the entire kingdom of the netherlands the islands of the caribbean netherlands enjoy a tropical climate with warm weather all year round the leeward antilles are warmer and drier than the windward islands in summer the windward islands can be subject to hurricanes politicsedit the netherlands has been a constitutional monarchy since 1815 and a parliamentary democracy since 1848 the netherlands is described as a consociational state dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues within both the political community and society as a whole in 2010 the economist ranked the netherlands as the 10th most democratic country in the world the monarch is the head of state at present king willem-alexander constitutionally the position is equipped with limited powers by law the king the title queen has no constitutional significance has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs depending on the personalities and relationships of the king and the ministers the king might have influence beyond the power granted by the constitution the executive power is formed by the council of ministers the deliberative council of the dutch cabinet the cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of state secretaries one to three ministers are ministers without portfolio the head of government is the prime minister of the netherlands who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition the prime minister is a primus inter pares with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers mark rutte has been prime minister since october 2010 the prime minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973 the cabinet is responsible to the bicameral parliament the states general which also has legislative powers the 150 members of the house of representatives the lower house are elected in direct elections on the basis of party-list proportional representation these are held every four years or sooner in case the cabinet falls for example when one of the chambers carries a motion of no confidence the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch the states-provincial are directly elected every four years as well the members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the senate the upper house which has the power to reject laws but not propose or amend them political cultureedit both trade unions and employers organisations are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial economic and social areas they meet regularly with government in the social-economic council this body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily the netherlands has a long tradition of social tolerance in the 18th century while the dutch reformed church was the state religion catholicism other forms of protestantism such as baptists and lutherans and judaism were tolerated but discriminated against in the late 19th century this dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of pillarisation in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government this tradition of tolerance influences dutch criminal justice policies on recreational drugs prostitution lgbt rights euthanasia and abortion which are among the most liberal in the world political partiesedit because of the multi-party system no single party has held a majority in parliament since the 19th century and coalition cabinets had to be formed since suffrage became universal in 1919 the dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties the strongest of which were the christian democrats currently represented by the christian democratic appeal cda second were the social democrats represented by the labour party pvda and third were the liberals of which the right wing peoples party for freedom and democracy vvd is the main representative these parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the christian democrats had always been a partner so either a centre-left coalition of the christian democrats and social democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of christian democrats and liberals in the 1970s the party system became more volatile the christian democratic parties lost seats while new parties became successful such as the radical democrat and progressive liberal d66 in the 1994 election the cda lost its dominant position a purple cabinet was formed by vvd d66 and pvda in the 2002 elections this cabinet lost its majority because of an increased support for the cda and the rise of the right lpf a new political party around pim fortuyn who was assassinated a week before the elections a short-lived cabinet was formed by cda vvd and lpf which was led by the cda leader jan peter balkenende after the 2003 elections in which the lpf lost most of its seats a cabinet was formed by cda vvd and d66 the cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the welfare state the healthcare system and immigration policy in june 2006 the cabinet fell after d66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the minister of immigration and integration rita verdonk who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of ayaan hirsi ali a vvd mp a caretaker cabinet was formed by cda and vvd and general elections were held on 22 november 2006 in these elections the cda remained the largest party and the socialist party made the largest gains the formation of a new cabinet took three months resulting in a coalition of cda pvda and christianunion on 20 february 2010 the cabinet fell when the pvda refused to prolong the involvement of the dutch army in uruzgan afghanistan 77 snap elections were held on 9 june 2010 with devastating results for the previously largest party the cda which lost about half of its seats resulting in 21 seats the vvd became the largest party with 31 seats closely followed by the pvda with 30 seats the big winner of the 2010 elections was geert wilders whose right wing pvv 78 79 the ideological successor to the lpf more than doubled its number of seats 80 negotiation talks for a new government resulted in a minority government led by vvd a first in coalition with cda which was sworn in on 14 october 2010 this unprecedented minority government was supported by pvv but proved ultimately to be unstable 81 when on 21 april 2012 wilders leader of pvv unexpectedly torpedoed seven weeks of austerity talks on new austerity measures paving the way for early elections 82 83 84 vvd and pvda were the big winners of the elections since 5 november 2012 they have formed the second rutte cabinet administrative divisionsedit the netherlands is divided into twelve provinces each under a commissioner of the king commissaris van de koning except for limburg province where the position is named governor gouverneur all provinces are divided into municipalities gemeenten of which there are 390  2016 85 the country is also subdivided into 24 water districts governed by a water board waterschap or hoogheemraadschap each having authority in matters concerning water management 86 the creation of water boards actually pre-dates that of the nation itself the first appearing in 1196 the dutch water boards are among the oldest democratic entities in the world still in existence direct elections of the water boards take place every 4 years the administrative structure on the 3 bes islands collectively known as the caribbean netherlands is different these islands have the status of openbare lichamen public bodies rather than municipalities and as administrative units are generally referred to as special municipalities they are not part of a province 87 foreign relationsedit the history of dutch foreign policy has been characterised by its neutrality since world war ii the netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations most prominently the un nato and the eu the dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on international trade the foreign policy of the netherlands is based on four basic commitments to atlantic co-operation to european integration to international development and to international law one of the more controversial international issues surrounding the netherlands is its liberal policy towards soft drugs during and after the dutch golden age the dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire the most important colonies were present-day suriname and indonesia indonesia became independent after the indonesian national revolution in the 1940s following a war of independence international pressure and several un security council resolutions surinam became independent in 1975 the historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the netherlands in addition many people from these countries are living permanently in the netherlands militaryedit the netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in europe it was first established as such by maurice of nassau the dutch army was used throughout the dutch empire after the defeat of napoleon the dutch army was transformed into a conscription army the army was unsuccessfully deployed during the belgian revolution in 1830 after 1830 it was deployed mainly in the dutch colonies as the netherlands remained neutral in european wars including the first world war until the netherlands was invaded in world war ii and quickly defeated by the wehrmacht in may 1940 the netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the treaty of brussels and became a founding member of nato in 1949 the dutch military was therefore part of the nato strength in cold war europe deploying its army to several bases in germany more than 3,000 dutch soldiers were assigned to the 2nd infantry division of the united states army during the korean war in 1996 conscription was suspended and the dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army since the 1990s the dutch army has been involved in the bosnian war and the kosovo war it held a province in iraq after the defeat of saddam hussein and it was engaged in afghanistan the military is composed of four branches all of which carry the prefix koninklijke royal koninklijke landmacht kl the royal netherlands

submarine service and the royal netherlands marine corps korps mariniers are open to women the korps commandotroepen the special operations force of the netherlands army is open to women but because of the extremely high physical demands for initial training it is almost impossible for women to become a commando 92 the dutch ministry of defence employs more than 70,000 personnel including over 20,000 civilians and over 50,000 military personnel 93 in april 2011 the government announced a major reduction in its military because of a cut in government expenditure including a decrease in the

economic importance is brabantstad a partnership between the municipalities of breda eindhoven helmond s-hertogenbosch and tilburg and the province of north brabant brabantstad is the fastest growing economic region in the netherlands with brainport as one of the three national top regions and as a top region in the world the region lies within the eindhoven-leuven-aachen triangle elat 103 the

in the netherlands is brabantstad one of the major economical important metropolitan regions of the netherlands of all the money that goes to research and development in the netherlands one third is spent in eindhoven a quarter of the jobs in the region are in technology and ict 104 of all european patent applications in the field of physics and electronics about eight per cent is from north brabant 105 in the extended region brabantstad is part of the eindhoven-leuven-aachen triangle elat this economic cooperation agreement between three cities in three countries has created one of the most innovative regions in the european union measured in terms of money invested in technology and knowledge economy 106 the economic success of this region is important for the international competitiveness of the netherlands together amsterdam airport rotterdam seaport and eindhoven brainport form the foundation of the dutch economy 107 the netherlands continues to be one of the leading european nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the five largest investors in the united states the economy experienced a slowdown in 2005 but in 2006 recovered to the fastest

of the dutch labour force but produces large surpluses for the food-processing industry and accounts for 21 percent of the dutch total export value 111 the dutch rank second worldwide in value of agricultural exports behind only the united states 112 with exports earning €80.7billion in 2014 113 up from €75.4billion in 2012 15 the netherlands has at some time in recent history supplied one quarter of all of the worlds exported tomatoes and trade of one-third of the worlds exports of chilis tomatoes and cucumbers goes through the country the netherlands also exports one-fifteenth of the

one of the densest road networks in the worldmuch denser than germany and france but still not as dense as belgium 118 about 13 of all distance is travelled by public transport the majority of which by train 116 like in many other european countries the dutch rail network of 3,013 routekm is also rather dense 119 the network is mostly focused on passenger rail services and connects virtually all major towns and cities trains are frequent with one or two trains per hour on lesser lines two to four trains per hour on average and up to eight trains an hour on the busiest lines cycling is a ubiquitous mode of transport in the netherlands almost as many kilometres are covered by bicycle as by train 116 the dutch are estimated to have at least 18 million bicycles 120 121 which makes more than one per capita and twice as many as the c 9 million motor vehicles on the road 122 in 2013 the european cyclists federation ranked both the netherlands and denmark as the most bike-friendly countries in europe 123 but more of the dutch  31 than of the danes  19 list the bike as their main mode of transport for daily activities 124 125 cycling infrastructure is comprehensive busy roads have received some 35,000km of dedicated cycle tracks physically segregated from motorised traffic 126 busy junctions are often equipped with bicycle-specific traffic lights there are large bicycle parking facilities particularly in city centres and at train stations rotterdam has the largest port in europe with the rivers meuse and rhine providing excellent access to the hinterland upstream reaching to basel switzerland and into france as of 2013update rotterdam was the worlds eighth largest container port handling 440.5 million metric tonnes of cargo annually 127 the ports main activities are petrochemical industries and general cargo handling and transshipment the harbour functions as an important transit point for bulk materials and between the european continent and overseas from rotterdam goods are transported by ship river barge train or road in 2007 the betuweroute a new fast freight railway from rotterdam to germany was completed schiphol airport just southwest of amsterdam is the main international airport in the netherlands and the fifth busiest airport in europe in terms of passengers total passengers in 2016 will be over 60 million as part of its commitment to environmental sustainability the dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 recharging stations for electric vehicles across the country by 2015 the rollout will be undertaken by switzerland-based power and automation company abb and dutch startup fastned and will aim to provide at least one station within a 50-kilometre radius  30 miles from every home in the
