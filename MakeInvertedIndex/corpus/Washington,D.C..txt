various tribes of the algonquian-speaking piscataway people also known as the conoy inhabited the lands around the potomac river when europeans first visited the area in the early 17th century one group known as the nacotchtank also called the nacostines by catholic missionaries maintained settlements around the anacostia river within the present-day district of columbia conflicts with european colonists and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the piscataway people some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near point of rocks maryland 3 in his federalist no 43 published january 23 1788 james madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety 4 five years earlier a band of unpaid soldiers besieged congress while its members were meeting in philadelphia known as the pennsylvania mutiny of 1783 the event emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security 5 article one section eight of the constitution permits the establishment of a district not exceeding tenmilessquare as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united states 6 however the constitution does not specify a location for the capital in what is now known as the compromise of 1790 madison alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson came to an agreement that the federal government would pay each states remaining revolutionary war debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the southern united states 7a foundation on july 9 1790 congress passed the residence act which approved the creation of a national capital on the potomac river the exact location was to be selected by president george washington who signed the bill into law on july 16 formed from land donated by the states of maryland and virginia the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles  16km on each side totaling 100 square miles  259km2 8b two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory the port of georgetown maryland founded in 1751 9 and the city of alexandria virginia founded in 1749 10 during 1791–92 andrew ellicott and several assistants including a free african american astronomer named benjamin banneker surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point 11 many of the stones are still standing 12 a new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the potomac to the east of georgetown on september 9 1791 the three commissioners overseeing the capitals construction named the city in honor of president washington the federal district was named columbia which was a poetic name for the united states commonly in use at that time 13 14 congress held its first session in washington on november 17 1800 15 congress passed the organic act of 1801 which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government further the unincorporated area within the district was organized into two counties the county of washington to the east of the potomac and the county of alexandria to the west 16 after the passage of this act citizens living in the district were no longer considered residents of maryland or virginia which therefore ended their representation in congress 17 on august 24–25 1814 in a raid known as the burning of washington british forces invaded the capital during the war of 1812 the capitol treasury and white house were burned and gutted during the attack 18 most government buildings were repaired quickly however the capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868 19 retrocession and the civil war in the 1830s the districts southern territory of alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by congress 20 the city of alexandria was a major market in the american slave trade and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in congress would end slavery in the district further depressing the economy alexandrias citizens petitioned virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district through a process known as retrocession 21 the virginia general assembly voted in february 1846 to accept the return of alexandria and on july 9 1846 congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by virginia therefore the districts current area consists only of the portion originally donated by maryland 20 confirming the fears of pro-slavery alexandrians the compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district although not slavery itself 22 the outbreak of the american civil war in 1861 led to expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the districts population including a large influx of freed slaves 23 president abraham lincoln signed the compensated emancipation act in 1862 which ended slavery in the district of columbia and freed about 3,100 enslaved persons nine months prior to the emancipation proclamation 24 in 1868 congress granted the districts african american male residents the right to vote in municipal elections 23 growth and redevelopment by 1870 the districts population had grown 75 from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents 25 despite the citys growth washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation some members of congress suggested moving the capital further west but president ulysses s grant refused to consider such a proposal 26 congress passed the organic act of 1871 which repealed the individual charters of the cities of washington and georgetown and created a new territorial government for the whole district of columbia 27 president grant appointed alexander robey shepherd to the position of governor in 1873 shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized washington but ultimately bankrupted the district government in 1874 congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member board of commissioners 28 the citys first motorized streetcars began service in 1888 and generated growth in areas of the district beyond the city of washingtons original boundaries washingtons urban plan was expanded throughout the district in the following decades 29 georgetown was formally annexed by the city of washington in 1895 30 however the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works washington was the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the city beautiful movement in the early 1900s 31 increased federal spending as a result of the new deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings memorials and museums in washington 32 world war ii further increased government activity adding to the number of federal employees in the capital 33 by 1950 the districts population reached its peak of 802,178 residents 25 civil rights and home rule era the twenty-third amendment to the united states constitution was ratified in 1961 granting the district three votes in the electoral college for the election of president and vice president but still no voting representation in congress 34 after the assassination of civil rights leader dr martin luther king jr on april 4 1968 riots broke out in the district primarily in the ustreet 14thstreet 7thstreet and hstreet corridors centers of black residential and commercial areas the riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops stopped the violence many stores and other buildings were burned rebuilding was not completed until the late 1990s 35 in 1973 congress enacted the district of columbia home rule act providing for an elected mayor and 13-member council for the district 36 in 1975 walter washington became the first elected and first black mayor of the district 37 on september 11 2001 terrorists hijacked american airlines flight 77 and deliberately crashed the plane into the pentagon in nearby arlington virginia united airlines flight 93 believed to be destined for washington dc crashed in

districts border with virginia and has two major tributaries the anacostia river and rock creek 41 tiber creek a natural watercourse that once passed through the national mall was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s 42 the creek also formed a portion of the now-filled washington city canal which allowed passage through the city to the anacostia river from 1815 until the 1850s 43 the

are often weak by the time they reach washington partly due to the citys inland location 65 flooding of the potomac river however caused by a combination of high tide storm surge and runoff has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of georgetown 66 precipitation occurs throughout the year 67 the highest recorded temperature was 106f  41c on august 6 1918 and on july 20

nights at or below freezing 59  v t e cityscape washington dc is a planned city in 1791 president washington commissioned pierre peter charles lenfant a french-born architect and city planner to design the new capital the lenfant plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles providing room for open space and landscaping 72 he based his design on plans of cities such as paris amsterdam karlsruhe and milan that thomas jefferson had sent to him 73 lenfants design also envisioned a garden-lined grand avenue approximately 1 mile  1.6km in length and 400 feet  120m wide in the area that is now the national mall 74 president washington dismissed lenfant in march 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capitals construction andrew ellicott who had worked with lenfant surveying the city was then tasked with completing the design though ellicott made revisions to the original plans including changes to some street patterns lenfant is still credited with the overall design of the city 75 by the early 1900s lenfants vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings including a railroad station on the national mall congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying washingtons ceremonial core 31 what became known as the mcmillan plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the capitol grounds and the national mall clearing slums and establishing a new citywide park system the plan is thought to have largely preserved lenfants intended design 72 by law washingtons skyline is low and sprawling the federal heights of buildings act of 1910 allows buildings that are no taller than the width of the adjacent street plus 20 feet  6.1m 76 despite popular belief no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the united states capitol or the 555-foot  169m washington monument 49 which remains the districts tallest structure city leaders have criticized the height restriction as a primary reason why the district has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused by urban sprawl 76 the district is divided into four quadrants of unequal area northwest nw northeast ne southeast se and southwest sw the axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the us capitol building 77 all road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the capitol most streets are set out in a grid pattern with eastwest streets named with letters eg c street sw northsouth streets with numbers eg 4th street nw and diagonal avenues many of which are named after states 77 the city of washington was bordered by boundary street to the north renamed florida avenue in 1890 rock creek to the west and the anacostia river to the east 29 72 washingtons street grid was extended where possible throughout the district starting in 1888 78 georgetowns streets were renamed in 1895 30 some streets are particularly noteworthy such as pennsylvania avenue which connects the white house to the capitol and k street which houses the offices of many lobbying groups 79 washington hosts 297 foreign embassies and related buildings many of which are on a section of massachusetts avenue informally known as embassy row 80 architecture the architecture

the citys foundation 94 african american residents composed about 30 of the districts total population between 1800 and 1940 25 the black population reached a peak of 70 by 1970 but has since steadily declined due to many african americans moving to the surrounding suburbs partly as a result of gentrification there was a 31.4 increase in the non-hispanic white population and an 11.5 decrease in the

this is still a murder rate of almost half that of the early 2000s 114 many neighborhoods such as columbia heights and logan circle are becoming safer and vibrant however incidents of robberies and
