turboexpander a turboexpander also referred to as a turbo-expander or an expansion turbine is a centrifugal or axial flow turbine through which a high pressure gas is expanded to produce work that is often used to drive a compressor 1 2 3 because work is extracted from the expanding high pressure gas the expansion is approximated by an isentropic process ie a constant entropy process and the low pressure exhaust gas from the turbine is at a very low temperature −150c or less depending upon the operating pressure and gas properties partial liquefaction of the expanded gas is not uncommon turboexpanders are very widely used as sources of refrigeration in industrial processes such as the extraction of ethane and natural gas liquids ngls from natural gas 4 the liquefaction of gases such as oxygen nitrogen helium argon and krypton 5 6 and other low-temperature processes turboexpanders currently in operation range in size from about 750 w to about 7.5 mw  1 hp to about 10,000hp

turboexpanders are very commonly used in low-temperature processes they are used in many other applications as well this section discusses one of the low temperature processes as well as some of the other applications extracting hydrocarbon liquids from natural gasedit raw natural gas consists primarily of methane ch4 the shortest and lightest hydrocarbon molecule as well as various amounts of heavier hydrocarbon gases such as ethane c2h6 propane c3h8 normal butane n-c4h10 isobutane i-c4h10 pentanes and even higher molecular weight hydrocarbons the raw gas also contains various amounts of acid gases such as carbon dioxide co2 hydrogen sulfide h2s and mercaptans such as methanethiol ch3sh and ethanethiol c2h5sh when processed into finished by-products see natural gas processing these heavier hydrocarbons are collectively referred to as ngl natural gas liquids the extraction of the ngl often involves a turboexpander 7 and a low-temperature distillation column called a demethanizer as shown in figure 2 the inlet gas to the demethanizer is first cooled to about −51c in a heat exchanger referred to as a cold box which partially condenses the inlet gas the resultant gas-liquid mixture is then separated into a gas stream and a liquid stream the liquid stream from the gas-liquid separator flows through a valve and undergoes a throttling expansion from an absolute pressure of 62 bar to 21 bar  6.2 to 2.1 mpa which is an isenthalpic process ie a constant enthalpy process that results in lowering the temperature of the stream from about −51c to about −81c as the stream enters the demethanizer the gas stream from the gas-liquid separator enters the turboexpander where it undergoes an isentropic expansion from an absolute pressure of 62 bar to 21 bar  6.2 to 2.1 mpa that lowers the gas stream temperature from about −51c to about −91c as it enters the demethanizer to serve as distillation reflux liquid from the top tray of the demethanizer at about −90c is routed through the cold box where it is warmed to about 0c as it cools the inlet gas and is then returned to the lower section of the demethanizer another liquid stream from the lower section of the demethanizer at about 2c is routed through the cold box and returned to the demethanizer at about 12c in effect the inlet gas provides the heat required to reboil the bottom of the demethanizer and the turboexpander removes the heat required to provide reflux in the top of the demethanizer the overhead gas product from the demethanizer at about −90c is processed natural gas that is of suitable quality for distribution to end-use consumers by pipeline it is routed through the cold box where it is warmed as it cools the inlet gas it is then compressed in the gas compressor which is driven by the turbo expander and further compressed in a second-stage gas compressor driven by an electric motor before entering the distribution pipeline the bottom product from the demethanizer is also warmed in the cold box as it cools the inlet gas before it leaves the system as ngl power generationedit figure 3 depicts an electric power generation system that uses a heat source a cooling medium air water or other a circulating working fluid and a turboexpander the system can accommodate a wide variety of heat sources such as geothermal hot water exhaust gas from internal combustion engines burning a variety of fuels natural gas landfill gas diesel oil or fuel oil a variety of waste heat sources in the form of either gas or liquid referring to figure 3 the circulating working fluid usually an organic compound such as r-134a is pumped to a high pressure and then vaporized in the evaporator by heat exchange with the available heat source the resulting high-pressure vapor flows to the turboexpander where it undergoes an isentropic expansion and exits as a vapor-liquid mixture which is then condensed into a liquid by heat exchange with the available cooling medium the condensed liquid is pumped back to the evaporator to complete the cycle the system in figure 3 is a rankine cycle as is used in fossil-fuel power plants where water is the working fluid and the heat source is derived from the combustion of natural gas fuel oil or coal used to generate high-pressure steam the high-pressure steam then undergoes an isentropic expansion in a conventional steam turbine the steam turbine exhaust steam is next condensed into liquid water which is then pumped back to steam generator to complete the cycle when an organic working fluid such as r-134a is used in the rankine cycle the cycle is sometimes referred to as an organic rankine cycle orc 8 9 10 refrigeration systemedit figure 4 depicts a refrigeration system with a capacity of about 100 to 1000 tons of refrigeration ie 350 to 3,500kw the system utilizes a compressor a turboexpander and an electric motor depending on the operating conditions the turboexpander reduces the load on the electric motor by some 6 to 15 as compared to a conventional vapor-compression refrigeration system that uses a throttling expansion valve rather than a turboexpander 11 basically this can be seen as a form of turbo compounding the system employs a high-pressure refrigerant ie one with a low normal boiling point such as 11 chlorodifluoromethane chclf2 known as r-22 with a normal boiling point of −47c 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane c2h2f4 known as r-134a with a normal boiling point of −26c as shown in figure 4 refrigerant vapor is compressed to a higher pressure resulting in a higher temperature as well the hot compressed vapor is then condensed into a liquid the condenser is where heat is expelled from the circulating refrigerant and is carried away by whatever cooling medium is used in the condenser air water etc the refrigerant liquid flows through the turboexpander where it is vaporized and the vapor undergoes an isentropic expansion which results in a low-temperature mixture of vapor and liquid the vapor-liquid mixture is then routed through the evaporator where it is vaporized by heat absorbed from the space being cooled the vaporized refrigerant flows to the compressor inlet to complete the cycle power recovery in fluid catalytic crackeredit the combustion flue gas from the catalyst regenerator of a fluid catalytic cracker is at a temperature of about 715c and at a pressure of about 2.4 barg  240 kpa gauge its gaseous components are mostly carbon monoxide co carbon dioxide co2 and nitrogen n2 although the flue gas has been through two stages of cyclones located within the regenerator to remove entrained catalyst fines it still contains some residual catalyst fines figure 5 depicts how power is recovered and utilized by routing the regenerator flue gas through a turboexpander after the flue gas exits the regenerator it is routed through a secondary catalyst separator containing swirl tubes designed to remove 70 to 90 percent of the residual catalyst fines 12 this is required to prevent erosion damage to the turboexpander as shown in figure 5 expansion of the flue gas through a turboexpander provides sufficient power to drive the regenerators combustion air compressor the electrical motor-generator in the power recovery system can consume or produce electrical power if the expansion of the flue gas does not provide enough power to drive the air compressor the electric motor-generator provides the needed additional power if the flue gas expansion provides more power than needed to drive the air compressor than the electric motor-generator converts the excess power into electric power and exports it to the refinerys electrical system 13 the steam turbine shown in figure 5 is used to drive the regenerators combustion air compressor during start-ups of the fluid catalytic cracker until there is sufficient combustion flue gas to take over that task the expanded flue gas is then routed through a steam-generating boiler referred to as a co boiler where the carbon monoxide in the flue gas is burned as fuel to provide steam for use in the refinery 13 the flue gas from the co boiler is processed through an electrostatic precipitator esp to remove residual particulate matter the esp removes particulates in the size range of 2 to 20 micrometers from the flue gas 13 historyedit the possible use of an expansion machine for isentropically creating low temperatures was suggested by carl wilhelm siemens siemens cycle a german engineer in 1857 about three decades later in 1885 ernest solvay of belgium attempted to use a reciprocating expander machine but could not attain any temperatures lower than −98c because of problems with lubrication of the machine at such temperatures 2 in 1902 georges claude a french engineer successfully used a reciprocating expansion machine to liquefy air he used a degreased burnt leather packing as a piston seal without any lubrication with an air pressure of only 40 bar  4 mpa claude achieved an almost isentropic expansion resulting in a lower temperature than had before been possible 2 the first turboexpanders seem to have been designed in about 1934 or 1935 by guido zerkowitz an italian engineer working for the german firm of linde ag 14 15 in 1939 the russian physicist pyotr kapitsa perfected the design of centrifugal turboexpanders his first practical prototype was made of monel metal had an outside diameter of only 8cm  3.1in operated at 40,000 revolutions per minute and expanded 1,000 cubic metres of air per hour it used a water pump as a brake and had an efficiency of 79 to 83 percent 2 15 most turboexpanders in industrial use since then have been based on kapitsas design and centrifugal turboexpanders have taken over almost 100 percent of the industrial gas liquefaction and low temperature process requirements 2 15 the availability of liquid oxygen revolutionized the production of steel using the basic oxygen steelmaking process in 1978 pyotr kapitsa was awarded a nobel physics prize for his body of work in the area of low-temperature physics 16 in 1983 san diego gas and electric was among the first to install a turboexpander in a natural gas letdown station for energy recovery 17 typesedit turboexpanders can be classified by loading device or bearings three main loading devices used in turboexpanders are centrifugal compressors electrical generators or hydraulic brakes with centrifugal compressors and electrical generators the shaft power from the turboexpander is recouped either to recompress the process gas or to generate electrical energy lowering utility bills hydraulic brakes are used when the turboexpander is very small and harvesting the shaft power is not economically justifiable bearings used are either oil bearings or magnetic bearings see alsoedit air separation dry gas seal flash evaporation gas compressor joule-thomson effect liquefaction of gases rankine cycle steam turbine vapor-compression refrigeration
