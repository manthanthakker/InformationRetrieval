quietrevolution wind turbine the quietrevolution is a discontinued brand of vawt vertical axis helical turbine the helical design is most similar to the gorlov helical turbine both are an evolution of the darrieus wind turbine it has won several awards including the sustainable innovation award in 2006 the turbine consists of three vertical airfoil blades each having a helical twist of 120 degrees this feature spreads the torque evenly over the entire revolution thus preventing the destructive pulsations of the straight-bladed giromill darrieus turbine the wind pushes each blade around on both the windward and leeward sides of the turbine the qr5 turbine rated for 6 kw measures 3.0m in diameter by 5m high poor performance of a qr5 installed at welsh government offices in aberystwyth has been blamed on poor siting 1 the turbines overall cost was given as £48,000 and in 2012 it generated an average of 33kwh per month a value of £5.28 per month see alsoedit energy portal list of wind turbine manufacturers distributed generation net metering betz law referencesedit external linksedit quietrevolution quiet revolution goes quiet maker of qr5 vawt files for bankruptcy quiet revolution ltd  appointment of liquidators  the gazette v t e environmental impact high-altitude history land vehicles offshore turbines on public display windmill on public display aerodynamics airborne crosswind kite darrieus design floating savonius small unconventional vertical axis consulting companies farm management manufacturers software windmade community-owned farms by country offshore farms by country onshore farms by country betzs law capacity factor eroei forecasting grid energy storage hvdc intermittency variability laddermill net energy gain resource assessment storage subsidies virtual power plant wind hybrid power systems wind profile power law v t e
