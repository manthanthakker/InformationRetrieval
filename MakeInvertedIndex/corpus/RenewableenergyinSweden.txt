electricity heatingcooling and transportation - by 2020 10 eurostat reported that sweden had already exceeded the directives 2020 target in 2014 11 in 2013 renewable energy investment was more than us$1 billion in sweden 12 wind poweredit wind power accounted for 2.4 of the electricity production in sweden in 2010 5 in 2012 13 14 sweden has wind power potential of 510 twha at land and 46 twha at sea  15 consumption was 140 twh of power in 2010 in 2013 sweden was second top country for wind power capacity per inhabitant in the world 488 w per person 16 in correlation one must note that swedish use of energy per inhabitant is much higher than average in europe wave poweredit sweden has a wave power station outside lysekil hydroelectric poweredit hydroelectric power in sweden accounts for more than half of energy production more than 1900 power stations operate all over the country forty-five produce 100 mw and over 17 produce 200 mw and over and 6 produce 400 mw and over the largest station which is located on the upper lule river has a maximum production capacity of 977 mw the lule river is also the most productive river with almost 18 of the swedish installed effect almost all of the medium to large plants are located in northern sweden solar poweredit while installations have historically been minimal solar power has recently been growing quickly in sweden with the countrys cumulative pv capacity nearly doubling in 2014 to 79 mw 21 biofuelsedit sweden aims for a fossil fuel free vehicle fleet by 2030  22 sweden published the sustainability criteria for biofuels  2011 which consider the areas with high biological values to be protected in respect to fuels production the feedstock origin used for production of bioliquids in sweden during 2011 was sweden 49 the netherlands 17 united states 17 finland 6 belgium 3 and other 8 brazil malaysia and russia palm oil is often pointed out as a dirty feed-stock for biofuels none of the swedish companies used palm oil in 2011 the largest share of feedstock for bioliquids comes from the forest industry in the form of tall oil pitch tall oil and methanol 23 in 2013 the bus fleets in more than a dozen cities relied entirely on biomethane local plants produced more than 60 of the total biomethane used in swedish natural gas vehicles and more filling stations were opened in 2012 and 2013 goteborg energi gothenburg energy has a 20 mw facility that gasifies forest residues and then converts the synthesis gaseshydrogen and carbon monoxideinto biomethane  24 thermal and nuclearedit nuclear is dominating in this sector the other operational plant is in almost all cases fueled with renewable fuels oil plants are few and are either decommissioned or used as a reserve nuclear poweredit more than 35 of the swedish electricity is produced by 10 nuclear reactors spread out on 3 power stations ringhals nuclear power plant - 3 pressurized water reactor 1 boiling water reactor ~4,2 gw oskarshamn nuclear power plant - 3 bwrs one of them is also worlds largest bwr ~2,6 gw forsmark nuclear power plant - 3 bwrs ~3,2 gw before 2005 there were 12 reactors but the two bwr reactors ~1,2 gw at the barsebäck nuclear power plant were decommissioned in 1999 and 2005 global warmingedit according to energy information administration the co2 emissions from energy consumption of sweden were in 2009 54.77 mt slightly below finland 54.86 mt despite the difference in the population 25 the emissions per capita were in sweden 5.58 and in finland 9.93 tonnes per capita in 2009 26 see alsoedit electricity sector in sweden wind power in sweden biofuel in sweden nordic energy market renewable energy in norway renewable energy in finland renewable energy in denmark renewable energy by country referencesedit v t e prehistory 800–1521 kalmar union 1523–1611 rise to become great power swedish empire great northern war age of liberty absolute monarchy swedennorway union modernization industrialization world war ii 1945–1989 since 1989 cities counties extreme points forests islands lakes lands national parks nuts of sweden provinces rivers administrative division constitution elections foreign relations government agencies judiciary law law enforcement legislature armed forces army navy air force home guard radio establishment agencies army navy air force home guard radio establishment monarchy political parties agriculture automotive industry energy krona currency labour unions rehnmeidner model stock exchange taxation telecommunications transport tourism crime demographics education healthcare immigration languages lgbt history people welfare anthem architecture art cinema coat of arms cuisine fashion flag literature media television music national day public holidays religion sport television outline book category portal v t e austria belgium bulgaria croatia cyprus czech republic denmark estonia finland france germany greece hungary ireland italy latvia lithuania luxembourg malta netherlands poland portugal romania slovakia slovenia spain sweden united kingdom albania andorra armenia azerbaijan belarus bosnia and herzegovina georgia iceland kazakhstan liechtenstein macedonia moldova monaco montenegro norway russia san marino serbia switzerland turkey ukraine abkhazia kosovo nagorno-karabakh northern cyprus south ossetia transnistria åland faroe islands gibraltar guernsey isle of man jersey svalbard european union v t e austria belgium bulgaria croatia cyprus czech republic denmark estonia finland france germany greece hungary ireland italy latvia lithuania luxembourg malta netherlands poland portugal romania slovakia slovenia spain sweden united kingdom albania andorra armenia azerbaijan belarus bosnia and herzegovina georgia iceland kazakhstan liechtenstein macedonia moldova monaco montenegro norway russia san marino serbia switzerland turkey ukraine abkhazia kosovo nagorno-karabakh northern cyprus south ossetia transnistria åland faroe islands gibraltar guernsey isle of man jersey svalbard european union v t e ethiopia kenya morocco seychelles afghanistan bangladesh bhutan china india kazakhstan nepal pakistan philippines taiwan thailand european union czech republic denmark finland germany greece hungary ireland italy lithuania luxembourg netherlands portugal spain sweden united kingdom albania iceland norway russia canada costa rica honduras mexico united states australia new zealand tuvalu argentina brazil chile colombia
