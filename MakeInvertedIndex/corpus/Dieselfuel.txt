diesel fuel diesel fuel ˈdiːzəl in general is any liquid fuel used in diesel engines whose fuel ignition takes place without spark as a result of compression of the inlet air mixture and then injection of fuel glow plugs grid heaters and heater blocks help achieve high temperatures for combustion during engine startup in cold weather diesel engines have found broad use as a result of higher thermodynamic efficiency and thus fuel efficiency this is particularly noted where diesel engines are run at part-load as their air supply is not throttled as in a petrol engine their efficiency still remains very high the most common type of diesel fuel is a specific fractional distillate of petroleum fuel oil but alternatives that are not derived from petroleum such as biodiesel biomass to liquid btl or gas to liquid gtl diesel are increasingly being developed and adopted to distinguish these types petroleum-derived diesel is increasingly called petrodiesel 1 ultra-low-sulfur diesel ulsd is a standard for defining diesel fuel with substantially lowered sulfur contents as of 2016 almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in uk europe and north america is of a ulsd type in the uk diesel fuel for on-road use is commonly abbreviated derv standing for diesel-engined road vehicle which carries a tax premium over equivalent fuel for non-road use see taxation 2

fuel originated from experiments conducted by german scientist and inventor rudolf diesel for his compression-ignition engine he invented in 1892 diesel originally designed his engine to use coal dust as fuel 4 and experimented with other fuels including vegetable oils 5 such as peanut oil which was used to power the engines which he exhibited at the 1900 paris exposition and the 1911 worlds fair in paris 6 typesedit diesel fuel is produced from various sources the most common being petroleum other sources include biomass animal fat biogas natural gas and coal liquefaction petroleum dieseledit petroleum diesel also called petrodiesel 7 or fossil diesel is the most common type of diesel fuel it is produced from the fractional distillation of crude oil between 200c  392f and 350c  662f at atmospheric pressure resulting in a mixture of carbon chains that typically contain between 8 and 21 carbon atoms per molecule 8 synthetic dieseledit synthetic diesel can be produced from any carbonaceous material including biomass biogas natural gas coal and many others the raw material is gasified into synthesis gas which after purification is converted by the fischertropsch process to a synthetic diesel 9 the process is typically referred to as biomass-to-liquid btl gas-to-liquid gtl or coal-to-liquid ctl depending on the raw material used paraffinic synthetic diesel generally has a near-zero content of sulfur and very low aromatics content reducing unregulated emissions of toxic hydrocarbons nitrous oxides and particulate matter pm 10 biodieseledit fatty-acid methyl ester fame more widely known as biodiesel is obtained from vegetable oil or animal fats biolipids which have been transesterified with methanol it can be produced from many types of oils the most common being rapeseed oil rapeseed methyl ester rme in europe and soybean oil soy methyl ester sme in the us methanol can also be replaced with ethanol for the transesterification process which results in the production of ethyl esters the transesterification processes use catalysts such as sodium or potassium hydroxide to convert vegetable oil and methanol into fame and the undesirable byproducts glycerine and water which will need to be removed from the fuel along with methanol traces fame can be used pure b100 in engines where the manufacturer approves such use but it is more often used as a mix with diesel bxx where xx is the biodiesel content in percent 11 12 fame as a fuel is regulated under din en 14214 13 and astm d6751 14 fame has a lower energy content than diesel due to its oxygen content and as a result performance and fuel consumption can be affected it also can have higher levels of nox emissions possibly even exceeding the legal limit fame also has lower oxidation stability than diesel and it offers favorable conditions for bacterial growth so applications which have a low fuel turnover should not use fame 15 the loss in power when using pure biodiesel is 5–7 12 fuel equipment manufacturers fie have raised several concerns regarding fame fuels free methanol dissolved and free water free glycerin mono and diglycerides free fatty acids total solid impurity levels alkaline metal compounds in solution and oxidation and thermal stability they have also identified fame as being the cause of the following problems corrosion of fuel injection components low-pressure fuel system blockage increased dilution and polymerization of engine sump oil pump seizures due to high fuel viscosity at low temperature increased injection pressure elastomeric seal failures and fuel injector spray blockage 16 unsaturated fatty acids are the source for the lower oxidation stability they react with oxygen and form peroxides and result in degradation byproducts which can cause sludge and lacquer in the fuel system 17 as fame contains low levels of sulfur the emissions of sulfur oxides and sulfates major components of acid rain are low use of biodiesel also results in reductions of unburned hydrocarbons carbon monoxide co and particulate matter co emissions using biodiesel are substantially reduced on the order of 50 compared to most petrodiesel fuels the exhaust emissions of particulate matter from biodiesel have been found to be 30 lower than overall particulate matter emissions from petrodiesel the exhaust emissions of total hydrocarbons a contributing factor in the localized formation of smog and ozone are up to 93 lower for biodiesel than diesel fuel biodiesel also may reduce health risks associated with petroleum diesel biodiesel emissions showed decreased levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah and nitrited pah compounds which have been identified as potential cancer-causing compounds in recent testing pah compounds were reduced by 75–85 except for benzaanthracene which was reduced by roughly 50 targeted npah compounds were also reduced dramatically with biodiesel fuel with 2-nitrofluorene and 1-nitropyrene reduced by 90 and the rest of the npah compounds reduced to only trace levels 18 hydrogenated oils and fatsedit this category of diesel fuels involves converting the triglycerides in vegetable oil and animal fats into alkanes by refining and hydrogenation such as h-bio the produced fuel has many properties that are similar to synthetic diesel and are free from the many disadvantages of fame dmeedit dimethyl ether dme is a synthetic gaseous diesel fuel that results in clean combustion with very little soot and reduced nox emissions 19 storageedit in the us diesel is recommended to be stored in a yellow container to differentiate it from kerosene and gasoline which are typically kept in blue and red containers respectively 20 in the uk diesel is normally stored in a black container to differentiate it from unleaded petrol which is commonly stored in a green container and leaded petrol which is stored in a red container 21 measurements and pricingedit cetane numberedit the principal measure of diesel fuel quality is its cetane number a cetane number is a measure of the delay of ignition of a diesel fuel 22 a higher cetane number indicates that the fuel ignites more readily when sprayed into hot compressed air 22 european en 590 standard road diesel has a minimum cetane number of 51 fuels with higher cetane numbers normally premium diesel fuels with additional cleaning agents and some synthetic content are available in some markets fuel value and priceedit as of 2010 the density of petroleum diesel is about 0.832kgl  6.943lbusgal about 11.6 more than ethanol-free petrol gasoline which has a density of about 0.745kgl  6.217lbusgal about 86.1 of the fuel mass is carbon and when burned it offers a net heating value of 43.1 mjkg as opposed to 43.2 mjkg for gasoline however due to the higher density diesel offers a higher volumetric energy density at 35.86 mjl  128,700btuusgal vs 32.18 mjl  115,500btuusgal for gasoline some 11 higher which should be considered when comparing the fuel efficiency by volume the co2 emissions from diesel are 73.25 gmj just slightly lower than for gasoline at 73.38 gmj 23 diesel is generally simpler to refine from petroleum than gasoline and contains hydrocarbons having a boiling point in the range of 180–360c  360–680f the price of diesel traditionally rises during colder months as demand for heating oil rises which is refined in much the same way because of recent changes in fuel quality regulations additional refining is required to remove sulfur which contributes to a sometimes higher cost in many parts of the united states and throughout the united kingdom and australia 24 diesel may be priced higher than petrol 25 reasons for higher-priced diesel include the shutdown of some refineries in the gulf of mexico diversion of mass refining capacity to gasoline production and a recent transfer to ultra-low-sulfur diesel ulsd which causes infrastructural complications 26 in sweden a diesel fuel designated as mk-1 class 1 environmental diesel is also being sold this is a ulsd that also has a lower aromatics content with a limit of 5 27 this fuel is slightly more expensive to produce than regular ulsd taxationedit diesel fuel is very similar to heating oil which is used in central heating in europe the united states and canada taxes on diesel fuel are higher than on heating oil due to the fuel tax and in those areas heating oil is marked with fuel dyes and trace chemicals to prevent and detect tax fraud untaxed diesel sometimes called off-road diesel is available in some countries for use primarily in agricultural applications such as fuel for tractors recreational and utility vehicles or other noncommercial vehicles that do not use public roads this fuel may have sulfur levels that exceed the limits for road use in some countries eg us this untaxed diesel is dyed red for identification 28 and using this untaxed diesel fuel for a typically taxed purpose such as driving use the user can be fined eg us$10,000 in the us in the united kingdom belgium and the netherlands it is known as red diesel or gas oil and is also used in agricultural vehicles home heating tanks refrigeration units on vanstrucks which contain perishable items such as food and medicine and for marine craft diesel fuel or marked gas oil is dyed green in the republic of ireland and norway the term diesel-engined road vehicle derv is used in the uk as a synonym for unmarked road diesel fuel in india taxes on diesel fuel are lower than on petrol as the majority of the transportation for grain and other essential commodities across the country runs on diesel taxes on biodiesel in the us vary between states some states texas for example have no tax on biodiesel and a reduced tax on biodiesel blends equivalent to the amount of biodiesel in the blend so that b20 fuel is taxed 20 less than pure petrodiesel 29 other states such as north carolina tax biodiesel in any blended configuration the same as petrodiesel although they have introduced new incentives to producers and users of all biofuels 30 usesedit unlike gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas engines diesel engines do not use high-voltage spark ignition spark plugs an engine running on diesel compresses the air inside the cylinder to high pressures and temperatures compression ratios from 14:1 to 18:1 are common in current diesel engines the engine generally injects the diesel fuel directly into the cylinder starting a few degrees before top dead center tdc and continuing during the combustion event the high temperatures inside the cylinder cause the diesel fuel to react with the oxygen in the mix burn or oxidize heating and expanding the burning mixture to convert the thermalpressure difference into mechanical work ie to move the piston engines have glow plugs and grid heaters to help start the engine by preheating the cylinders to a minimum operating temperature diesel engines are lean burn engines 31 burning the fuel in more air than is needed for the chemical reaction they thus use less fuel than rich burn spark ignition engines which use a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio just enough air to react with the fuel as professor harvey of the university of toronto notes due to the absence of throttling constant amount of air admitted per unit fuel with no user-determined variation and the high compression ratio and lean fuel mixture diesel engines are substantially more efficient than spark-ignited engines generally harvey cites the side-by-side comparisons of schipper et al and the estimates of >20 lower fuel use and given difference in differences in energy content between fuel types >15 lower energy use 32 gas turbine and some other types of internal combustion engines and external combustion engine both can also be designed to take diesel fuelcitation needed the viscosity requirement of diesel fuel is usually specified at 40c 22 a disadvantage of diesel as a vehicle fuel in cold climates is that its viscosity increases as the temperature decreases changing it into a gel see compression ignition  gelling that cannot flow in fuel systems special low-temperature diesel contains additives to keep it liquid at lower temperatures but starting a diesel engine in very cold weather may still pose considerable difficulties another disadvantage of diesel engines compared to petrolgasoline engines is the possibility of diesel engine runaway failure since diesel engines do not need spark ignition they can run as long as diesel fuel is supplied fuel is typically supplied via a fuel pump if the pump breaks down in an open position the supply of fuel will be unrestricted and the engine will run away and risk terminal failure 33 with turbocharged engines the oil seals on the turbocharger may fail allowing lubricating oil into the combustion chamber where it is burned like regular diesel fuel in vehicles or installations that use diesel engines and also bottled gas a gas leak into the engine room could also provide fuel for a runaway via the engine air intake 34 the crank case ventilation of modern road-use diesel engines is diverted into the intake manifold because ventilating the crank case into outside air is inadvisable due to lubricant mist it contains if the engines piston rings malfunction this will cause excessive pressure in the crank case forcing mist of engine lubricant into the intake manifold since most engines use oil which can be burnt in the same fashion as diesel this will result in diesel engine runaway to prevent that more premium crank case ventilation solutions are fitted with a filter to catch out lubricant mist most modern road use diesel engines are provided with an frp valve in the intake manifold usually mistaken by some as a petrol engine throttle body in most basic applications this valve will close a flow of air mixture to the engine when the vehicle is switched off preventing diesel engine runaway by starving the engine of oxygen this will also make standard shutdown much smoother by eliminating compression and decompression rattle by making the pistons effectively work in vacuum in more advanced control systems this frp valve can be shut by an electronic control unit when it senses runaway scenario trucksedit diesel fuel is widely used in most types of transportation trucks and buses which were often gasoline-powered in the 1920s through 1950s are now almost exclusively diesel-powered the gasoline-powered passenger automobile is the major exception diesel cars are less numerous worldwide railroadedit diesel displaced coal and fuel oil for steam-powered vehicles in the latter half of the 20th century and is now used almost exclusively for the combustion engines of self-powered rail vehicles locomotives and railcars 35 36 aircraftedit the first diesel-powered flight of a fixed-wing aircraft took place on the evening of 18 september 1928 at the packard proving grounds near utica michigan with captain lionel m woolson and walter lees at the controls the first official test flight was taken the next morning flying a stinson sm1b x7654 powered by a packard dr-980 9-cylinder diesel radial engine designed by woolson charles lindbergh flew the same aircraft and in 1929 it was flown 621 miles  999km nonstop from detroit to langley field near norfolk virginia in 1931 walter lees and fredrick brossy set the nonstop flight record flying a bellanca powered by a packard diesel for 84 hours and 32 minutes x7654 is now owned by greg herrick and is at the golden wings flying museum near minneapolis minnesota diesel engines for airships were developed in both germany and the united kingdom by daimler-benz and beardmore produced the daimler-benz db 602 and beardmore typhoon respectively the lz 129 hindenburg rigid airship was powered by four daimler-benz db 602 16-cylinder diesel engines each with 1,200hp  890kw available in bursts and 850 horsepower  630kw available for cruising 37 the beardmore typhoon powered the ill-fated r101 airship built for the empire airship programme in 1931 with a production run of at least 900 engines the most-produced aviation diesel engine in history was probably the junkers jumo 205 similar developments from the junkers motorenwerke and licence-built versions of the jumo 204 and jumo 205 boosted german diesel aero-engine production to at least 1000 examples the vast majority of which were liquid-cooled opposed-piston two-stroke engines in the soviet union significant progress towards practical diesel aero-engines was made by the tsiam tsentralnyy institut aviatsionnovo motorostroyeniya  central institute of aviation motors and particularly by ad charomskiy who nursed the charomskiy ach-30 into production and limited operational use 38 military vehiclesedit armored fighting vehicles use diesel because of its lower flammability risks and the engines higher provision of torque and lower likelihood of stalling 39 40 carsedit diesel-powered cars generally have a better fuel economy than equivalent gasoline engines and produce less greenhouse gas emission 41 their greater economy is due to the higher energy per-litre content of diesel fuel and the intrinsic efficiency of the diesel engine 42 while petrodiesels higher density results in higher greenhouse gas emissions per litre compared to gasoline 43 the 20–40 better fuel economy achieved by modern diesel-engined automobiles offsets the higher per-litre emissions of greenhouse gases and a diesel-powered vehicle emits 10–20 percent less greenhouse gas than comparable gasoline vehicles 44 45 46 biodiesel-powered diesel engines offer substantially improved emission reductions compared to petrodiesel or gasoline-powered engines while retaining most of the fuel economy advantages over conventional gasoline-powered automobiles 44 however the increased compression ratios mean there are increased emissions of oxides of nitrogen nox from diesel engines 47 this is compounded by biological nitrogen in biodiesel to make nox emissions the main drawback of diesel versus gasoline engines 47 tractors and heavy equipmentedit todays tractors and heavy equipment are mostly diesel-powered among tractors only the smaller classes may also offer gasoline engines the dieselization of tractors and heavy equipment began in germany before world war ii but was unusual in the united states until after that war during the 1950s and 1960s it progressed in the latter country as well tractors and heavy equipment were often multifuel in the 1920s through 1940s running spark-ignition and low-compression engines thus many farm tractors of the era could burn gasoline alcohol kerosene and any light grade of fuel oil such as diesel fuel heating oil or tractor vaporising oil according to whichever was most affordable in any region at any given time on us farms during this era the name distillate often referred to any of the aforementioned light fuel oils the engines did not start as well on distillate so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for cold starting and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later after warm-up to switch to distillate engine accessories such as vaporizers and radiator shrouds were also used both with the aim of capturing heat because when such an engine was run on distillate it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature dieselization with dedicated diesel engines high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and compression ignition replaced such systems and made more efficient use of the diesel fuel being burned other usesedit poor quality diesel fuel has been used as an extraction agent for liquidliquid extraction of palladium from nitric acid mixtures 48 such use has been proposed as a means of separating the fission product palladium from purex raffinate which comes from used nuclear fuel 48 in this system of solvent extraction the hydrocarbons of the diesel act as the diluent while the dialkyl sulfides act as the extractant 48 this extraction operates by a solvation mechanism 48 so far neither a pilot plant nor full scale plant has been constructed to recover palladium rhodium or ruthenium from nuclear wastes created by the use of nuclear fuel 49 diesel fuel is also often used as the main ingredient in oil-base mud drilling fluid 50 the advantage of using diesel is its low cost and that it delivers excellent results when drilling a wide variety of difficult strata including shale salt and gypsum formations 50 diesel-oil mud is typically mixed with up to 40 brine water 51 due to health safety and environmental concerns diesel-oil mud is often replaced with vegetable mineral or synthetic food-grade oil-base drilling fluids although diesel-oil mud is still in widespread use in certain regions 52 during development of rocket engines in germany during world war ii j-2 diesel fuel was used as the fuel component in several engines including the bmw 109-718 53 j-2 diesel fuel was also used as a fuel for gas turbine engines 53 chemical analysisedit chemical compositionedit petroleum-derived diesel is composed of about 75 saturated hydrocarbons primarily paraffins including n iso and cycloparaffins and 25 aromatic hydrocarbons including naphthalenes and alkylbenzenes 54 the average chemical formula for common diesel fuel is c12h23 ranging approximately from c10h20 to c15h28 55 chemical propertiesedit most diesel fuels freeze at common winter temperatures while the temperatures greatly vary 56 petrodiesel typically freezes around temperatures of −8.1c  17.5f whereas biodiesel freezes between temperatures of 2 to 15c  35 to 60f 56 the viscosity of diesel noticeably increases as the temperature decreases changing it into a gel at temperatures of −19c −2.2f to −15c  5f that cannot flow in fuel systems conventional diesel fuels vaporise at temperatures between 149c and 371c 22 conventional diesel flash points vary between 52 and 96c which makes it safer than petrol and unsuitable for spark-ignition engines 57 unlike petrol the flash point of a diesel fuel has no relation to its performance in an engine nor to its auto ignition qualities 22 hazardsedit reduction of sulfur emissionsedit in the past diesel fuel contained higher quantities of sulfur european emission standards and preferential taxation have forced oil refineries to dramatically reduce the level of sulfur in diesel fuels in the european union the sulfur content has dramatically reduced during the last 20 years automotive diesel fuel is covered in the european union by standard en 590 in the 1990s specifications allowed a content of 2000 ppm max of sulphur reduced to a limit of 350 ppm by the beginning of the 21st century with the introduction of euro 3 specifications the limit was lowered with the introduction of euro 4 by 2006 to 50 ppm ulsd ultra low sulfur diesel the standard currently in force in european europe for diesel fuel is the euro 5 with a maximum content of 10 ppmcitation needed in the united states more stringent emission standards have been adopted with the transition to ulsd starting in 2006 and becoming mandatory on june 1 2010 see also diesel exhaust us diesel fuel typically also has a lower cetane number a measure of ignition quality than european diesel resulting in worse cold weather performance and some increase in emissions 58 environment hazards of sulfuredit high levels of sulfur in diesel are harmful for the environment because they prevent the use of catalytic diesel particulate filters to control diesel particulate emissions as well as more advanced technologies such as nitrogen oxide nox adsorbers still under development to reduce emissions moreover sulfur in the fuel is oxidized during combustion producing sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide that in presence of water rapidly convert to sulfuric acid one of the chemical processes that results in acid rain however the process for lowering sulfur also reduces the lubricity of the fuel meaning that additives must be put into the fuel to help lubricate engines biodiesel and biodieselpetrodiesel blends with their higher lubricity levels are increasingly being utilized as an alternative the us annual consumption of diesel fuel in 2006 was about 190 billion litres  42 billion imperial gallons or 50 billion us gallons 59 algae microbes and water contaminationedit there has been much discussion and misunderstanding of algae in diesel fuel algae need light to live and grow as there is no sunlight in a closed fuel tank no algae can survive but some microbes can survive and feed on the diesel fuel 60 these microbes form a colony that lives at the interface of fuel and water they grow quite fast in warmer temperatures they can even grow in cold weather when fuel tank heaters are installed parts of the colony can break off and clog the fuel lines and fuel filters 61 water in fuel can damage a fuel injection pump some diesel fuel filters also trap water water contamination in diesel fuel can lead to freezing while in the fuel tank the freezing water that saturates the fuel will sometimes clog the fuel injector pump 62 once the water inside the fuel tank has started to freeze gelling is more likely to occur when the fuel is gelled it is not effective until the temperature is raised and the fuel returns to a liquid state road hazardedit petrodiesel spilled on a roadway poses a hazard to vehicles due to its high evaporation temperature after the light fractions have evaporated a greasy slick is left on the road which can destabilize moving vehicles causing them to skid diesel spills severely reduce tire grip and traction and have been implicated in many accidents the loss of traction is similar to that encountered on black ice diesel slicks are especially dangerous for two-wheeled vehicles such as
