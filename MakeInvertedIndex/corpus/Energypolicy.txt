ongoing the human dimensions of energy use are of increasing interest to business utilities and policymakers using the social sciences to gain insights into energy consumer behavior can empower policymakers to make better decisions about broad-based climate and energy options this could facilitate more efficient energy use renewable energy commercialization and carbon emission reductions 1 national energy policyedit measures used to produce an energy policyedit a national energy policy comprises a set of measures involving that countrys laws treaties and agency directives the energy policy of a sovereign nation may include one or more of the following measures statement of national policy regarding energy planning energy generation transmission and usage legislation on commercial energy activities trading transport storage etc legislation affecting energy use such as efficiency standards emission standards instructions for state-owned energy sector assets and organizations active participation in co-ordination of and incentives for mineral fuels exploration see geological survey and other energy-related research and development policy command fiscal policies related to energy products and services taxes exemptions subsidies  energy security and international policy measures such as international energy sector treaties and alliances general international trade agreements special relations with energy-rich countries including military presence andor domination international energy sector treaties and alliances general international trade agreements special relations with energy-rich countries including military presence andor domination frequently the dominant issue of energy policy is the risk of supply-demand mismatch see energy crisis current energy policies also address environmental issues see climate change particularly challenging because of the need to reconcile global objectives and international rules with domestic needs and laws 2 some governments state explicit energy policy but declared or not each government practices some type of energy policy economic and energy modelling can be used by governmental or inter-governmental bodies as an advisory and analysis tool see economic model poles factors within an energy policyedit there are a number of elements that are naturally contained in a national energy policy regardless of which of the above measures was used to arrive at the resultant policy the chief elements intrinsic to an energy policy are what is the extent of energy self-sufficiency for this nation where future energy sources will derive how future energy will be consumed eg among sectors what fraction of the population will be acceptable to endure energy poverty what are the goals for future energy intensity ratio of energy consumed to gdp what is the reliability standard for distribution reliability what environmental externalities are acceptable and are forecast what form of portable energy is forecast eg sources of fuel for motor vehicles how will energy efficient hardware eg hybrid vehicles household appliances be encouraged how can the national policy drive province state and municipal functions what specific mechanisms eg taxes incentives manufacturing standards are in place to implement the total policy what future consequences there will be for national security and foreign policy 3 state province or municipal energy policyedit even within a state it is proper to talk about energy policies in plural influential entities such as municipal or regional governments and energy industries will each exercise policy policy measures available to these entities are lesser in sovereignty but may be equally important to national measures in fact there are certain activities vital to energy policy which realistically cannot be administered at the national level such as monitoring energy conservation practices in the process of building construction which is normally controlled by state-regional and municipal building codes although can appear basic federal legislation americasedit braziledit brazil is the 10th largest energy consumer in the world and the largest in south america at the same time it is an important oil and gas producer in the region and the worlds second largest ethanol fuel producer the governmental agencies responsible for energy policy are the ministry of mines and energy mme the national council for energy policy cnpe in the portuguese-language acronym the national agency of petroleum natural gas and biofuels anp and the national agency of electricity aneel 4 5 state-owned companies petrobras and eletrobrás are the major players in brazils energy sector 6 canadaedit united statesedit europeedit european unionedit although the european union has legislated set targets and negotiated internationally in the area of energy policy for many years and evolved out of the european coal and steel community the concept of introducing a mandatory common european union energy policy was only approved at the meeting of the european council on october 27 2005 in london following this the first policy proposals energy for a changing world were published by the european commission on january 10 2007 the most well known energy policy objectives in the eu are 20/20/20 objectives binding for all eu member states the eu is planning to increase the share of renewable energy in its final energy use to 20 reduce greenhouse gases by 20 and increase energy efficiency by 20 7 germanyedit in september 2010 the german government adopted a set of ambition goals to transform their national energy system and to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95 by 2050 relative to 1990 8 this transformation become known as the energiewende subsequently the government decided to the phase-out the nations fleet of nuclear reactors to be complete by 2022 9 as of 2014 the country is making steady progress on this transition 10 united kingdomedit the energy policy of the united kingdom has achieved success in reducing energy intensity but still really high reducing energy poverty and maintaining energy supply reliability to datewhen the united kingdom has an ambitious goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions for future years but it is unclear whether the programs in place are sufficient to achieve this objective the way to be so efficient as france is still hard regarding energy self sufficiency the united kingdom policy does not address this issue other than to concede historic energy self sufficiency is currently ceasing to exist due to the decline of the north sea oil production with regard to transport the united kingdom historically has a good policy record encouraging public transport links with cities despite encountering problems with high speed trains which have the potential to reduce dramatically domestic and short-haul european flights the policy does not however significantly encourage hybrid vehicle use or ethanol fuel use options which represent viable short term means to moderate rising transport fuel consumption regarding renewable energy the united kingdom has goals for wind and tidal energy the white paper on energy 2007 set the target that 20 of the uks energy must come from renewable sources by 2020 the soviet union and russiaedit the soviet union was the largest energy provider in the world until the late 1980s russia one of the worlds energy superpowers is rich in natural energy resources the worlds leading net energy exporter and a major supplier to the european union the main document defining the energy policy of russia is the energy strategy which initially set out policy for the period up to 2020 later was reviewed amended and prolonged up to 2030 while russia has also signed and ratified the kyoto protocol asiaedit chinaedit indiaedit the energy policy of india is characterized by trades between four major drivers rapidly growing economy with a need for dependable and reliable supply of electricity gas and petroleum products increasing household incomes with a need for affordable and adequate supply of electricity and clean cooking fuels limited domestic reserves of fossil fuels and the need to import a vast fraction of the gas crude oil and petroleum product requirements and recently the need to import coal as well and indoor urban and regional environmental impacts necessitating the need for the adoption of cleaner fuels and cleaner technologies in recent years these challenges have led to a major set of continuing reforms restructuring and a focus on energy conservation thailandedit the energy policy of thailand is characterized by 1 increasing energy consumption efficiency 2 increasing domestic energy production 3 increasing the private sectors role in the energy sector 4 increasing the role of market mechanisms in setting energy prices these policies have been consistent since the 1990s despite various changes in governments the pace and form of industry liberalization and privatization has been highly controversial bangladeshedit the first national energy policy nep of bangladesh was formulated in 1996 by the ministry of power energy and mineral resources to ensure proper exploration production distribution and rational use of energy resources to meet the growing energy demands of different zones consuming sectors and consumers groups on a sustainable basis 1 with rapid change of global as well as domestic situation the policy was updated in 2004 the updated policy included additional objectives namely to ensure environmentally sound sustainable energy development programmes causing minimum damage to environment to encourage public and private sector participation in the development and management of energy sector and to bring the entire country under electrification by the year 2020 2 oceaniaedit australiaedit australias energy policy features a combination of coal
