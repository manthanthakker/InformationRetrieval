peak demand peak demand is used to refer to a historically high point in the sales record of a particular product in terms of energy use peak demand describes a period of simultaneous strong consumer demand or a period of highest demand in a billing period  contents 1 peak load 1.1 off-peak 1.2 response 1.3 power stations 2 see also 3 references 1.1 off-peak 1.2 response 1.3 power stations  peak loadedit peak demand peak load or on-peak are terms used in energy demand management describing a period in which electrical power is expected to be provided for a sustained period at a significantly higher than average supply level peak demand fluctuations may occur on daily monthly seasonal and yearly cycles for an electric utility company the actual point of peak demand is a single half-hour or hourly period which represents the highest point of customer consumption of electricity at this time there is a combination of office domestic demand and at some times of the year the fall of darkness 1 some utilities will charge customers based on their individual peak demand the highest demand during each month or even a single 15 to 30 minute period of highest use in the previous year may be used to calculate charges 2 off-peakedit peak demand is considered to be the opposite to off-peak hours when power demand is usually low there are off-peak time-of-use rates responseedit the maximum demand dictates the size of generators transmission lines transformers and circuit breakers for utilities even if that amount lasts just one hour per year 3 natural gas fueled power generators must all have adequately sized pipelines power generation which is able to be rapidly ramped up for peak demand often uses more expensive fuels is less efficient and has higher marginal carbon emissions 3 peak demand may exceed the maximum supply levels that the electrical power industry can generate resulting in power outages and load shedding this often occurs during heat waves when use of air conditioners and powered fans raises the rate of energy consumption significantly during a shortage authorities may request the public to curtail their energy use and shift it to a non-peak period power stationsedit power stations providing power to electrical grids for peak demand are called peaking power plants or peakers natural gas fueled power stations can be fired up rapidly and are therefore often utilized at peak demand times pumped storage type dams such as carters dam help to meet peak demand as well the chances that a wind farm will be unable to meet peak demand are greater than for a fossil-fueled power station due to the ability to store liquid fuels for use during peak demand 4 see alsoedit energy portal congestion pricing diversity factor merit order electricity market energy storage list of energy storage projects peak oil price elasticity of demand v2g referencesedit v t e availability factor base load black start capacity factor demand factor demand management eroei fault grid storage intermittency load factor load following nameplate capacity peak demand power quality power-flow study repowering variability coal fossil-fuel power station natural gas petroleum nuclear oil shale biomass biofuel geothermal hydro marine current osmotic thermal tidal wave solar wind current osmotic thermal tidal wave ac power cogeneration combined cycle cooling tower induction generator micro chp microgeneration rankine cycle three-phase electric power virtual power plant blackout rolling blackout brownout demand response distributed generation dynamic demand electric power distribution electric power system electric power transmission electrical grid high-voltage direct current load management pumped hydro power station power storage smart grid substation super grid transformer transmission system operator tso transmission tower utility pole arc-faultcircuitinterrupter earth leakage circuit breaker residual-current device gfi power-system protection protective relay digital protective relay sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker carbon offset cost of electricity by source ecotax energy subsidies feed-in tariff fossil-fuel phase-out net metering pigovian tax renewable energy certificates renewable energy payments renewable energy policy spark spread
