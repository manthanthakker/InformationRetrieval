green bank a green bank sometimes referred to as green investment bank clean energy finance authority or clean energy finance corporation 1 is a financial institution typically public or quasi-public that uses innovative financing techniques and market development tools in partnership with the private sector to accelerate deployment of clean energy technologies 2 green banks use public funds to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies that despite being commercially viable have struggled to establish a widespread presence in consumer markets 3 green banks seek to reduce energy costs for ratepayers stimulate private sector investment and economic activity and expedite the transition to a low-carbon economy in the united states green banks have been created at the state and local levels the united kingdom australia japan new york state and malaysia have all created national banks dedicated to leveraging private investment in clean energy technologies 4 together green banks around the world have driven approximately $20 billion of clean energy investment  contents 1 history 2 essential elements 3 market barriers 4 financing activities 4.1 credit enhancement

green bank concept was originally developed by reed hundt and ken berlin as a part of the 2008 obama-biden transition teams efforts to facilitate clean energy development 5 a similar concept was adopted as an amendment to the federal cap and trade bill called the american clean energy and security act introduced in may 2009 6 a companion piece of federal green financing legislation was simultaneously introduced in the senate where it received broad bipartisan support 7 when the 2009 cap and trade legislation ultimately failed to pass the senate green bank advocates in the us focused on the state level 5 connecticut established the first state green bank in 2011 followed by new york in 2013 by the end of fiscal year 2015 the connecticut green bank had supported $663 million in project investments in the uk in 2009 two reports were published advocating the creation of a state-backed infrastructure bank to provide financing to green projects the first entitled accelerating green infrastructure financing outline proposals for uk green bonds and infrastructure bank was published in march 2009 byclimate change capitaland e3g 8 the second entitled delivering a 21st century infrastructure for britain was published bypolicy exchangein september 2009 and was written bydieter helm james wardlaw andben caldecott 9 essential elementsedit there are many types and styles of institutions that finance clean energy and green infrastructure projects there are several key elements that distinguish green banks from other financing institutions a focus on commercially viable technologies a dedicated source of capital a focus on leveraging private investment and a relationship with government 2 green banks focus on commercially viable technologies as opposed to early-stage innovative technologies because they have been tested have less associated technology risk and can reliably produce revenue for project owners 10 green banks are public-purpose entities with some manner of a relationship with government and are usually capitalized by public dollars 2 just like a commercial bank green banks lend capital and own debt so it is important they have their own balance sheet green banks also focus on using their capital to facilitate private entry into the clean energy marketspecifically by using limited public dollars to leverage private investment in clean energy market barriersedit for consumers high upfront costs often make clean energy technology unattractive to adopt despite declines in clean energy technology costs 11 historically the clean energy sector has depended on taxpayer-funded grants rebates tax credits and other subsidies to drive market development 12 ideally private lenders would provide financing to building-owners to cover upfront cost of clean energy adoption beyond what is covered by rebates however there are capital market inefficiencies and inherent challenges to financing clean energy that have resulted in inadequate investment by private lenders some private lenders do offer for clean energy projects but typically charge interest rates that are relatively high and loan tenors that are short 13 such terms make financing a clean energy project unattractive from the end-users perspective to be attractive from the end-users perspective financing terms would be such that the monthly cash flow from clean energy projects would be greater than the monthly payments for the cost of financing this kind of cash flow structure is only possible with loan terms that match the expected lifetime of the projects savings and with rates that are commensurate with the risk therefore private capital offered at unfavorable terms if it is available at all undercuts the economic attractiveness of the project potential customers or project developers a shortfall of private financing exists for several reasons one reason is that there is a relatively short track record for clean energy financing and therefore there is little data for lenders to rely on 14 without data and observable pipeline of similar projects banks are left with high levels of uncertainty over how well different types of projects perform and how often borrowers repay their loans this uncertainty leads to either hesitation to enter the market high due diligence costs andor unfavorable lending terms another reason for the financing gap is that many clean energy projects are small and distributed building efficiency upgrades and rooftop solar projects are inherently small investments that are geographically dispersed with varying credit among counter parties heterogeneity in clean energy projects is more expensive for a private lender to underwrite at scale making loans for clean energy projects potentially uneconomical from the perspective of the lender 15 a third reason for the financing gap is the lack of capital market liquidity and maturity if a commercial bank provides an energy efficiency loan it is unknown to the bank if it will be able to sell that loan to another lender or if it will have to hold that loan on its balance sheet 16 mortgage and auto lenders dont have this difficulty because there are highly liquid secondary markets for home and car loans which helps keeps rates low these kinds of secondary markets are just now forming for clean energy technologies the final cause of private underinvestment relates to human and organizational behavior to begin lending into a new market a bank must hire new staff learn about the risks and processes of a new market and determine precise criteria for what kind of projects and credit ratings they are willing to lend to this process may be time-consuming financing activitiesedit to combat these barriers to clean energy market development green banks help consumers secure long-term low-interest loans green banks harness a diverse set of financing techniques including credit enhancements co-investment and securitization credit enhancementedit green banks frequently utilize credit enhancements to leverage private investment loan loss reserves overcollateralization and subordinated debt can help assuage concern among private lenders who are interested in entering the market but concerned about the risks associated with developers counter parties or technologies with less established history in their given jurisdiction credit enhancements also help lower the cost of capital for borrowers and improve debt ratings from credit agencies 2 co-investmentedit sometimes green banks invest directly in clean energy projects to facilitate additional private investment or improve the financial terms set by private lenders 2 securitizationedit securitizing clean energy loans makes lending far more attractive for private investors individual clean energy projects which vary in credit location and technology can be expensive for a bank to underwrite and may not achieve the desired scale of investment bundling these loans into portfolios and selling them or shares of them diffuses risk and creates scale attracting a broader group of private investors 2 a green bank can create and securitize portfolios of loans allowing investors can purchase some portion of the green banks debt on the secondary market green banks can also add credit enhancements such as overcollateralization or loan loss reserves to lower the creditors exposure to default risk and secure better ratings from credit rating agencies securitization provides greater liquidity in the market for clean energy project financing which helps lower the cost of capital for borrowers 2 the connecticut green bank executed one of the first such securitization deals selling 75 of its $40 million pace portfolio to clean fund a specialty finance company 17 financing structuresedit green banks innovative financing techniques are more effective if they can operate through robust delivery mechanisms green banks can use these structures to increase the security of debt service payments and allow lenders to offer lower interest rates for clean energy financing property assessed clean energyedit property assessed clean energy pace financing allows consumers to pay energy upgrade loans through property taxes the process places a lien on the property and the property owner then repays the financing through pace assessments on the property tax bill 2 this reduces the default risk associated with a loan and incentivizes private investment because the pace structure reduces risk it allows consumers to obtain lower interest rates on their loans 18 because the loans are attached to the property when property is sold the new owners take over loan repayment 2 on-bill financingedit on-bill financing permits consumers to repay energy upgrade loans through utility bills 2 similar to pace financing on-bill repayment affords lenders security in a developing market because electricity is a necessity utility bills have a very high rate of repayment nationwide placing loan payments on a utility bill increases their chances of being repaid appealing to private investors and facilitating affordable loans for consumers 2 also the on-bill structure enables renters to reap the benefits of added energy efficiency furthermore the simplicity of on-bill financing is attractiveit is logical that tenants pay for the good they consume market development activitiesedit sometimes the availability of clean energy financing products is not enough to stimulate the desired level of clean energy finance activity and various non-finance market development activities are necessary as well a green bank may design and execute various market development activities to build the market for clean energy market development activities may not directly involve lending and a green bank may hire an outside organization to design and perform these activities demand aggregationedit green banks or their partners can aggregate consumer demand for clean energy projects and financing to reduce customer acquisition costs for contractors and provide scale for investors 19 one means by which a green bank might aggregate demand is a neighborhood-wide group-buying deal the connecticut green bank and solarizect have used this technique throughout connecticut 20 contractor trainingedit a green bank can organize contractor trainings in which local clean energy technology installers contractors and developers learn about various green bank financing options contractor trainings allow contractors to use their knowledge of green bank financing products as a sales tool increasing the size and volume of the projects they do ensuring that contractors fully understand green bank financing is a crucial means of getting that information to the end-users of the financingbuilding owners rec financingedit innovative renewable energy credit rec financing plans have also helped green banks lower energy costs for consumers 21 green banks can agree to acquire and monetize the recs that will be produced by a given clean energy project after gaining possession of the recs through the financing agreement a green bank can then sell them to utilities as a result of this activity green banks can offer more favorable financing terms and utilities can obtain recs in large volumes potentially at below market prices reducing their cost of compliance and allowing them to pass savings on to their ratepayers 19 central clearinghouseedit green banks also operate as an interface between lenders and borrowers green banks can offer a central clearinghouse for all online data on energy resources including rebates and financing technical assistance for investors and project coordination services for contractors by facilitating transparency and accessibility of resources green banks bridge the gap between supply of and demand for capital for clean energy projects organizational structure and placementedit a green bank can take many forms green banks can be newly created entities or it can be created by repurposing an existing entity a green bank can be a direct part of government such as a subdivision of an existing agency the new york green bank for example is a division of the new york state energy research and development authority nyserda 22 a green bank can also be a quasi-public instrumentality such as a wholly owned non-profit public corporation the connecticut green bank for example is a quasi-public entity with both government officials and independent directors serving on its board 23 a green bank can also an independent non-profit entity administered by the government either through a contract or by purpose-building an entity to serve as green bank the montgomery county green bank for example is a non-profit organization that was purpose-built in accordance with legislation and serves as montgomery countys green bank as a result of a resolution of the county council 24 sources of capitaledit green banks are usually seeded with public capital and that capital can come from a wide variety of channels the green bank finance model preserves limited supplies of public capital allowing each dollar to be recycled continuously and utilized for multiple clean energy projects 2 ratepayer surchargeedit a state or local government may place a small surcharge on energy bills within its jurisdiction and may require that the funds raised by this charge be disbursed to a green bank or the government may repurpose an existing surcharge and direct the revenue to a green bank the surcharge can provide green banks with a yearly influx of capital 25 the connecticut green bank and new york green bank are capitalized in part by a systems benefit charge bond issuanceedit green banks can also issue bonds to obtain capital public sector bonds have the benefit of being tax exempt allowing governments and other public authorities to pay relatively low interest rates to bond owners a green banks bonding authority allows debt investors to secure a steady stream of payments from an institution with a low risk of default in exchange the green bank receives capital that it can immediately invest in clean energy deployment types of bondsedit green banks can be capitalized by bond issuances that are backed by state in which the green bank exists 26 green banks can also be capitalized by issuing bonds that are backed by the green bank itself 26 green banks can raise capital by issuing project bonds that are backed by the revenue-generating potential of the projects they will fund 26 revenue bonds from a dedicated cash stream other bonds backed by a dedicated cash stream such as ratepayer fees or by auctions of emissions allowances can be issued to generate capital for a green bank 26 if a green bank is short on capital it can securitize loans it has issued assets and through a secondary market sell them to another investor as a bond for example the connecticut green bank sold $30 million in bonds backed by commercial efficiency loans to clean fund 27 industrial revenue bonds and private activity bonds can be issued for certain green bank activities 26 revenue from carbon pricingedit green banks can also be partially capitalized by the revenue raised from various carbon pricing policies such as carbon taxes fees and cap-and-trade systems for example both the nygb and the cgb are capitalized in part by the revenue each state raises through the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi 12 direct budget appropriationedit a government can allocate dollars to a green bank as a part of its regular budget and appropriations process re-allocation of existing fundsedit sometimes an existing investment fund will be underused or completely unused it may be possible to re-allocate some such funds and put the dollars to work in a green bank 25 pension fundsedit pension funds can invest in deals or portfolios of deals generated by green banks 28 foundationsedit foundations can make grants to green banks to fund startup costs or they can make program-related investments in green banks and earn a return on their money in a way that is aligned with their mission 28 community development financial institutionsedit community development financial institutions cdfis can co-invest or provide startup capital for green banks cdfis can also provide important technical expertise in certain areas of green bank activity federal sources in the usedit the usda and its rural utilities service rus program provide funding for infrastructure projects including energy-related infrastructure to rural communities 29 the rus has funding available that could be used by green banks to finance projects in rural areas the united states department of energy doe has programs notably the loan program office lpo which provides federal dollars for innovative clean energy companies and project portfolios 30 a green bank could take advantage of doe money by building portfolios of projects designed to meet the standard set out by the lpo the united states environmental protection agency epa has a clean water state revolving fund cwsrf which makes low-cost financing available for various water and energy infrastructure projects 31 green banks can apply for access to these funds current green banksedit connecticut green bankedit the connecticut green bank cgb was established in 2011 and was the first green bank in the united states it is the most advanced green bank in the nation in terms of deal volume connecticuts legislature converted the connecticut clean energy fund a grant-focused promoter of clean energy investment into a deployment financing entity the cgb is quasi-public and its board of directors is composed of both government officials and independent directors 32 the cgb is continually capitalized by a systems benefit charge and revenue generated by connecticuts participation in the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi trading program 23 the bank also possesses the ability to issue its own bonds based on its balance sheet in its first four years of existence the cgb has stimulated $663.2 million of investment in clean energy projects three-fourths of which came from the private sector 23 the increase in clean energy investment coincided with a huge decline in the number of taxpayer-funded clean energy grants in effect the cgb increased clean energy investment while reducing taxpayers financial burden new york green bankedit governor andrew cuomo created the largest green bank in the nation ny green bank nygb and capitalized it through re-purposed ratepayer surcharges and revenues generated by the issuance of emissions permits 33 the new york energy office designed a 5-year capitalization structure with multiple infusions of capital summing to $1 billion 25 the nygb is now a fully staffed entity and operates as a wholesale clean energy finance lender as opposed to connecticut which operates more as a retail lender 34 rather than design specific financing products and programs the nygb relies on the market to learn what financing is needed to date the nygb has received over $1 billion in proposals and has an active project pipeline of $500 million 35 the first set of nygb investments were announced in the fall of 2015 36 the nygb used $49 million of public capital to leverage $178 million in private capital achieving a leverage ratio greater that 3:1 california cleen centeredit the california lending for energy and environmental needs center operates as the states green bank the cleen center exists within the california infrastructure and economic development bank one of the centers major initiativesthe statewide energy efficiency program sweepfinances energy efficiency projects and upgrades for municipalities universities schools and hospitals 37 unlike the connecticut and new york green banks the cleen center exclusively facilitates commercial projects and upgrades interested parties propose a project and apply for financial assistance with the cleen center cleen projects receive funding ranging from $500,000 to $30 million 3 hawaii green infrastructure authorityedit the hawaii green infrastructure authority was created in 2014 to finance clean energy development in hawaii the first program to be adopted was the green energy market securitization gems programan effort to provide the low-to-moderate income market with solar lease financing 38 for geographical reasons electricity is more expensive in hawaii than anywhere else in the united states the advent of solar leasing has allowed many hawaiian homeowners to install solar panels but solar market penetration has hardly reached low-credit households 3 the cash flow positive financing generated by gems is designed to help low-to-moderate income hawaiians enter a market from which they have historically been excluded rhode islandedit in 2015 state legislators converted the rhode island clean water finance agency ricwfa into the rhode island infrastructure bank riib 39 the riib offers both residential and commercial pace programs designed to reduce energy costs for consumers the riib also created the efficient buildings fund a program used to provide low-cost financing for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in public buildings 39 montgomery county mdedit montgomery county maryland is the only county in the us that has created a local green bank 40 the montgomery county green bank mcgb was capitalized with $20 million from the settlement that accompanied the merger of utilities pepco and exelon 41 malaysiaedit malaysias green technology financing corporation was launched in 2010 as a component of the governments national green technology policy 42 through the green technology financing scheme the corporation offers companies a 2 interest rate buy down and 60 guaranteed financing for green technology projects 43 united kingdomedit in 2012 the uk government created the uk green investment bank gib to attract private funds for the financing of the private sectors investments related to environmental preservation and improvement it is structured as a public limited company and is owned by the department for business innovation and skills bis its headquarters are in edinburgh where it is also registered and it has a secondary office in london 44 the gib works with a variety of technologies including energy efficiency waste and bioenergy offshore wind and onshore renewables 45 uks gib has committed £2.6 billion to 76 domestic infrastructure projects mobilizing over £10 billion of private investment 46 47 in march 2016 the uk government announced that it planned to move the gib to the private sector the government plans to sell its shares in the gib but will seek to retain a special share to ensure the continued protection of gibs green purposes 48 australiaedit australias clean energy finance corporation cefc was founded in 2012 with the purpose of mobilizing investment in renewable energy energy efficiency and low emissions technologies 49 at the beginning of fiscal year 2016 the cefc had invested $1.4 billion of its own capital and attracted $2.2 billion in private sector investment 50 green bank networkedit the green bank network is an international membership organization focusing on solutions to clean energy finance 51 it was launched at the 2015 cop21 meeting in paris by state and national green banks in connecticut australia malaysia new york japan and the united kingdom and the non-profits
