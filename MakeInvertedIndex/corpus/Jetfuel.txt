jet fuel jet fuel aviation turbine fuel atf or avtur is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines it is colorless to straw-colored in appearance the most commonly used fuels for commercial aviation are jet a and jet a-1 which are produced to a standardized international specification the only other jet fuel commonly used in civilian turbine-engine powered aviation is jet b which is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance jet fuel is a mixture of a large number of different hydrocarbons the range of their sizes molecular weights or carbon numbers is defined by the requirements for the product such as the freezing or smoke point kerosene-type jet fuel including jet a and jet a-1 has a carbon number distribution between about 8 and 16 carbon atoms per molecule wide-cut or naphtha-type jet fuel including jet b between about 5 and 15 1  contents 1 history 2 types 2.1 jet a 2.2 differences between jet a and jet a-1 2.3 typical

historyedit fuel for piston-engine powered aircraft usually a high-octane gasoline known as avgas has a low flash point to improve its ignition characteristics turbine engines can operate with a wide range of fuels and jet-aircraft engines typically use fuels with higher flash points which are less flammable and therefore safer to transport and handle the first axial compressor jet engine in widespread production and combat service the junkers jumo 004 used on the messerschmitt me 262a fighter and the arado ar 234b jet recon-bomber burned either a special synthetic j2 fuel or diesel fuel gasoline was a third option but unattractive due to high fuel consumption 2 other fuels used were kerosene or kerosene and gasoline mixtures most jet fuels in use since the end of world war ii are kerosene-based both british and american standards for jet fuels were first established at the end of world war ii british standards derived from standards for kerosene use for lampsknown as paraffin in the ukwhereas american standards derived from aviation gasoline practices over the subsequent years details of specifications were adjusted such as minimum freezing point to balance performance requirements and availability of fuels very low temperature freezing points reduce the availability of fuel higher flash point products required for use on aircraft carriers are more expensive to produce 3 in the united states astm international produces standards for civilian fuel types and the us department of defense produces standards for military use the british ministry of defence establishes standards for both civil and military jet fuels 3 for reasons of inter-operational ability british and united states military standards are harmonized to a degree in russia and former soviet union countries grades of jet fuels are covered by the state standard gost number or a technical condition number with the principal grade available in russia and members of the cis being ts-1 typesedit jet aedit jet a specification fuel has been used in the united states since the 1950s and is usually not available outside the united states 4 and a few canadian airports such as toronto and vancouver 5 whereas jet a-1 is the standard specification fuel used in the rest of the world other than the former soviet states where ts-1 is the most common standard both jet a and jet a-1 have a flash point higher than 38c  100f with an autoignition temperature of 210c  410f 6 differences between jet a and jet a-1edit the primary difference is the lower freezing point of a-1 4 jet as is −40c −40f jet a-1s is −47c −53f the other difference is the mandatory addition of an anti-static additive to jet a-1 jet a trucks storage tanks and plumbing that carry jet a are marked with a black sticker with jet a in white printed on it adjacent to another black stripe typical physical properties for jet a and jet a-1edit jet a-1 fuel must meet def stan 91-91 jet a-1 astm specification d1655 jet a-1 and iata guidance material kerosene type nato code f-35 jet a fuel must reach astm specification d1655 jet a 7 typical physical properties for jet a  jet a-1 8 jet bedit jet b is a fuel in the naphtha-kerosene region that is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance however jet bs lighter composition makes it more dangerous to handle 7 for this reason it is rarely used except in very cold climates a blend of approximately 30 kerosene and 70 gasoline it is known as wide-cut fuel it has a very low freezing point of −60c −76f and a low flash point as well it is primarily used in some military aircraft it is also used in canada alaska and sometimes russia because of its low freezing point additivesedit the def stan 91-91 uk and astm d1655 international specifications allow for certain additives to be added to jet fuel including 12 13 antioxidants to prevent gumming usually based on alkylated phenols eg ao-30 ao-31 or ao-37 antistatic agents to dissipate static electricity and prevent sparking stadis 450 with dinonylnaphthylsulfonic acid dinnsa as a component is an example corrosion inhibitors eg dci-4a used for civilian and military fuels and dci-6a used for military fuels fuel system icing inhibitor fsii agents eg di-egme fsii is often mixed at the point-of-sale so that users with heated fuel lines do not have to pay the extra expense biocides are to remediate microbial ie bacterial and fungal growth present in aircraft fuel systems currently two biocides are approved for use by most aircraft and turbine engine original equipment manufacturers oems kathon fp1.5 microbiocide and biobor jf 14 metal deactivator can be added to remediate the deleterious effects of trace metals on the thermal stability of the fuel the one allowable additive is nn-disalicylidene 1,2-propanediamine as the aviation industrys jet kerosene demands have increased to more than 5 of all refined products derived from crude it has been necessary for the refiner to optimize the yield of jet kerosene a high value product by varying process techniques new processes have allowed flexibility in the choice of crudes the use of coal tar sands as a source of molecules and the manufacture of synthetic blend stocks due to the number and severity of the processes used it is often necessary and sometimes mandatory to use additives these additives may for example prevent the formation of harmful chemical species or improve a property of a fuel to prevent further engine wear water in jet fueledit it is very important that jet fuel be free from water contamination during flight the temperature of the fuel in the tanks decreases due to the low temperatures in the upper atmosphere this causes precipitation of the dissolved water from the fuel the separated water then drops to the bottom of the tank because it is denser than the fuel since the water is no longer in solution it can form droplets which can supercool to below 0c if these supercooled droplets collide with a surface they can freeze and may result in blocked fuel inlet pipes 15 this was the cause of the british airways flight 38 accident removing all water from fuel is impractical therefore fuel heaters are usually used on commercial aircraft to prevent water in fuel from freezing there are several methods for detecting water in jet fuel a visual check may detect high concentrations of suspended water as this will cause the fuel to become hazy in appearance an industry standard chemical test for the detection of free water in jet fuel uses a water-sensitive filter pad that turns green if the fuel exceeds the specification limit of 30ppm parts per million free water 16 a critical test to rate the ability of jet fuel to release emulsified water when passed through coalescing filters is astm standard d3948 standard test method for determining water separation characteristics of aviation turbine fuels by portable separometer military jet fuelsedit military organizations around the world use a different classification system of jp for jet propellant numbers some are almost identical to their civilian counterparts and differ only by the amounts of a few additives jet a-1 is similar to jp-8 jet b is similar to jp-4 17 other military fuels are highly specialized products and are developed for very specific applications jet fuels are sometimes classified as kerosene or naphtha-type 3 kerosene-type fuels include jet a jet a-1 jp-5 and jp-8 naphtha-type jet fuels sometimes referred to as wide-cut jet fuel include jet b and jp-4 3 the jp-4 and jp-5 fuels covered by the mil-dtl-5624 and meeting the british specification def stan 91-86 avcatfsii formerly derd 2452 22 are intended for use in aircraft turbine engines these fuels require military-unique additives that are necessary in military weapon systems engines and missions piston engine useedit jet fuel is very similar to diesel fuel and in some cases may be burned in diesel engines the possibility of environmental legislation banning the use of leaded avgas and the lack of a replacement fuel with similar performance has left aircraft designers and pilots organizations searching for alternative engines for use in small aircraft 26 as a result a few aircraft engine manufacturers most notably thielert and austro engine have begun offering aircraft diesel engines which run on jet fuel this technology has potential to simplify airport logistics by reducing the number of fuel types required jet fuel is available in most places in the world whereas avgas is only widely available in a few countries which have a large number of general aviation aircraft a diesel engine may also potentially be more environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient than an avgas engine however very few diesel aircraft engines have been certified by aviation authorities diesel aircraft engines are uncommon today even though opposed-piston aviation diesel powerplants such as the junkers jumo 205 family had been used during the second world war jet fuel is often used in ground support vehicles at airports instead of diesel the united states military makes heavy use of jp-8 for instance however jet fuel tends to have poor lubricating ability in comparison to diesel thereby increasing wear on fuel pumps and other related engine partscitation needed civilian vehicles tend to disallow its use or require that an additive be mixed with the jet fuel to restore its lubricity jet fuel is more expensive than diesel fuel but the logistical advantages of using one fuel can offset the extra expense of its use in certain circumstances jet fuel contains more sulfur up to 1,000ppm which therefore means it is more lubricative and does not currently require a lubricity additive as all pipeline diesel fuels require the introduction of ultra low sulfur diesel or ulsd brought with it the need for lubricity modifiers pipeline diesels before ulsd were able to contain up to 500ppm of sulfur and was called low sulfur diesel or lsd lsd is now only available to the off-road construction locative and marine markets as more epa regulations are introduced more refineries are hydrotreating their jet fuel production thus limiting the lubricating abilities of jet fuel as determined by astm standard d445 synthetic jet fueledit a significant effort is under way to certify fischertropsch ft synthesized paraffinic kerosene spk synthetic fuels for use in united states and international aviation fleets in this effort is being led by an industry coalition known as the commercial aviation alternative fuels initiative caafi 27 also supported by a parallel initiative under way in the usaf 28 to certify ft fuel for use in all aviation platforms the usaf has a stated goal of certifying its entire fleet for use with ft synthetic fuel blends by 2011 29 the caafi initiative aims to certify the civilian aviation fleet for ft synthetic fuels blends by 2010 and has programs under way to certify hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids hefa aka hydrogenated renewable jet hrj spk biofuels as early as 2013 30 hydroprocessed and hydrotreated have also been used in lieu of hydrogenated both ft and hefa based spks blended with jp-8 are specified in mil-dtl-83133h synthetic jet fuels show a reduction in pollutants such as sox nox particulate matter and hydrocarbon emissions 31 it is envisaged that usage of synthetic jet fuels will increase air quality around airports which will be particularly advantageous at inner city airports 32 qatar airways became the first airline to operate a commercial flight on a 50:50 blend of synthetic gas to liquid gtl jet fuel and conventional jet fuel the natural gas derived synthetic kerosene for the six-hour flight from london to doha came from shells gtl plant in bintulu malaysia 33 the worlds first passenger aircraft flight to use only synthetic jet fuel was from lanseria international airport to cape town international airport on september 22 2010 the fuel was developed by sasol 34 chemist heather willauer is leading a team of researchers at the us naval research laboratory who are developing a process to make jet fuel from seawater the technology requires an input of electrical energy to separate carbon dioxide co2 and hydrogen h2 gas from seawater using an iron-based catalyst followed by an oligomerization step wherein carbon monoxide co and hydrogen are recombined into long-chain hydrocarbons using zeolite as the catalyst the technology is expected to be deployed in the 2020s by us navy warships especially nuclear-powered aircraft carriers 35 36 37 38 39 40 usaf synthetic fuel trialsedit on august 8 2007 air force secretary michael wynne certified the b-52h as fully approved to use the ft blend marking the formal conclusion of the test program this program is part of the department of defense assured fuel initiative an effort to develop secure domestic sources for the military energy needs the pentagon hopes to reduce its use of crude oil from foreign producers and obtain about half of its aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2016 with the b-52 now approved to use the ft blend the usaf will use the test protocols developed during the program to certify the c-17 globemaster iii and then the b-1b to use the fuel to test these two aircraft the usaf has ordered 281,000usgal  1,060,000l of ft fuel the usaf intends to test and certify every airframe in its inventory to use the fuel by 2011 they will also supply over 9,000 us gallons  34,000l 7,500impgal to nasa for testing in various aircraft and enginesneeds update the usaf has certified the b-1b b-52h c-17 c-130j f-4 as qf-4 target drones f-15 f-22 and t-38 to use the synthetic fuel blend 41 the us air forces c-17 globemaster iii f-16 and f-15 are certified for use of hydrotreated renewable jet fuels 42 43 the usaf plans to certify over 40 models for fuels derived from waste oils and plants by 2013 43 the us army is considered one of the few customers of biofuels large enough to potentially bring biofuels up to the volume production needed to reduce costs 43 the us navy has also flown a boeing fa-18ef super hornet dubbed the green hornet at 1.7 times the speed of sound using a biofuel blend 43 the defense advanced research projects agency darpa funded a $6.7 million project with honeywell uop to develop technologies to create jet fuels from biofeedstocks for use by the united states and nato militaries 44 jet biofuelsedit the air transport industry is responsible for 1 percent of man-made carbon dioxide emitted 45 boeing estimates that biofuels could reduce flight-related greenhouse-gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent one possible solution which has received more media coverage than others would be blending synthetic fuel derived from algae with existing jet fuel 46 green flight international became the first airline to fly jet aircraft on 100 biofuel the flight from reno stead airport in stead nevada was in an aero l-29 delfín piloted by carol sugars and douglas rodante 47 boeing and air new zealand are collaborating with tecbio 48 aquaflow bionomic and other jet biofuel developers around the world virgin atlantic successfully tested a biofuel blend consisting of 20 percent babassu nuts and coconut and 80 percent conventional jet fuel which was fed to a single engine on a 747 flight from london heathrow to amsterdam schiphol 49 a consortium consisting of boeing nasas glenn research center mtu aero engines germany and the us air force research laboratory is working on development of jet fuel blends containing a substantial percentage of biofuel 50 british airways and solena group are establishing a sustainable jet fuel plant in east london uk as ba plans to use the biofuel to power part of its fleet from 2014 51 24 commercial and military biofuel flights have taken place using honeywell green jet fuel including a navy fa-18 hornet 52 in 2011 united continental holdings was the first united states airline to fly passengers on a commercial flight using a blend of sustainable advanced biofuels and traditional petroleum-derived jet fuel solazyme developed the algae oil which was refined utilizing honeywells uop process technology into jet fuel to power the commercial flight 53 solazyme produced the worlds first 100 percent algae-derived jet fuel solajet for both commercial and military applications 54 oil prices increased about fivefold from 2003 to 2008 raising fears that world petroleum production is becoming unable to keep up with demand the fact that there are few alternatives to petroleum for aviation fuel adds urgency to the search for alternatives twenty-five airlines were bankrupted or stopped operations in the first six months of 2008 largely due to fuel costs 55 in 2014 astm approved a modification to specification d1655 standard specification for aviation turbine fuels to permit
