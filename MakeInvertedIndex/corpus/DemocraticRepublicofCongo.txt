etymologyedit the democratic republic of the congo was formerly known as in chronological order congo free state belgian congo republic of the congo léopoldville democratic republic of the congo and most recently reverted to its current name from republic of zaire 1 the country was known officially as the democratic republic of the congo from 1965 to 27 october 1971 when it was changed to the republic of zaire 14 in 1992 the sovereign national conference voted to change the name of the country to the democratic republic of the congo but the change was not put into practice 15 the countrys name was restored by former president laurent-désiré kabila following the fall of longtime dictator mobutu sese seko in 1997 16 historyedit early historyedit the area now known as the dr congo was populated as early as 80,000 years ago as shown by the 1988 discovery of the semliki harpoon at katanda one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish 17 18 some historians think that bantu peoples began settling in the extreme northwest of central africa at the beginning of the 5th century and then gradually started to expand southward their propagation was accelerated by the transition from stone age to iron age techniques the people living in the south and southwest were mostly san bushmen and hunter-gatherer groups whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies the development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized agriculture and animal husbandry this led to the displacement of the hunter-gatherer groups in the east and southeast the 10th century marked the final expansion of the bantu in west-central africa rising populations soon made possible intricate local regional and foreign commercial networks that traded mostly in salt iron and copper congo free state  1877–1908edit belgian exploration and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s it was first led by sir henry morton stanley who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of king leopold ii of belgium the eastern regions of the precolonial congo were heavily disrupted by constant slave raiding mainly from arabswahili slave traders such as the infamous tippu tip 19 who was well known to stanley leopold had designs on what was to become the congo as a colony 20 in a succession of negotiations leopold professing humanitarian objectives in his capacity as chairman of the front organization association internationale africaine actually played one european rival against anothercitation needed leopold formally acquired rights to the congo territory at the conference of berlin in 1885 and made the land his private property he named it the congo free state 20 leopolds rėgime began various infrastructure projects such as construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the capital of leopoldville now kinshasa which took eight years to complete nearly all such infrastructure projects were aimed at making it easier to increase the assets which leopold and his associates could extract from the colony 21 in the free state colonists brutalized the local population into producing rubber for which the spread of automobiles and development of rubber tires created a growing international market rubber sales made a fortune for leopold who built several buildings in brussels and ostend to honor himself and his country to enforce the rubber quotas the army the force publique was called in and made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives a matter of policy 22 during the period of 1885–1908 millions of congolese died as a consequence of exploitation and disease in some areas the population declined dramatically it has been estimated that sleeping sickness and smallpox killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower congo river 22 a government commission later concluded that the population of the congo had been reduced by half during this period 21 but determining precisely how many people died is impossible as no accurate records exist belgian congo  1908–60edit in 1908 the belgian parliament despite initial reluctance bowed to international pressure especially from the united kingdom and took over the free state from king leopold iicitation needed on 18 october 1908 the belgian parliament voted in favour of annexing the congo as a belgian colony executive power rested with the belgian minister of colonial affairs assisted by a colonial council conseil colonial both located in brussels and the belgian parliament exercised legislative authority over the belgian congo in 1926 the colonial capital moved from boma to léopoldville some 300km further upstream into the interior the transition from the congo free state to the belgian congo was a break but it was also marked by a large degree of continuity the last governor-general of the congo free state baron wahis remained in office in the belgian congo and the majority of leopold iis administration with him 23 opening up the congo and its natural and mineral riches for the belgian economy remained the main motive for colonial expansion however other priorities such as healthcare and basic education slowly gained in importance colonial administrators ruled the territory and a dual legal system existed a system of european courts and one of indigenous courts tribunaux indigènes indigenous courts had only limited powers and remained under the firm control of the colonial administration in 1936 it was recorded that there were 728 belgian administrators controlling the colonycitation needed no political activity was permitted in the congo whatsoever 24 and the force publique a locally-recruited army under belgian command put down any attempts at rebellion the belgian population of the colony increased from 1,928 in 1910 to nearly 89,000 in 1959 the belgian congo was directly involved in the two world wars during world war i an initial stand-off between the force publique and the german colonial army in german east africa tanganyika turned into open warfare with a joint anglo-belgian invasion of german colonial territory in 1916 and 1917 during the east african campaign the force publique gained a notable victory when it marched into tabora in september 1916 under the command of general charles tombeur after heavy fighting after the war belgium was rewarded for the participation of the force publique in the east african campaign with a league of nations mandate over the previously german colony of ruanda-urundi during world war ii the belgian congo was a crucial source of income for the belgian government in exile in london and the force publique again participated in allied campaigns in africa belgian congolese forces under the command of belgian officers notably fought against the italian colonial army in ethiopia in asosa bortaï and saïo under major-general auguste-eduard gilliaert during the second east african campaign 25 independence and political crisis  1960–65edit in may 1960 a growing nationalist movement the mouvement national congolais or mnc party led by patrice lumumba won the parliamentary elections patrice lumumba thus became the first prime minister of the democratic republic of the congo the parliament elected as president joseph kasavubu of the alliance des bakongo abako party other parties that emerged included the parti solidaire africain or psa led by antoine gizenga and the parti national du peuple or pnp led by albert delvaux and laurent mbariko congo 1960 dossiers du crisp belgium the belgian congo achieved independence on 30 june 1960 under the name république du congo republic of congo or republic of the congo in english shortly after independence the provinces of katanga led by moise tshombe and south kasai engaged in secessionist struggles against the new leadership 26 most of the 100,000 europeans who had remained behind after independence fled the country 27 opening the way for congolese to replace the european military and administrative elite 28 as the neighboring french colony of middle congo moyen congo also chose the name republic of congo upon achieving its independence the two countries were more commonly known as congo-léopoldville and congo-brazzaville after their capital cities on 5 september 1960 kasavubu dismissed lumumba from office lumumba declared kasavubus action unconstitutional and a crisis between the two leaders developed cf sécession au katanga jgerald-libois -brussels- crisp on 14 september lumumba was arrested by forces loyal to joseph mobutu on 17 january 1961 he was handed over to katangan authorities and executed by belgian-led katangese troops 29 amidst widespread confusion and chaos a temporary government was led by technicians collège des commissaires with evariste kimba the katanga secession was ended in january 1963 with the assistance of un forces several short-lived governments of joseph ileo cyrille adoula and moise tshombe took over in quick succession lumumba had previously appointed joseph mobutu chief of staff of the new congo army armée nationale congolaise anccitation needed taking advantage of the leadership crisis between kasavubu and lumumba mobutu garnered enough support within the army to create mutiny with financial support from the united states and belgium mobutu paid his soldiers privately the aversion of western powers to communism and leftist ideology influenced their decision to finance mobutus quest to neutralize kasavubu and lumumba in a coup by proxy a constitutional referendum after mobutus coup of 1965 resulted in the countrys official name being changed to the democratic republic of the congo 1 in 1971 mobutu changed the name again this time to republic of zaire 30 14 zaire  1971–97edit the new president had the support of the united states because of his staunch opposition to communism believing that his administration would serve as an effective counter to communist movements in africa a one-party system was established and mobutu declared himself head of state he periodically held elections in which he was the only candidate although relative peace and stability were achieved mobutus government was guilty of severe human rights violations political repression a cult of personality and corruption corruption became so prevalent the term le mal zairois or zairean sickness 31 meaning gross corruption theft and mismanagement was coined reportedly by mobutu himself 32 international aid most often in the form of loans enriched mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one-quarter of what had existed in 1960 zaire became a kleptocracy as mobutu and his associates embezzled government funds in a campaign to identify himself with african nationalism starting on 1 june 1966 mobutu renamed the nations cities léopoldville became kinshasa the country was now democratic republic of the congokinshasa stanleyville became kisangani elisabethville became lubumbashi and coquilhatville became mbandaka this renaming campaign was completed in the 1970s in 1971 mobutu renamed the country the republic of zaire 14 its fourth name change in 11 years and its sixth overall the congo river was renamed the zaire river during the 1970s and 1980s he was invited to visit the united states on several occasions meeting with us presidents richard nixon ronald reagan and george h w bush 33 following the dissolution of the soviet union us relations with mobutu cooled as he was no longer deemed necessary as a cold war ally opponents within zaire stepped up demands for reform this atmosphere contributed to mobutus declaring the third republic in 1990 whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform the reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic mobutu continued in power until armed forces forced him to flee zaire in 1997 continental and civil wars  1996presentedit by 1996 following the rwandan civil war and genocide and the ascension of a tutsi-led government in rwanda rwandan hutu militia forces interahamwe fled to eastern zaire and used refugee camps as a base for incursions against rwanda they allied with the zairian armed forces faz to launch a campaign against congolese ethnic tutsis in eastern zaire 34 a coalition of rwandan and ugandan armies invaded zaire to overthrow the government of mobutu and ultimately to control the mineral resources of zaire launching the first congo war the coalition allied with some opposition figures led by laurent-désiré kabila becoming the alliance of democratic forces for the liberation of congo afdl in 1997 mobutu fled and kabila marched into kinshasa naming himself president and reverting the name of the country to the democratic republic of the congo kabila later requested that foreign military forces return to their own countrieshe had concerns that the rwandan officers running his army were plotting a coup to give the presidency to a tutsi who would report directly to the rwandan president paul kagame rwandan troops retreated to goma and launched a new tutsi-led rebel military movement called the rassemblement congolais pour la democratie rcd to fight against kabila while uganda instigated the creation of new rebel movement called the movement for the liberation of congo mlc led by the congolese warlord jean-pierre bemba the two rebel movements along with rwandan and ugandan troops started the second congo war by attacking the drc army in 1998 angolan zimbabwean and namibian militaries entered the hostilities on the side of the government kabila was assassinated in 2001 his son joseph kabila succeeded him and called for multilateral peace-talks un peacekeepers monuc now known as monusco arrived in april 2001 in 2002 and 2003 bemba intervened in the central african republic on behalf of its former president ange-félix patassé 35 talks led to the signing of a peace accord in which kabila would share power with former rebels by june 2003 all foreign armies except those of rwanda had pulled out of congo a transitional government was set up until the election was over a constitution was approved by voters and on 30 july 2006 drc held its first multi-party elections an election-result dispute between kabila and jean-pierre bemba turned into an all-out battle between their supporters in the streets of kinshasa monuc took control of the city a new election took place in october 2006 which kabila won and on december 2006 he was sworn in as president however laurent nkunda a member of an rcd branch integrated to the army rcd-goma defected along with troops loyal to him and formed the national congress for the defence of the people cndp which began an armed rebellion against the government starting the kivu conflict they were believedby whom to be again backed by rwanda as a way to tackle the hutu group democratic forces for the liberation of rwanda fdlr in march 2009 after a deal between the drc and rwanda rwandan troops entered the drc and arrested nkunda and were allowed to pursue fdlr militants the cndp signed a peace treaty with the government in which it agreed to become a political party and to have its soldiers integrated into the national army in exchange for the release of its imprisoned members 36 in 2012 the leader of the cndp bosco ntaganda and troops loyal to him mutinied and formed the rebel military march 23 movement claiming a violation of the treaty by the government 37 in the resulting m23 rebellion m23 briefly captured the provincial capital of goma in november 2012 38 39 neighboring countries particularly rwanda have been accused of using rebels groups as proxies to gain control of the resource-rich country and of arming rebels a claim they deny 40 41 in march 2013 the united nations security council authorized the united nations force intervention brigade the first offensive united nations peacekeeping unit to neutralize armed groups 42 on 5 november 2013 m23 declared an end to its insurgency 43 additionally in northern katanga the

who claimed to represent the lendu and hema ethnic groups respectively in the northeast joseph konys lra moved from their original bases in uganda and south sudan to dr congo in 2005 and set up camps in the garamba national park 45 46 in 2009 people in the congo continued to die at a rate of an estimated 45,000 per month 47 estimates of the number who have died from the long conflict range from 900,000 to 5,400,000 48 the death toll is due to widespread disease and famine reports indicate that almost half of the individuals who have died are children under five years of age 49 there have been frequent reports of weapon bearers killing civilians of the destruction of property of widespread sexual violence 50 causing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes and of other breaches of humanitarian and human rights law one study found that more than 400,000 women are raped in the democratic republic of congo every year 51 in 2015 major protests broke out across the country and protesters demanded that joseph kabila step down as president the protests began after the passage of a law by the congolese lower house that if also passed by the congolese upper house would keep kabila in power at least until a national census was conducted a process which would likely take several years and therefore keep him in power past the planned 2016 elections which he is constitutionally barred from participating in this bill passed however it was gutted of the provision that would keep joseph kabila in power until a census took place a census is supposed to take place but it is no longer tied to when the elections take place as of 2015update elections are scheduled for late 2016 and a tenuous peace holds over the congo geographyedit the democratic republic of the congo drc is located in central sub-saharan africa bounded by clockwise from the southwest angola the south atlantic ocean the republic of congo the central african republic south sudan uganda rwanda burundi tanzania across lake tanganyika and zambia the country lies between latitudes 6n and 14s and longitudes 12 and 32e it straddles the equator with one-third to the north and two-thirds to the south the size of congo 2,345,408 square kilometres  905,567sqmi is slightly greater than the combined areas of spain france germany sweden and norway as a result of its equatorial location the drc experiences high precipitation and has the highest frequency of thunderstorms in the world the annual rainfall can total upwards of 2,000 millimetres  80in in some places and the area sustains the congo rainforest the second-largest rain forest in the world after the amazon this massive expanse of lush jungle covers most of the vast low-lying central basin of the river which slopes toward the atlantic ocean in the west this area is surrounded by plateaus merging into savannas in the south and southwest by mountainous terraces in the west and dense grasslands extending beyond the congo river in the north high glaciated mountains rwenzori mountains are found in the extreme eastern regioncitation needed the tropical climate also produced the congo river system which dominates the region topographically along with the rainforest it flows through though they are not mutually exclusive the name for the congo state is derived in part from the river the river basin meaning the congo river and all of its myriad tributaries occupies nearly the entire country and an area of nearly 1,000,000km2  390,000sqmi the river and its tributaries form the backbone of congolese economics and transportation major tributaries include the kasai sangha ubangi ruzizi aruwimi and lulonga the sources of the congo are in the albertine rift mountains that flank the western branch of the east african rift as well as lake tanganyika and lake mweru the river flows generally west from kisangani just below boyoma falls then gradually bends southwest passing by mbandaka joining with the ubangi river and running into the pool malebo stanley pool kinshasa and brazzaville are on opposite sides of the river at the pool see nasa image then the river narrows and falls through a number of cataracts in deep canyons collectively known as the livingstone falls and runs past boma into the atlantic ocean the river also has the second-largest flow and the second-largest watershed of any river in the world trailing the amazon in both respects the river and a 37km wide strip of coastline on its north bank provide the countrys only outlet to the atlanticcitation needed the albertine rift plays a key role in shaping the congos geography not only is the northeastern section of the country much more mountainous but due to the rifts tectonic activity this area also experiences volcanic activity occasionally with loss of life the geologic activity in this area also created the famous african great lakes three of which lie on the congos eastern frontier lake albert known during the mobutu era as lake mobutu sese seko lake kivu unknown until late 1712 lake edward known during the amin era as lake idi amin dada and lake tanganyika lake edward and lake albert are connected by the semliki rivercitation needed the rift valley has exposed an enormous amount of mineral wealth throughout the south and east of the congo making it accessible to mining cobalt copper cadmium industrial and gem-quality diamonds gold silver zinc manganese tin germanium uranium radium bauxite iron ore and coal are all found in plentiful supply especially in the congos southeastern katanga regioncitation needed on 17 january 2002 mount nyiragongo erupted in congo with the lava running out at 64kmh  40mph and 46 m  50 yards wide one of the three streams of extremely fluid lava flowed through the nearby city of goma killing 45 and leaving 120,000 homeless four hundred thousand people were evacuated from the city during the eruption the lava poisoned the water of lake kivu killing fish only two planes left the local airport because of the possibility of the explosion of stored petrol the lava passed the airport but ruined the runway trapping several airplanes six months after the 2002 eruption nearby mount nyamulagira also erupted mount nyamulagira also erupted in 2006 and again in january 2010citation needed world wide fund for nature ecoregions located in the congo include central congolian lowland forests home to the rare bonobo primate the eastern congolian swamp forests along the congo river the northeastern congolian lowland forests with one of the richest concentrations of primates in the world southern congolian forest-savanna mosaic a large section of the central zambezian miombo woodlands the albertine rift montane forests region of high forest runs along the eastern borders of the country world heritage sites located in democratic republic of congo are virunga national park  1979 garamba national park  1980 kahuzi-biega national park  1980 salonga national park  1984 and okapi wildlife reserve  1996 provincesedit the country is currently divided into 26 provinces and the city-province of kinshasa the provinces are subdivided into districts which are divided into territories 1 flora and faunaedit the rainforests of the democratic republic of the congo contain great biodiversity including many rare and endemic species such as the common chimpanzee and the bonobo the african forest elephant the mountain gorilla the okapi and the white rhino five of the countrys national parks are listed as world heritage sites the garumba kahuzi-biega salonga and virunga national parks and the okapi wildlife reserve the democratic republic of the congo is the most biodiverse african country 52 the civil war and resulting poor economic conditions have endangered much of this biodiversity many park wardens were either killed or could not afford to continue their work all five sites are listed by unesco as world heritage in danger conservationists have particularly worried about primates the congo is inhabited by several great ape species the common chimpanzee pan troglodytes the bonobo pan paniscus the eastern gorilla gorilla beringei and possibly the western gorilla gorilla gorilla 53 it is the only country in the world in which bonobos are found in the wild much concern has been raised about great ape extinction because of hunting and habitat destruction the chimpanzee the bonobo and the gorilla each of whose populations once numbered in the millions have now dwindled down to only about 200,000 54 gorillas 100,000 55 chimpanzees and possibly only about 10,000 55 bonobos gorillas chimpanzees and bonobos are all classified as endangered by the world conservation union as well as the okapi which is also native to the area bas-congo landscape an okapi a male western gorilla hippopotamus the african forest elephant an angola colobus monkey bas-congo landscape an okapi a male western gorilla hippopotamus the african forest elephant an angola colobus monkey bushmeatedit over the past century or so the drc has become the center of what has been called the central african bushmeat problem regarded by many as a major environmental and socio-economic crisis bushmeat is another word for the meat of wild animals typically obtained through trapping usually with wire snares or else with shotguns poisoned arrows or arms originally intended for use in the drcs numerous military conflictscitation needed the bushmeat crisis emerged mainly as a result of the poor living conditions of the congolese people and a lack of education about the dangers of eating it a rising population combined with deplorable economic conditions made many congolese dependent on bushmeat either as an income source selling the meat or for food unemployment and urbanization throughout central africa have exacerbated the problem further by turning cities like the urban sprawl of kinshasa into prime markets for commercial bushmeatcitation needed this combination has caused widespread endangerment of local fauna and has forced humans to trudge deeper into the wilderness in search of the desired animal meat this overhunting results in the deaths of more animals and makes resources even more scarce for humans the hunting has also been facilitated by the extensive logging prevalent throughout the congos rainforests from both corporate logging and farmers clearing forest landfor agriculture logging allows hunters much easier access to previously-unreachable jungle terrain while simultaneously eroding away the habitats of animals 56 deforestation is accelerating in central africa 57 politicsedit governmentedit after a four-year interlude between two constitutions with new political institutions established at the various levels of government as well as new administrative divisions for the provinces throughout the country a new constitution came into effect in 2006 and politics in the democratic republic of the congo finally settled into a stable presidential democratic republic the 2003 transitional constitution 58 had established a parliament with a bicameral legislature consisting of a senate and a national assembly the senate had among other things the charge of drafting the new constitution of the country the executive branch was vested in a 60-member cabinet headed by a president and four vice presidents the president was also the commander-in chief of the armed forces the transitional constitution also established a relatively independent judiciary headed by a supreme court with constitutional interpretation powerscitation needed the 2006 constitution also known as the constitution of the third republic came into effect in february 2006 it had concurrent authority however with the transitional constitution until the inauguration of the elected officials who emerged from the july 2006 elections under the new constitution the legislature remained bicameral the executive was concomitantly undertaken by a president and the government led by a prime minister appointed from the party able to secure a majority in the national assembly the government not the president is responsible to the parliament the new constitution also granted new powers to the provincial governments creating provincial parliaments which have oversight of the governor and the head of the provincial government whom they elect the new constitution also saw the disappearance of the supreme court which was divided into three new institutions the constitutional interpretation prerogative of the supreme court is now held by the constitutional court 59 although located in the central african un subregion the nation is also economically and regionally affiliated with southern africa as a member of the southern african development community sadc 60 corruptionedit mobutu sese seko ruled the drc which he renamed zaire from 1965 to 1997 a relative explained how the government illicitly

sectors of society to be normal 68 the 2013–2014 dhs survey pp 299 found that 74.8 of women agreed that a husband is justified in beating his wife in certain circumstances 69 the united nations committee on the elimination of discrimination against women in 2006 expressed concern that in the post-war transition period the promotion of womens human rights and gender equality is not seen as a priority 70 71 the eastern part of the country in particular has been described as the rape capital of the world and the prevalence of sexual violence there described as the worst in the world 72 73 female genital mutilation fgm is also practiced in drc although not on a large scale the prevalence of fgm is estimated at about 5 of women 74 75 fgm is illegal the law imposes a penalty of two to

approach 83 84 foreign relations and militaryedit the global growth in demand for scarce raw materials and the industrial surges in china india russia brazil and other developing countries require that developed countries employ new integrated and responsive strategies for identifying and ensuring on a continual basis an adequate supply of strategic and critical materials required for their security needs highlighting the dr congos importance to united states national security the effort to establish an elite congolese unit is the latest push by the us to professionalize armed forces in this strategically important regioncitation needed there are economic and strategic incentives to bring more security to the congo which is rich in natural resources such as cobalt cobalt is a strategic and critical metal used in many industrial and military applications the largest use of cobalt is in superalloys used to make jet engine parts cobalt is also used in magnetic alloys and in cutting and wear-resistant materials such as cemented carbides the chemical industry consumes significant quantities of cobalt in a variety of applications including catalysts for petroleum and chemical processing drying agents for paints and inks ground coats for porcelain enamels decolourisers for ceramics and glass and pigments for ceramics paints and plastics the country contains 80 of the worlds cobalt reserves 85 economy and infrastructureedit the central bank of the congo is responsible for developing and maintaining the congolese franc which serves as the primary form of

more than 30 of its diamond reserves and a tenth of its copper 91 92 despite such vast mineral wealth the economy of the democratic republic of the congo has declined drastically since the mid-1980s the african country generated up to 70 of its export revenue from minerals in the 1970s and 1980s and was particularly hit when resource prices deteriorated at that time by 2005 90 of the drcs revenues derived from its minerals exenberger and hartmann 2007:10 93 the countrys woes mean that despite its potential its citizens are among the poorest people on earth dr congo consistently has the lowest or nearly the lowest nominal gdp per capita in the world the drc is also one of the twenty lowest-ranked countries on the corruption perception index miningedit the congo is the worlds largest producer of cobalt ore 94 and a major producer of copper and diamonds the latter come from kasai province in the west by far the largest mines in the congo are located in southern katanga province formerly shaba and are highly mechanized with a capacity of several millions of tons per year of copper and cobalt ore and refining capability for metal ore the drc is the second-largest diamond-producing nation in the world 95 and artisanal and small-scale miners account for most of its production at independence in 1960 drc was the second-most industrialized country in africa after south africa it boasted a thriving mining sector and a relatively productive agriculture sector 96 the first and second congo wars began in 1996 these conflicts have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue increased external debt and resulted in deaths of more than five million people from war and associated famine and disease malnutrition affects approximately two thirds of the countrys populationcitation needed foreign businesses have curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict lack of infrastructure and the difficult operating environment the war intensified the impact of such basic problems as an uncertain legal framework corruption inflation and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations conditions improved in late 2002 when a large portion of the invading foreign troops withdrew a number of international monetary fund and world bank missions met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan and president joseph kabila began implementing reforms much economic activity still lies outside the gdp data a united nations human development index report shows that the human development index of dr congo is one of the worst its had in decades through 2011 the democratic republic of the congo had the lowest human development index of the 187 ranked countries it ranked lower than niger despite a higher margin of improvement than the latter country over 2010s numberscitation needed the economy of dr congo the second largest country in africa relies heavily on mining however the smaller-scale economic activity from artisanal mining occurs in the informal sector and is not reflected in gdp data 97 a third of the drcs diamonds are believed to be smuggled out of the country making it difficult to quantify diamond production levels 98 in 2002 tin was discovered in the east of the country but to date has only been mined on a small scale 99 smuggling of conflict minerals such as coltan and cassiterite ores of tantalum and tin respectively helped to fuel the war 100 in the eastern congo in september 2004 state-owned gécamines signed an agreement with global enterprises corporate gec a company formed by the merger of dan gertler international dgi with beny steinmetz global to rehabilitate and operate the kananga and tilwezembe copper mines the deal

and positive industrial performance the missing funds date from 2010 and tax bodies should have paid them into the central bank 106 later in 2013 the extractive industries transparency initiative suspended the countrys candidacy for membership due to insufficient reporting monitoring and independent audits but in july 2013 the country improved its accounting and transparency practices to the point where the eiti gave the country full membership transportationedit ground transport in the democratic republic of congo has always been difficult the terrain and climate of the congo basin

total of 2250km of which only 1226km is in good condition see below to put this in perspective the road distance across the country in any direction is more than 2500km eg matadi to lubumbashi 2700km by road the figure of 2250km converts to 35km of paved road per 1,000,000 of population comparative figures for zambia and botswana are 721km and 3427km respectively 107 three routes in the trans-african highway network pass through dr congo tripoli-cape town highway this route crosses the western extremity of the country on national road no 1 between kinshasa and matadi a distance of 285km on one of the only paved sections in fair condition lagos-mombasa highway the dr congo is the main missing link in this east-west highway and requires a new road to be constructed before it can function beira-lobito highway this east-west highway crosses katanga and requires re-construction over most of its length being an earth track between the angolan border and kolwezi a paved road in very poor condition between kolwezi and lubumbashi and a paved road in fair condition over the short distance to the zambian border wateredit the democratic republic of congo has thousands of

dialects are spoken the linguistic variety is bridged both by widespread use of french and the national intermediary languages kituba tshiluba swahili and lingala migrationedit given the situation in the country and the condition of state structures it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable migration data however evidence suggests that drc continues to be a destination country for immigrants in spite of recent declines in their numbers immigration is very diverse in nature refugees and asylum-seekers products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the great lakes region constitute an important subset of the population additionally the countrys large mine operations attract migrant workers from africa and beyond there is also considerable migration for commercial activities from other african countries and the rest of the world but these movements are not well studied 132 transit migration towards south africa and europe also plays a role immigration to the drc has decreased steadily over the past two decades most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced according to the international organization for migration the number of immigrants in the drc has fallen from just over 1 million in 1960 to 754,000 in 1990 to 480,000 in 2005 to an estimated 445,000 in 2010 official figures are unavailable partly due to the predominance of the informal economy in the drc data are also lacking on irregular immigrants however given neighbouring countries ethnic links to drc nationals irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon 132 figures for congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source from 3 to 6 million this discrepancy is due to a lack of official reliable data emigrants from the drc are above all long-term emigrants the majority of whom live in africa and to a lesser extent in europe 79.7 and 15.3 respectively according to estimated 2000 data new destination countries include south africa and various points en route to europe the drc has produced a considerable number of refugees and asylum-seekers located in the region and beyond these numbers peaked in 2004 when according to unhcr there were more than 460,000 refugees from the drc in 2008 congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total 68 of whom were living in other african countries 132 since 2003 more than 400,000

country 142 traditional religions embody such concepts as monotheism animism vitalism spirit and ancestor worship witchcraft and sorcery and vary widely among ethnic groups the syncretic sects often merge elements of christianity with traditional beliefs and rituals and are not recognized by mainstream churches as part of christianity new variants of ancient beliefs have become widespread led by us-inspired pentecostal churches which have been in the forefront of witchcraft accusations particularly against children and the elderlyclarification needed 143 children accused of witchcraft are

under belgian colonial rule and remains to this day the predominant language in the armed forces since the recent rebellions a good part of the army in the east also uses swahili where it is prevalent when the country was a belgian colony the belgian colonizers instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools making it one of the few african nations to have had literacy in local languages during the european colonial period this trend was reversed after independence when french became the sole language of education at all levels 148 since 1975 the four national languages have been reintroduced in the first two years of primary education with french becoming the sole language of education from the 3rd year onwards but in practice many primary schools in urban areas solely use french from the first year of school onward 148 cultureedit the culture of the democratic republic of the congo reflects the diversity of its hundreds of ethnic groups and their differing ways of life throughout the country from the mouth of the river congo on the coast upriver through the rainforest and savanna in its centre to the more densely populated mountains in the far east since the late 19th century traditional ways of life have undergone changes brought about by colonialism the struggle for independence the stagnation of the mobutu era and most recently the first and second congo wars despite these pressures the customs and cultures of the congo have retained much of their individuality the countrys 60 million inhabitants are mainly rural the 30 who live in
