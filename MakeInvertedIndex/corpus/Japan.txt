timeline v t e prehistory and ancient history a paleolithic culture around 30,000bc constitutes the first known habitation of the japanese archipelago this was followed from around 14,000bc the start of the jōmon period by a mesolithic to neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture who include ancestors of both the contemporary ainu people and yamato people 24 25 characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture 26 decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world around 300 bc the yayoi people began to enter the japanese islands intermingling with the jōmon 27 the yayoi period starting around 500bc saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming 28 a new style of pottery 29 and metallurgy introduced from china and korea 30 japan first appears in written history in the chinese book of han 31 according to the records of the three kingdoms the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the 3rd century was called yamataikoku buddhism was first introduced to japan from baekje korea and was promoted by prince shōtoku but the subsequent development of japanese buddhism was primarily influenced by china 32 despite early resistance buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the asuka period  592–710 33 the nara period  710–784 of the 8th century marked an emergence of the centralized japanese state centered on the imperial court in heijō-kyō modern nara the nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of buddhist-inspired art and architecture 34 the smallpox epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of japans population 35 in 784 emperor kanmu moved the capital from nara to nagaoka-kyō before relocating it to heian-kyō modern kyoto in 794 this marked the beginning of the heian period  794–1185 during which a distinctly indigenous japanese culture emerged noted for its art poetry and prose murasaki shikibus the tale of genji and the lyrics of japans national anthem kimigayo were written during this time 36 buddhism began to spread during the heian era chiefly through two major sects tendai by saichō and shingon by kūkai pure land buddhism jōdo-shū jōdo shinshū became greatly popular in the latter half of the 11th century feudal era japans feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors the samurai in 1185 following the defeat of the taira clan in the genpei war sung in the epic tale of heike samurai minamoto no yoritomo was appointed shogun by emperor go-toba and he established a base of power in kamakura after his death the hōjō clan came to power as regents for the shoguns the zen school of buddhism was introduced from china in the kamakura period  1185–1333 and became popular among the samurai class 37 the kamakura shogunate repelled mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by emperor go-daigo emperor go-daigo was himself defeated by ashikaga takauji in 1336 ashikaga takauji established the shogunate in muromachi kyoto this was the start of the muromachi period  1336–1573 the ashikaga shogunate achieved glory in the age of ashikaga yoshimitsu and the culture based on zen buddhism art of miyabi prospered this evolved to higashiyama culture and prospered until the 16th century on the other hand the succeeding ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords daimyo and a civil war the ōnin war began in 1467 opening the century-long sengoku period warring states 38 during the 16th century traders and jesuit missionaries from portugal reached japan for the first time initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between japan and the west this allowed oda nobunaga to obtain european technology and firearms which he used to conquer many other daimyo his consolidation of power began what was known as the azuchimomoyama period  1573–1603 after he was assassinated in 1582 his successor toyotomi hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions of korea in 1592 and 1597 tokugawa ieyasu served as regent for hideyoshis son and used his position to gain political and military support when open war broke out he defeated rival clans in the battle of sekigahara in 1600 tokugawa ieyasu was appointed shogun by emperor go-yōzei in 1603 and he established the tokugawa shogunate in edo modern tokyo 39 the tokugawa shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyo 40 and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku closed country policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the edo period  1603–1868 41 the study of western sciences known as rangaku continued through contact with the dutch enclave at dejima in nagasaki the edo period also gave rise to kokugaku national studies the study of japan by the japanese 42 modern era on march 31 1854 commodore matthew perry and the black ships of the united states navy forced the opening of japan to the outside world with the convention of kanagawa subsequent similar treaties with western countries in the bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises the resignation of the shogun led to the boshin war and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor the meiji restoration 43 adopting western political judicial and military institutions the cabinet organized the privy council introduced the meiji constitution and assembled the imperial diet the meiji restoration transformed the empire of japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence after victories in the first sino-japanese war  1894–1895 and the russo-japanese war  1904–1905 japan gained control of taiwan korea and the southern half of sakhalin 44 japans population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935 45 world wari enabled japan on the side of the victorious allies to widen its influence and territorial holdings in asia the early 20th century saw a brief period of taishō democracy  1912–1926 but the 1920s saw a fragile democracy buckle under a political shift towards fascism the passing of laws against political dissent and a series of attempted coups the subsequent shōwa period initially saw the power of the military increased and brought about japanese expansionism and militarization along with the totalitarianism and ultranationalism that are a part of fascist ideology in 1931 japan invaded and occupied manchuria and following international condemnation of this occupation japan resigned from the league of nations in 1933 in 1936 japan signed the anti-comintern pact with germany and the 1940 tripartite pact made it one of the axis powers 46 in 1941 following its defeat in the brief sovietjapanese border war japan negotiated the sovietjapanese neutrality pact 47 which lasted until 1945 with the soviet invasion of manchuria 48 the empire of japan invaded other parts of china in 1937 precipitating the second sino-japanese war  1937–1945 the imperial japanese army swiftly captured the capital nanjing and conducted the nanking massacre 49 in 1940 the empire then invaded french indochina after which the united states placed an oil embargo on japan 50 on december 7–8 1941 japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on pearl harbor british forces in malaya singapore and hong kong and declared war on the united states and the british empire bringing the us and the uk into world war ii in the pacific 51 52 after allied victories across the pacific during the next four years which culminated in the soviet invasion of manchuria and the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on august 15 53 the war cost japan its colonies china and the wars other combatants tens of millions of lives and left much of japans industry and infrastructure destroyed the allies led by the us repatriated millions of ethnic japanese from colonies and military camps throughout asia largely eliminating the japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories 54 the allies also convened the international military tribunal for the far east on may 3 1946 to prosecute some japanese leaders for war crimes however the bacteriological research units and members of the imperial family involved in the war were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by the supreme commander for the allied powers despite calls for the trial of both groups 55 in 1947 japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices the allied occupation ended with the treaty of san francisco in 1952 56 and japan was granted membership in the united nations in 1956 japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world until surpassed by china in 2010 this ended in the mid-1990s when japan suffered a major recession in the beginning of the 21st century positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery 57 on march 11 2011 japan suffered the strongest earthquake in its recorded history this triggered the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power 58 geography japan has a total of 6,852 islands extending along the pacific coast of east asia the country including all of the islands it controls lies between latitudes 24 and 46n and longitudes 122 and 146e the main islands from north to south are hokkaido honshu shikoku and kyushu the ryukyu islands which include okinawa are a chain to the south of kyushu together they are often known as the japanese archipelago 59 about 73 percent of japan is forested mountainous and unsuitable for agricultural industrial or residential use 2 60 as a result the habitable zones mainly located in coastal areas have extremely high population densities japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world 61 the islands of japan are located in a volcanic zone on the pacific ring of fire they are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-silurian to the pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the philippine sea plate beneath the continental amurian plate and okinawa plate to the south and subduction of the pacific plate under the okhotsk plate to the north the boso triple junction off the coast of japan is a triple junction where the north american plate the pacific plate and the philippine sea plate meets japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the eurasian continent the subducting plates pulled japan eastward opening the sea of japan around 15 million years ago 62 japan has 108 active volcanoes during the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged including shōwa-shinzan on hokkaido and myōjin-shō off the bayonnaise rocks in the pacific destructive earthquakes often resulting in tsunami occur several times each century 63 the 1923 tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people 64 more recent major quakes are the 1995 great hanshin earthquake and the 2011 tōhoku earthquake a 9.0-magnitude 65 quake which hit japan on march 11 2011 and triggered a large tsunami 58 japan is substantially prone to earthquakes tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the pacific ring of fire 66 it has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 world risk index 67 climate the climate of japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south japans geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones hokkaido sea of japan central highland seto inland sea pacific ocean and ryukyu islands the northernmost zone hokkaido has a humid continental climate with long cold winters and very warm to cool summers precipitation is not heavy but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter 68 in the sea of japan zone on honshus west coast northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall in the summer the region is cooler than the pacific area though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn the central highland has a typical inland humid continental climate with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons as well as large diurnal variation precipitation is light though winters are usually snowy the mountains of the chūgoku and shikoku regions shelter the seto inland sea from seasonal winds bringing mild weather year-round 68 the pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind the ryukyu islands have a subtropical climate with warm winters and hot summers precipitation is very heavy especially during the rainy season 68 the average winter temperature in japan is 5.1c  41.2f and the average summer temperature is 25.2c  77.4f 69 the highest temperature ever measured in japan 40.9c  105.6f was recorded on august 16 2007 70 the main rainy season begins in early may in okinawa and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching hokkaido in late july in most of honshu the rainy season begins before the middle of june and lasts about six weeks in late summer and early autumn typhoons often bring heavy rain 71 biodiversity japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands they range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the ryūkyū and bonin islands to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands to temperate coniferous forests in the cold winter portions of the northern islands 72 japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife including the brown bear the japanese macaque the japanese raccoon dog the large japanese field mouse and the japanese giant salamander 73 a large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven ramsar wetland sites 74 75 four sites have been inscribed on the unesco world heritage list for their outstanding natural value 76 environment in the period of rapid economic growth after world war ii environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations as a result environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s responding to rising concern about the problem the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970 77 the oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of japans lack of natural resources 78 current environmental issues include urban air pollution nox suspended particulate matter and toxics waste management water eutrophication nature conservation climate change chemical management and international co-operation for conservation 79 as of june 2015 more than 40 coal-fired power plants are planned or under construction in japan the ngo climate action network announced japan as the winner of its fossil of the day award for doing the most to block progress on climate action 80 japan ranks 39th in the 2016 environmental performance index which measures a nations commitment to environmental sustainability 81 as a signatory of the kyoto protocol and host of the 1997 conference that created it japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change 82 politics government japan is a constitutional monarchy whereby the power of the emperor is very limited as a ceremonial figurehead he is defined by the constitution as the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people power is held chiefly by the prime minister and other elected members of the diet while sovereignty is vested in the japanese people 83 akihito is the current emperor of japan naruhito crown prince of japan stands as next in line to the chrysanthemum throne japans legislative organ is the national diet seated in chiyoda tokyo the diet is a bicameral body consisting of a house of

yoshihiko noda as the prime minister on december 26 2012 85 and became the countrys sixth prime minister to be sworn in during a span of six years although the prime minister is formally appointed by the emperor the constitution of japan explicitly requires the emperor to appoint whoever is designated by the diet 83 historically influenced by chinese law the japanese legal system developed independently during the edo period through texts such as kujikata osadamegaki 86 however since the late 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of europe notably germany for example in 1896 the japanese government established a civil code based on a draft of the german bürgerliches gesetzbuch with the code remaining in effect with postworld war ii modifications 87 statutory law originates in japans legislature and has the rubber stamp of the emperor the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the diet without specifically giving him the power to oppose legislation 83 japans court system is divided into four basic tiers the supreme court and three levels of lower courts 88 the main body of japanese statutory law is called the six codes 89 administrative divisions japan consists of 47 prefectures each overseen by an elected governor legislature and administrative bureaucracy 90 each prefecture is further divided into cities towns and villages 91 the nation is currently undergoing administrative reorganization by merging many of the cities towns and villages with each other this process will reduce the number of sub-prefecture administrative regions and is expected to cut administrative costs 92 foreign relations japan has diplomatic relations with nearly all independent nations and has been an active member of the un since december 1956 its relations with countries other than those discussed earlier are mainly commercial and economic 93 until the meiji period japan relationship with the rest of the world was defined mostly in terms of an east asian world order traditionally dominated by china japan was part of trade routes that included much of southeast and east asia and this trade resulted in much cultural exchange as well as material exchange in the sixteenth century japan began trading with western countries but soon found it disruptive both because of the connections with christianity and because of the demand it created for precious metals 94 the government therefore officially announced limited foreign trade to foreign countries which is known as sakoku 鎖国 under tokugawa shogunate in 1635 after commodore matthew c perry forced japan to open their nation to western world in july 8 1853 after over 200 years absence 95 japan is a member of the g8 apec and asean

on arms exports so that japan can join multinational projects such as the joint strike fighter 107 the 21st century is witnessing a rapid change in global power balance along with globalization the security environment around japan has become increasingly severe as represented by nuclear and missile development by north korea transnational threats grounded on technological progress including international terrorism and cyber attacks are also increasing their significance 108 japan including its self defense forces has contributed to the maximum extent possible to the efforts to maintain and restore international peace and security such as un peacekeeping operations building on the ongoing efforts as a peaceful state the government of japan has been making various efforts on its security policy which include the establishment of the national security council nsc the adoption of the national security strategy nss and the national defense program guidelines ndpg 108 these

135 136 agriculture and fishery the japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.4 of the total countrys gdp 137 only 12 of japans land is suitable for cultivation 138 139 due to this lack of arable land a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas 140 this results in one of the worlds highest levels of crop yields per unit area with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50 on fewer than 56,000 square kilometres  14,000,000 acres cultivated japans small agricultural sector however is also highly subsidized and protected with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in north america 138 there has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors 141 rice accounts for almost all of japans cereal production 142 japan is the second-largest agricultural product importer in the world 142 rice the most protected crop is subject to tariffs of 777.7 139 143 in 1996 japan ranked fourth in the world in tonnage of fish caught 144 japan captured 4,074,580 metric tons of fish in 2005 down from 4,987,703 tons in 2000 9,558,615 tons

japans total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish 147 offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50 of the nations total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period today japan maintains one of the worlds largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15 of the global catch 148 prompting some claims that japans fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna 149 japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling 150 industry some of the largest enterprises in japan include toyota nintendo ntt docomo canon honda takeda pharmaceutical sony panasonic toshiba sharp nippon steel nippon oil and seven  i holdings co 151 it has some of the worlds largest banks and the tokyo stock exchange known

asia japan gained relatively high scores in almost all aspects especially health and hygiene safety and security cultural resources and business travel 164 domestic tourism remains a vital part of the japanese economy and japanese culture children in many middle schools see the highlight of their years as a visit to tokyo disneyland or perhaps tokyo tower and many high school students often visit okinawa or hokkaido the extensive rail network together with domestic flights sometimes in planes with modifications to favor the relatively short distances involved in intra-japan travel allows efficient and speedy transport in 2015 19,737,409 foreign tourists visited japan 165 neighbouring south korea is japans most important source of foreign tourists in 2010 the 2.4 million arrivals made

network of high-speed divided limited-access toll roads connects major cities and is operated by toll-collecting enterprises new and used cars are inexpensive car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy efficiency however at just 50 percent of all distance traveled car usage is the lowest of all g8 countries 199 since privatisation in 1987 dozens of japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets major companies include seven jr enterprises kintetsu seibu railway and keio corporation some 250 high-speed shinkansen trains connect major cities and japanese trains are known for their safety and punctuality 200 201 proposals for a new maglev route between tokyo and osaka are at an advanced stage 202 there are 175 airports in japan 2 the largest domestic airport haneda airport is asias second-busiest airport 203 the largest international gateways are narita international airport kansai international airport and chūbu centrair international airport 204 nagoya port is the countrys largest and busiest port accounting for 10 percent of japans trade value 205 energy as of 2011update 46.1 of energy in japan was produced from petroleum 21.3 from coal 21.4 from natural gas 4.0 from nuclear power and 3.3 from hydropower nuclear power produced 9.2 percent of japans electricity as of 2011update down from 24.9 percent the previous year 206 however by may 2012 all of the countrys nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster in march 2011 though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some of japans 50 nuclear reactors to service 207 as of november 2014update two reactors at sendai are likely to restart in early 2015 208 japan lacks significant domestic reserves and so has a heavy dependence on imported energy 209 japan has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency 210 water supply and sanitation the government took responsibility for regulating the water and sanitation sector is shared between the ministry of health labor and welfare in charge of water supply for domestic use the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation the ministry of the environment in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation and the ministry of internal affairs and communications in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities 211 access to an improved water source is universal in japan 97 of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities and 3 receive water from their own wells or unregulated small systems mainly in rural areas 212 access to improved sanitation is also universal either through sewers or on-site sanitation all collected waste water is treated at secondary-level treatment plants all effluents discharged to closed or semi-closed water bodies such as tokyo bay osaka bay or lake biwa are further treated to tertiary level this applies to about 15 of waste water the effluent quality is remarkably good at 3–10mgl of bod for secondary-level treatment well below the national effluent standard of 20mgl 213 water supply and sanitation in japan is facing some challenges such as a decreasing population declining investment fiscal constraints ageing facilities an ageing workforce a fragmentation of service provision among thousands of municipal utilities and the vulnerability of parts of the country to droughts that are expected to become more frequent due to climate change demographics population japans population is estimated at around 127 million 2 with 80 of the population living on honshū japanese society is linguistically and culturally homogeneous 214 composed of 98.5 ethnic japanese 2 with small populations of foreign workers 214 zainichi koreans 215 chinese filipinos brazilians mostly of japanese descent 216 peruvians mostly of japanese descent and americans are among the small minority groups in japan 217 in 2003 there were about 134,700 non-latin american western not including more than 33,000 american military personnel and their dependents stationed throughout the country 218 and 345,500 latin american expatriates 274,700 of whom were brazilians said to be primarily japanese descendants or nikkeijin along with their spouses 216 the largest community of westerners 219 the most dominant native ethnic group is the yamato people primary minority groups include the indigenous ainu 220 and ryukyuan peoples as well as social minority groups like the burakumin 221 there are persons of mixed ancestry incorporated among the yamato such as those from ogasawara archipelago 222 in 2014 foreign-born non-naturalized workers made up only 1.5 of the total population 223 japan is widely regarded as ethnically homogeneous and does not compile ethnicity or race statistics for japanese nationals however at least one analysis describes japan as a multiethnic society 224 most japanese continue to see japan as a monocultural society former japanese prime minister and current finance minister tarō asō described japan as being a nation of one race one civilization one language and one culture which drew criticism from representatives of ethnic minorities such as the ainu 225 japan has the second longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world 83.5 years for persons born in the period 2010–2015 17 226 the japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a postworld war ii baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates in 2012 about 24.1 percent of the population was over 65 and the proportion is projected to rise to almost 40 percent by 2050 227 v t e religion religion in japan  228 japan has full religious freedom based on article 20 of its constitution upper estimates suggest that 84–96 percent of the japanese population subscribe to shinto as its indigenous religion  50 to 80 of which considering degrees of syncretism with buddhism shinbutsu-shūgō 229 however these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple rather than the number of true believers other studies have suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion 230 according to edwin reischauer and marius jansen some 70–80 of the japanese do not consider themselves believers in any religion nevertheless the level of participation remains high especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the new year taoism and confucianism from china have also influenced japanese beliefs and customs 231 japanese streets are decorated on tanabata obon and christmas 229 shinto is the largest religion in japan practiced by nearly 80 of the population yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves as shintoists in surveys 232 this is due to the fact that shinto has different meanings in japan most of the japanese attend shinto shrines and beseech kami without belonging to shinto organisations 233 and since there are no formal rituals to become a member of folk shinto shinto membership is often estimated counting those who join organised shinto sects 234 shinto has 100,000 shrines 232 and 78,890 priests in the country 235 buddhism first arrived in japan in the 6th century it was introduced in the year 538 or 552 236 from the kingdom of baekje in korea 236 christianity was first introduced into japan by jesuit missions starting in 1549 237 today fewer than 1 238 239 240 to 2.3 are christiansnote 2 most of them living in the western part of the country where the missionaries activities were greatest during the 16th century nagasaki prefecture has the highest percentage of christians about 5.1 in 1996 241 as of 2007update there are 32,036 christian priests and pastors in japan 242 throughout the latest century some western customs originally related to christianity including western style weddings valentines day and christmas have become popular as secular customs among many japanese 243 islam in japan is mostly represented by small immigrant communities from other parts of asia in 2008 keiko sakurai estimated that 80–90 of the muslims in japan were foreign born migrants primarily from indonesia pakistan bangladesh and iran 244 it has been estimated that the muslim immigrant population amounts to 70,000–100,000 people while the estimated number of japanese muslims ranges from thousands to tens of thousands 245 other minority religions include hinduism sikhism and judaism and since the mid-19th century numerous new religious movements have emerged in japan 246 languages more than 99 percent of the population speaks japanese as their first language 2 japanese is an agglutinative language distinguished by a system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of japanese society with verb forms and particular vocabulary indicating the relative status of speaker and listener japanese writing uses kanji chinese characters and two sets of kana syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji as well as the latin alphabet and arabic numerals 247 besides japanese the ryukyuan languages amami kunigami okinawan miyako yaeyama yonaguni also part of the japonic language family are spoken in the ryukyu islands chain few children learn these languages 248 but in recent years the local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages the okinawan japanese dialect is also spoken in the region the ainu language which has no proven relationship to japanese or any other language is moribund with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in hokkaido 249 public and private schools generally require students to take japanese language classes as well as english language courses 250 251 problems the changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues particularly a potential decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits like the public pension plan 252 a growing number of younger japanese are not marrying or remain childless 253 in 2011 japans population dropped for a fifth year falling by 204,000 people to 126.24 million people this was the greatest decline since at least 1947 when comparable figures were first compiled 254 this decline was made worse by the march 11 earthquake and tsunami which killed nearly 16,000 people with approximately another 2,600 still listed as missing as of 2014update 255 japans population is expected to drop to 95 million by 2050 227 256 demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate over how to cope with this problem 253 immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nations aging population 257 258 japan accepts a steady flow of 15,000 new japanese citizens by naturalization 帰化 per year 259 according to the unhcr in 2012 japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement 260 while the us took in 76,000 261 japan suffers from a high suicide rate 262 263 in 2009 the number of suicides exceeded 30,000 for the twelfth straight year 264 suicide is the leading cause of death for people under 30 265 education primary schools secondary schools and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the meiji restoration 266 since 1947 compulsory education in japan comprises elementary and middle school which together last for nine years from age 6 to age 15 almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school japans education system played a central part in the countrys recovery and rapid economic growth in the decades following the end of world war ii after world war ii the fundamental law of education and the school education law were enacted the latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades six years of elementary school three years of junior high school three years of high school and two or four years of university starting in april 2016 various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program in hopes to mitigate bullying and truancy mext plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide in the coming years 267 in japan having a strong educational background greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money to support oneself highly educated individuals are less affected by unemployment trends as higher levels of educational attainment make an individual more attractive in the workforce the lifetime earnings also increase with each level of education attained furthermore skills needed in the modern 21st century labor market are becoming more knowledge-based and strong aptitude in science and mathematics are more strong predictors of employment prospects in japans highly technological economy 268 japan is one of the top-performing oecd countries in reading literacy maths and sciences with the average student scoring 540 and has one of the worlds highest-educated labor forces among oecd countries 269 the japanese populace is well educated and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the countrys competitive high-tech economy the countrys large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering japans post-war economic growth tertiary-educated adults in japan particularly graduates in sciences and engineering benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the countrys high tech economy 270 spending on education as a proportion of gdp is below the oecd average although expenditure per student is comparatively high in japan total expenditure relative to gdp remains small 271 in 2015 japans public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its gdp below the oecd average of 4.7 272 in 2014 the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent in addition bachelors degrees are held by 59 percent of japanese aged 25–34 the second most in the oecd after south korea 14 as the japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities about 75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university junior college trade school or other higher education institution 273 the two top-ranking universities in japan are the university of tokyo and kyoto university 274 275 the programme for international student assessment coordinated by the oecd currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of japanese 15-year-olds as sixth best in the world 276 health in japan health care is provided by national and local governments payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access with fees set by a government committee people without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments since 1973 all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance 277 patients are free to select

japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible cultural properties and national treasures 279 nineteen sites have been inscribed on the unesco world heritage list fifteen of which are of cultural significance 76 architecture japanese architecture is a great combination between local and other influences it has traditionally been typified by wooden structures elevated slightly off the ground with tiled or thatched roofs sliding doors fusuma were used in place of walls allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions people usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor traditionally chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century since the 19th century however japan has incorporated much of western modern and post-modern architecture into construction and design and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology the introduction of buddhism during the sixth century was a catalyst for large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood influence from the chinese tang and sui dynasties led to the foundation of the first permanent capital in nara its checkerboard street layout used the chinese capital of changan as a template for its design a gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design the introduction of the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy during the meiji restoration of 1868 the history of japanese architecture was radically changed by two important events the first was the kami and buddhas separation act of 1868 which formally separated buddhism from shinto and buddhist temples from shinto shrines breaking an association between the two which had lasted well over a thousand years 280 second it was then that japan underwent a period of intense westernization in order to compete with other developed countries initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style architects returning from study with western architects introduced the international style of modernism into japan however it was not until after the second world war that japanese architects made an impression on the international scene firstly with the work of architects like kenzo tange and then with theoretical movements like metabolism art the shrines of ise have been celebrated as the prototype of japanese architecture 281 largely of wood traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space 282 japanese sculpture largely of wood and japanese painting are among the oldest of the japanese arts with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 bc the history of japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native japanese aesthetics and adaptation of imported ideas 283 the interaction between japanese and european art has been significant for example ukiyo-e prints which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as japonism had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the west most notably on post-impressionism 283 famous ukiyo-e artists include hokusai and hiroshige hokusai coined the term manga japanese comics now known as manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide 284 japanese animation is called anime japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s 285 hirado ware porcelain censers in the form of

instruments such as the koto were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries the accompanied recitative of the noh drama dates from the 14th century and the popular folk music with the guitar-like shamisen from the sixteenth 286 western classical music introduced in the late 19th century now forms an integral part of japanese culture the imperial court ensemble gagaku has influenced the work of some modern western composers 287 notable classical composers from japan include toru takemitsu and rentarō taki popular music in post-war japan has been heavily influenced by american and european trends which has led to the evolution of j-pop or japanese popular music 288 karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity in japan a 1993 survey by the cultural affairs agency found that more japanese had sung karaoke that year than had participated in traditional pursuits such as flower arranging ikebana or tea ceremonies 289 literature the earliest works of japanese literature include the kojiki and nihon shoki chronicles and the manyōshū poetry anthology all from the 8th century and written in chinese characters 290 291 in the early heian period the system of phonograms known as kana hiragana and katakana was developed the tale of the bamboo cutter is considered the oldest japanese narrative 292 an account of heian court life is given in the pillow book by sei shōnagon while the tale of genji by murasaki shikibu is often described as the worlds first novel 293 294 during the edo period the chōnin townspeople overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature the popularity of the works of saikaku for example reveals this change in readership and authorship while bashō revivified the poetic tradition of the kokinshū with his haikai haiku and wrote the poetic travelogue oku no hosomichi 295 the meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as japanese literature integrated western influences natsume sōseki and mori ōgai were the first modern novelists of japan followed by ryūnosuke akutagawa junichirō tanizaki yukio mishima and more recently haruki murakami japan has two nobel prize-winning authorsyasunari kawabata  1968 and kenzaburō ōe  1994 292 philosophy japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign particularly chinese and western and uniquely japanese elements 296 in its literary forms japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago 296 archaeological evidence and early historical accounts suggest that japan was originally an animistic culture which viewed the world as infused with kami 神 or sacred presence as taught by shinto though its not a philosophy as such but has greatly influenced all other philosophies in their japanese interpretations 297 confucianism entered japan from china around the 5th century ad as did buddhism 298 confucian ideals are still evident today in the japanese concept of society and the self and in the organization of the government and the structure of society 298 buddhism has profoundly impacted japanese psychology metaphysics and aesthetics 299 neo-confucianism which became prominent in the sixteenth century during the tokugawa era shaped japanese ideas of virtue and social responsibility and through its emphasis on investigating the principle or configuration of things stimulated the japanese study of the natural world 300 also since the 16th century certain indigenous ideas of loyalty and honour western philosophy has had its major impact in japan only since the middle of the 19th century 296 cuisine
