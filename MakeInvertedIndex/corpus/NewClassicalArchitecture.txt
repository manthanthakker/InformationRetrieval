new classical architecture new classical architecture is a contemporary movement in architecture that continues the practice of classical and traditional architecture the design and construction of buildings in these traditions is continuous throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries even as modernist and other post-classical theories of architecture have been more dominant since new classical architecture is not an architectural style and can appear in various forms contemporary classical buildings might be also although not correctly be described with the terms traditionalism neo-historism or historicismrevivalism or simply neoclassical architecture implying the continuation of a specific historical style 1  contents 1 development 2 philosophy 3 education 4 examples 5 see also 6 references 7 bibliography 8 external links  developmentedit at the beginning of the 20th century historicism and jugendstil were still dominant styles in germany the austrian architect adolf loos criticized his times architecture as too grandiloquent and opulent and longed for a complete abandonment of architectural ornaments in his 1910 essay ornament and crime 2 as early as the first major modernist movements like werkbund and bauhaus gained momentum in germany the desire to continue and develop classical styles sprouted 3 from 1904 until around 1955 the heimatschutz style prospered in germany which focused on vernacular traditions and can be roughly translated to cultural protection style examples of this early new classical style are the hamburg museum the prinzipalmarkt in münster and the market square of freudenstadt after heavy allied bombing of germany in world war ii architects such as adolf abel roderich fick konstanty gutschow werner march paul schmitthenner julius schulte-frohlinde and rudolf wolters assisted in the postwar rebuilding of destroyed german cities using heimatschutz and other traditional design methods in britain architect raymond erith continued to design classical houses into the late 1960s and early 1970s quinlan terry a new classical architect who continues to practice was an employee later a partner and now the successor of the late raymond erith in the late 1970s several young architects in europe began challenging modernist proposals in architecture and planning to broadcast them leon krier and maurice culot founded the archives darchitecture moderne in brussels and began publishing texts and counterprojects to modernist proposals in architecture and planning 4 it received a boost from the sponsorship of charles prince of wales especially with the princes foundation for building community 5 with the demand for professors knowledgeable in the history of architecture several phd programs in schools of architecture arose in order to differentiate themselves from art history phd programs where architectural historians had previously trained in the us mit and cornell were the first created in the mid-1970s followed by columbia berkeley and princeton among the founders of new architectural history programs were bruno zevi at the institute for the history of architecture in venice stanford anderson and henry millon at mit alexander tzonis at the architectural association anthony vidler at princeton manfredo tafuri at the university of venice kenneth frampton at columbia university and werner oechslin and kurt forster at eth zürich 7 the creation of these programs was paralleled by the hiring in the 1970s of professionally trained historians by schools of architecture margaret crawford with a phd from ucla at sci-arc elisabeth grossman phd brown university at rhode island school of design christian otto 8 phd columbia university at cornell university richard chafee phd courtauld institute at roger williams university and howard burns ma kings college at harvard in these years postmodern architecture developed a critique of modernist architectural aesthetics 9 among them were certain influential postmodernist architects such as charles moore robert venturi 10 and michael graves who used classical elements as ironic motifs in order to criticize modernisms sterility a broad spectrum of more than two dozen architects theorists and historians presented other alternatives to modernism 11 among them were several serious new classical architects who saw classicism as a legitimate mode of architectural expression several of whom would later become driehaus prize laureates including some such as thomas beeby and robert am stern who practice both in post modern as well as classical modes some postmodernist firms such as stern and albert righter  tittman fully moved from postmodern design to new interpretations of traditional architecture 9 thomas gordon smith the 1979 rome prize laureate from the american academy in rome was a devotee of charles moore in 1988 smith published classical architecture -
