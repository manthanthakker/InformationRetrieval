renewable energy in denmark country with the worlds highest wind power penetration leader in wind turbine manufacture ambitious re expansion programme target of using 100 re in energy and transport sectors by 2050 denmark is a world leading country in wind energy production and wind turbine production in 2014 denmark produced 57.4 of its net electricity generation from renewable energy sources 1 the danish wind company vestas wind systems as has expanded from its domestic base and by 2015 had a revenue of â‚¬8.423 billion with more than 18,000 employees globally and manufacturing plants in denmark germany india italy romania the united kingdom spain sweden norway australia china and the united states see vestas link above for sources wind power alone produced 42.7 of denmarks electricity production in 2014 and is expected to increase its production by nearly 80 in the years to 2024 denmark has a target of producing 30 of all its energy needs from re energy sources by 2020 a considerable increase from the 17 it attained in 2005 2 by 2014 this figure had already reached 29.2 3 and was the fifth highest amongst the eu-28 countries the country has ambitious renewable energy goals for the future including using renewable energy for 100 of its energy needs in all sectors including transport by 2050 in the heating sector the country has long used and continues to develop district heating dh networks hot water or steam is produced centrally and then distributed through a network of insulated pipes to high population areas houses within a district heating area have heat exchangers installed instead of boilers for their heating and hot water requirements the heat exchanger keeps the two water systems separate and means that heat can be adjusted as with a familiar domestic boiler one simple but important innovation in the district heating network was the development of internally insulated pipes the two pipes taking and receiving the return of water are placed inside a much larger pipe and insulating material is set so as to fill the figure eight shaped void between the two smaller and the large pipe in 2013 district heating supplied over 60 of all households in denmark with heating and hot water 4 the development of district heating technology has led denmark to become a world leader in industrial pump and thermostat designs and its products are used in many industries worldwide cogeneration is also widely used this is a process that extracts the waste heat produced when generating electricity power stations designed to do this are known as combined heat and power chp stations chp stations in denmark are often sized to provide the heat required for the local district heating system thus chp stations produce both electricity for the grid and heat for district heating systems heat can be stored in large industrial hot water tanks for several days allowing electricity and heat supply to be provided time independently from each other by 2013 the use of chp stations had reduced the overall energy consumption in denmark by 11 4 danish electricity generation has become increasingly decentralised with a move away from production in the large central power stations to many smaller locally based and mostly chp stations many of these smaller stations use locally sourced bio energy sources including straw and wood

renewable energy consumption more than quadrupled from 48 pj in 1990 to 203 pj in 2015 whilst renewable energy consumption was rising between 1990 and 2013 gross energy consumption actually fell by 7 6 most of the fall can be attributed to a great increase in combined power and heat generation chp and the growth in wind power this has increased energy conversion efficiency reducing conversion losses by 28 or 7 relative to gross energy consumption 6 put simply smaller and decentralised chp plants use fuels far more efficiently than older centralised power plants and wind power has no fossil fuel to waste thus the growth of these two sources  10 during the period 6 has displaced fossil fuels by more than a one-to-one ratio the use of biofuels in local chp plants has further displaced fossil fuel consumption the figures in the table above show that whilst the reduction in fossil fuel use has been most pronounced in coal use there has also been a significant reduction in oil and natural gas usage since 2000 oil has fared better than the other fuels because it still dominates usage in the transport sector and alternative fuels and transport solutions are not yet widely deployed the danish government has introduced the following targets for national energy policy 7 eliminating coal from power production by 2030 providing all electrical and heating from renewable sources by 2035 providing 100 of denmarks energy requirements in electricity heating and transport from renewable sources by 2050 energy consumption by sectoredit projected total gross final energy consumption by sector in 2020 all eu countries as well as iceland and norway submitted national renewable energy action plans nreaps 8 to outline the steps taken and projected progress by each country between 2010 and 2020 to meet the renewable energy directive each plan contains a detailed breakdown of each countrys current renewable energy usage and plans for future developments according to projections by the danish submission in 2020 the gross final energy consumption in denmark by sector breaks down as follows  almost half of energy consumption  46.6 is used in the heating and cooling sector the heating and cooling sector also known as the thermal sector includes domestic heating and air conditioning industrial processes such as furnaces and any use of heat generally the next largest share is the transport sector at 33.6 followed by the electricity sector at 19.8 total annual energy consumption is projected to be 16,419 ktoe  16.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent by 2020 in order to meet denmarks overall target for 30 use of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption  4,904 ktoes by 2020 it was just 17 in 2005 targets have been set for each sector renewable energy use is expected to be 39.8 in the heating and cooling sector 51.9 in the electricity sector and 10.1 in the transport sector the energy measures above are gross final energy consumption another broader measure primary energy consumption also includes energy used in the extraction of fuels the energy sector and energy lost in transformation the transformation sector ie converting heat to electricity in power plants or fuel energy to heat in heating plants as well as gross final energy consumption for end users in 2013 denmarks total final energy consumption was 607 pj whilst its primary energy consumption was 763 pj 9 most of the approximately 25 difference is accounted for in losses in the transformation sector these losses are likely to be most prevalent in thermal electricity sectors thus the use of renewable electricity will reduce co2 emissions and fuels lost in the energy and transformation sectors as well as those in final consumption denmark is one of the worlds most fuel efficient countries and the difference between the two measures is smaller than many other countries electricity sectoredit production by sourceedit in 2014 wind energy produced 42.7 percent of denmarks net electricity generation the largest share from any source and larger than non renewable generated electricity biofuels wood straw and biogas and the biodegradable part of waste

between 2007 and 2014 from 28.1 to 57.4 total renewable electricity generation grew from 10,392 gwh in 2007 to 17,562 gwh by 2014 a rise of 69 since 2007 most of the growth in re electricity generation continues to be the result of growing wind power generation accounting for +56.9 of total generation growth thermal generation from re fuels added an additional 6.5 solar power has also made an impact as a new power source of an additional 597 gwh  5.7 since 2012 reduction in fossil fuel generated electricityedit renewable energy generation in denmark increased from 10,392 gwh to 17,562 gwh between 2007 and 2014 1 11 12 13 14 fossil fuel generation fell from 26,318 gwh to 12,405 gwh in 2014 1 11 12 13 14 electricity generated from renewables first exceeded electricity from fossil fuels in 2012 and again in 2014 so how does a country which generates the largest share of its electricity needs from wind power cope on calm windless days denmark sees this challenge as an opportunity to develop new solutions and in so doing is transforming its energy sector and upgrading its technological and engineering capability and is now exporting these worldwide one of the ways the country manages is by exporting electricity on days when wind production is very high some days denmark produces more electricity from wind power alone then the entire country requires much of the power is exported and stored in norwegian and swedish hydroelectric systems via the system of pumped storage storing power for future use by pumping reservoir levels up higher on calm days the power can be reimported the country also imports and exports electricity to germany and across the nordic region which moves power to where it is most in demand given production conditions on each day as electricity can be transported thousands of kilometres with only a few percentage point transmission losses the load and variability can be spread across a wider and more stable geographic area these long distance transmission lines are being upgraded across both the nordic region and more widely across europe the country has also developed power plants which can increase their output much more rapidly than traditional ones to respond to fluctuating production from wind sources many of these plants are the many smaller and dispersed chp power plants across the country the production and dispersion of electricity across denmark the nordic region and germany can be viewed in real time on the energinetdk website the site illustrates wind and power production electricity imports and exports and the contribution made by chp plants to both district heating and stabilising electricity production the link to this site is here energinetdk heating and cooling sectoredit sector all sources according to the energy progress reports submitted by eu member states as well as norway and iceland to the european commission by 2014 renewable energy provided 38.4 of the energy consumed in the heating sector 16 re in the heating sector is overwhelmingly provided by biomass including straw wood bio-oil and biodegradable waste producing about 35 of the sectors total consumption the next largest share was provided by heat pumps at around 2.6 of the total solar thermal produced just under a half percentage share whilst geothermal heat produced a trace contribution renewable energy in the heating sector consists of sources consumed independently as well as their contribution to district heating networks in 2008 about 40 of households gross final energy consumption for domestic heating came from district heating and 65 of consumption for the heating of commercial and public sector buildings 17 by 2013 the figure for households using district heating had grown to 60 in 2014 combined heat and power plants produced 68.7 of the heat for district heating networks in denmark as well as 61 of electricity power produced by thermal plants in the same year biomass waste and biogas provided the fuel for 18.3 20.8 and 0.9 of heat produced in chp plants in heat only plants the figurse were 13.1 2 and 0.3 respectively whilst bio oil provided 0.6 of heat 18 solar thermal heat pumps and electric boilers also provided heat only plants with 0.6 and 0.4 of their production the 2009 nreap 19 report identified new and ongoing ways to promote the use of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector and amongst these included the following tax exemption for re heating and cooling producers building regulations and information initiatives were identified to increase energy efficiency across targeted at both the building sector and consumers both public and private regulations governing the energy efficient cooling of buildings under local authority control has been in place since 2008 a scrappage scheme for those using oil fired boilers to run central heating was planned for march 2010 to reduce co2 output and increase the take up of district heating and re installations building regulations were in force to promote energy savings transport sectoredit sector all sources in 2014 renewable energy provided 5.67 of total final energy consumption in the transport sector the largest source was from biodiesel followed some by bioethanol renewable electricity also made a contribution to the sector but this was smaller in 2014 than those from biofuels in 2008 the governments green transport proposal announced that the upward trend in co2 emissions from transport must be halted the political agreement a green transport policy proposed measures to reduce emissions including the strengthening of public transport and encouraging greater utilisation and efficiency of existing vehicles preparations were made for a greener approach to vehicle taxation including tax exemption for electric vehicles up to 2015 the ministry for transport also established the centre for green transport to carry out research into energy efficient transport solutions the edttp act was also cited as having established the energy technology development and demonstration programme to research into solutions including biofuels and intelligent electricity according to the 2009 nreap 19 report biofuels were expected to provide the main source of re in the transport sector rising from 1.3 pj in 2010 to 10.9pj in 2020 renewable electricity was expected to make up the minor share rising from 0.5 pj to 1.2pj over the period for use in electric vehicles and trains total electric vehicle sales in denmark in 2015 were 4,762 units representing 2.29 of total car sales 20 with the tesla model s having a surge of sales at 2,736 units in a rush to beat tax exemptions sourcesedit wind poweredit electricity generated by wind power in denmark rose from 7,170 gwh in 2007 to 13,078 gwh in 2014 offshore wind power has been growing in importance rising from 19.1 of total wind production in 2007 to 34.5 of production by 2014 denmark was the worlds leading windpower country in 2014 by percentage of demand coverage at 39 of danish electricity consumption 21 ambitious plans for future development include increasing production from the 13.1 twh produced in 2014 to 23.3 twh by 2024 which would raise demand coverage to from 39 to 61 over the period 21 offshore and nearshore windpower is expected to grow quicker than land based wind power to reach almost parity with land based production by 2024  49 21 denmark often produces more electricity from windpower than the entire country requires and will export it for sale or for storage in hydroelectric dams in norway and sweden occasionally electricity prices turn negative for producers when there is a glut of electricity production and lack of demand abroad as well one result of this has been the growth of electric boilers being installed in district heating plants 22 when there is an excess of electricity the plants can use cheap electricity to heat the hot water instead of finite bio or fossil fuels as wind production rises the problem of too much electricity being generated will also give rise to new challenges and solutions electric heating and cooling can also be used in the form of more efficient heat pumps to mop up excess electricity supply the electricity sector will in effect expand into the heating and cooling sector to displace current energy sources renewable thermaledit re thermal generation includes electricity generated from biofuels and electricity generated from the fraction of waste that is biodegradable since 2010 re thermalgeneration in denmark has accounted for approximately 4000 gwh per year 1 13 14 biofuels also play an increasingly important part in district heating the proportion of heat generated by biofuels has been rising since the 1980s and by 2013 close to 45 of district heat was produced by renewables 4 a rough calculation of the 60 of households provided with district heat would imply that renewable fuels provide just over a quarter of denmarks heating and hot water needs in that year re generation from waste re generation from waste reduced a little over the period to 792 gwh in 2014 the reduction being due to less availability of waste and the reduced proportion of waste being classified as renewable energy in 2011 overall about 2.6 of national electricity was generated by re generation from waste 23 denmark incinerates close to 3 million tonnes of waste each year to produce electricity and heat most of it is produced domestically with a smaller share imported from abroad there are 28 waste incineration plants in the country the waste powered chp plants may also co burn additional fossil fuels including oil and natural gas but increasingly biomass is used to improve the performance of waste energy production only the carbon neutral biodegradable part of waste is classified as renewable energy generation which was defined as 55 percent of total waste from 2011 in 2009 it was 58.8 percent 23 total waste provided 20 percent of district heating generation and between 4 and 5 percent of electricity generation in the country 24 energy production from waste over the next ten years is expected to remain at similar levels new pre treatments of waste may however be developed biogas biogas generation has been rising steadily from a low base and reached 447 gwh of electricity production in 2014 contributing about 1.5 of denmarks electricity approximately 75 of biogas generating plants are 3 mw or smaller in size which numbered approximately 120 plants in 2015 23 a further 15 larger chp plants account for the remaining approximately 25 of biogas consumption and co-fire biogas mostly with natural gas the largest source of biogas is from manure other sources include water treatment plants and landfill sites many of the smaller plants are located on farms and or other sources of biogas smaller biogas plants tend not to contribute heat to district heating networks denmark intends to increase production and use of biogas from 4pj consumption in 2015 to 17 pj by 2020 with the goal of using 50 of manure in the country 23 most of the new biogas is likely to be injected directly into the gas system and used for industry and transport biomass biomass provides the largest share of renewable energy in denmark when considering the electricity sector heating and cooling sector and transport sector combined the fuel contributed to approximately 8.6 of total electricity generation in denmark generating 2,631 gwh of electricity in 2014 23 total consumption of biomass amounted to 107 pj in 2013 23 there were 39 chp plants using biomass as a fuel in 2014 consuming approximately 2.7 million tonnes to produce heat and power corresponding to 40.94 pj consumption in that year 23 biomass is sometimes co-fired with other fuels including a small percentage that is co-fired with waste around 40 of the biomass used in denmark is imported including the majority of wood pellets electricity generated from biomass increased dramatically in 2010 following in increased share in its use in a number of power plants between 2009 and 2014 production of power increased by around 50 by 2024 biomass is expected to double the percentage of renewable energy share from 15 to 30 of renewable electricity production in denmark 23 total consumption of biomass is expected to rise to 115pj by 2024 a number of power stations are being converted from using coal to using wood pellets as a fuel some smaller chp plants are converting from using natural gas to biomass solar poweredit solar power is a relatively recent arrival in denmark and significant generation first occurred in 2012 with 104 gwh of electricity generation by 2014 this had risen to 597 gwh 1 14 the large increase in solar deployment in 2012 was aided by incentives including tax credits and net settlement for produced power in response to a dramatic rise in solar installations during that year the incentives were revised downwards for 2013 and a smaller rise occurred during that year smaller solar installations predominate with 73 of pv cell capacity being less than 6kw by the end of 2014 24 a sign that incentives have largely benefitted households installed capacity of solar pv is predicted to rise to 1,140 mw by 2024 and provide an estimated 3 of electricity consumption in denmark 24 targets and

overall between 2005 and 2020 renewable energy sources are expected to rise from 16.5 to 30 of total energy use progressedit according to the progress report submitted by denmark to the european commission by 2014 denmark had achieved a 28.45 share of overall renewable energy use across all energy uses this included a 44.48 share in the electricity sector a 38.4 share in the heating and cooling sector and a 5.67 share in the transport sector for 2014 overall denmark is running well ahead of its predicted trajectory and was close to achieving its 2020 as early as 2014 total renewable energy consumption is a little below predicted levels at 177.8 pj but this is more than compensated by a fall in overall energy consumption partly as a result of efficiency gains see alsoedit wind
