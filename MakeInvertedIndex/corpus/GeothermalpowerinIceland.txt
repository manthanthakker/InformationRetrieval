geothermal power in iceland due to the geological location of iceland over a rift in continental plates the high concentration of volcanoes in the area is often an advantage in the generation of geothermal energy the heating and production of electricity 1 during winter pavements near these areas such as reykjavik and akureyri are heated up five major geothermal power plants exist in iceland which produce approximately 26.2  2010 2 of the nations electricity in addition geothermal heating meets the heating and hot water requirements of approximately 87 of all buildings in iceland apart from geothermal energy 73.8 of the nations electricity is generated by hydro power 3 and 0.1 from fossil fuelscitation needed consumption of primary geothermal energy in 2004 was 79.7 petajoules pj approximately 53.4 of the total national consumption of primary energy 149.1 pj the corresponding share for hydro power was 17.2 petroleum was 26.3 and coal was 3 4 plans are underway to turn iceland into a 100 fossil-fuel-free nation in the near future 5 for example icelands abundant geothermal energy has enabled renewable energy initiatives such as carbon recycling internationals carbon dioxide to methanol fuel process 6 the following are the five largest power stations in iceland 7 see alsoedit list of power stations in iceland renewable energy in iceland the geothermal energy exhibition iceland deep drilling project renewable energy by country referencesedit external linksedit iceland energy authority icelandic energy portal more information about svartsengi power-plant more information about nesjavellir power-plant more information about krafla power-plant more information about hellisheidi power-plant photo gallery from islandsmyndiris photo geothermal power station svartsengi photos of geothermal power plants at reykjanes  svartsengi tiroler bi mannvit engineering of iceland res - school for renewable energy science in iceland keilir - atlantic center of excellence icelandic geosurvey v t e geothermal energy geothermal power geothermal heating geothermal gradient armenia australia canada chile china denmark el salvador energy in ethiopia germany iceland indonesia italy japan kenya lebanon lithuania mexico new zealand philippines portugal romania russia turkey thailand united kingdom united states aquaculture desalination geothermal heat pump district heating binary cycle egs heat pump hot dry rock baseload power capacity factor energy storage energy subsidies eroei category portals renewable energy energy sustainable development v t e ethiopia kenya morocco seychelles afghanistan bangladesh bhutan china india kazakhstan nepal pakistan philippines taiwan thailand european union czech republic denmark finland germany greece hungary ireland italy lithuania luxembourg netherlands portugal spain sweden united kingdom albania iceland norway russia canada costa rica honduras mexico united states australia new zealand tuvalu argentina brazil chile colombia
