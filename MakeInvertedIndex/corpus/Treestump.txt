tree stump after a tree has been cut and felled the stump or tree stump is usually a small remaining portion of the trunk with the roots still in the ground stumps may show the age-defining rings of a tree the study of these rings is known as dendrochronology  contents 1 regeneration 2 stump removal 3 stump harvesting 4 see also 5 references 6 external links  regenerationedit stumps and mama humps both those on the ground and stumps of removed branches are sometimes able to regenerate into new trees often a deciduous tree that has been cut will re-sprout in multiple places around the edge of the stump or from the roots 1 depending on whether the tree is being removed permanently or whether the forest is expected to recover this can be either desirable or undesirable stump sprouts can grow very quickly and sometimes become viable trees themselves either for aesthetics or timber due to the existing root structure however the cut portion of the trunk may weaken the sprouts and introduce disease into the newly forming trees the process of deliberately cutting a tree to a stump to regrow is known as coppicing 2 stump removaledit tree stumps can be difficult to remove from the ground they can be dug out shredded with a stump grinder or burnt a common method for stump removal is to use one of the many chemical stump removal products so long as immediate results are not needed these stump removers are mostly made of potassium nitrate kno3 and act by rapidly increasing the decay of the stump after an average of 4â€“6 weeks the stump will be rotten through and easily fragmented in manageable pieces if time is a limiting factor setting fire to the stump is effective because once the potassium nitrate has been absorbed it acts as an effective oxidizer historically an explosive called stumping powder was used to blast stumps into bits stump harvestingedit in plantation forests in parts of europe stumps are sometimes pulled out of the ground using a specially adapted tracked excavator to supply wood fuel for biomass power stations stump harvesting may provide an increasing component of the woody material required by the biomass power sector see alsoedit trees portal living stump stump harvesting referencesedit buckley gp 1992 ecology and management of coppice woodlands springer 336 pagesisbn 0-412-43110-6 isbn 978-0-412-43110-4 schenk hj and rb jackson 2002 the global biogeography of roots ecological monographs 72  3 311-328 external linksedit stump harvesting in sweden regeneration after stump harvesting stumps as a resource in finland stump harvesting and forest decomposers v t e outline index forest areas ministries research institutes colleges journals arbor day agroforestrydehesa analog forestry bamboo forestry close to nature forestry community forestry ecoforestry energy forestry mycoforestry permaforestry plantation forestry social forestry sustainable forestry urban forestry world forestry afforestation arboriculture controlled burn dendrology ecological thinning even-aged management fire ecology forest informatics ipm inventory governance law old-growth pathology protection restoration secondary transition forest certification atfs cfs fsc pefc sfi smartwood woodland carbon code growth and yield modelling horticulturegm trees i-tree reforestationurban silviculture sustainable management tree allometry breeding tree measurement crown girth height volume informatics ipm inventory governance law old-growth pathology protection restoration secondary transition atfs cfs fsc pefc sfi smartwood woodland carbon code allometry breeding crown girth height volume acid rain carbon sequestration clearcutting deforestation ecological services forest dieback forest fragmentation high grading illegal logging invasive species redd shifting cultivation chitemene slash-and-burn slash-and-char svedjebruk timber recycling wildfire wilding chitemene slash-and-burn slash-and-char svedjebruk coppicing forest farming forest gardening logging manufacturing lumber plywood pulp and paper sawmilling products biochar biomass charcoal non-timber palm oil rayon rubber tanbark rail transport tree farmschristmas trees wood engineered fuel mahogany teak woodworking lumber plywood pulp and paper sawmilling biochar biomass charcoal non-timber palm oil rayon rubber tanbark engineered fuel mahogany teak forester arborist bucker choker setter ecologist feller firefighter handcrew hotshot lookout smokejumper river driver truck driver log scaler lumberjackurban ranger resin tapper rubber tapper shingle weaver timber cruiser tree planter wood process engineer handcrew hotshot lookout smokejumper forestry portal wikiproject commons category by continent by country education events history initiatives lists organizations tools equipment by continent by country education events history initiatives lists organizations tools equipment
