synthetic fuel synthetic fuel or synfuel is a liquid fuel or sometimes gaseous fuel obtained from syngas a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in which the syngas was derived from gasification of solid feedstocks such as coal or biomass or by reforming of natural gas common methods for manufacturing synthetic fuels include the fischer tropsch conversion 1 methanol to gasoline conversion 2 or

greenhouse gas emissions 7.2 fuels emissions  classification and principlesedit the term synthetic fuel has several different meanings and it may include different types of fuels more traditional definitions eg definition given by the international energy agency define synthetic fuel as any liquid fuel obtained from coal or natural gas 4 the energy information administration defines synthetic fuels in its annual energy outlook 2006 as fuels produced from coal natural gas or biomass feedstocks through chemical conversion into synthetic crude andor synthetic liquid products 5 a number of synthetic fuels definitions include also fuels produced from biomass and industrial and municipal waste 6 7 8 the definition of synthetic fuel also allows oil sands and oil shale as synthetic fuel sources and in addition to liquid fuels synthesized gaseous fuels are also considered to be synthetic fuels 9 10 in his synthetic fuels handbook petrochemist james g speight included liquid and gaseous fuels as well as clean solid fuels produced by conversion of coal oil shale or tar sands and various forms of biomass although he admits that in the context of substitutes for petroleum-based fuels it has even wider meaning 10 depending on the context methanol ethanol and hydrogen may also be included 11 12 synthetic fuels are produced by the chemical process of conversion 10 conversion methods could be direct conversion into liquid transportation fuels or indirect conversion in which the source substance is converted initially into syngas which then goes through additional conversion process to become liquid fuels 5 basic conversion methods include carbonization and pyrolysis hydrogenation and thermal dissolution 13 historyedit direct conversion of coal to synthetic fuel was originally developed in germany 14 the bergius process was developed by friedrich bergius yielding a patent in 1913 karl goldschmidt invited him to build an industrial plant at his factory the th goldschmidt ag now known as evonik industries in 1914 15 production began in 1919 16citation needed indirect coal conversion where coal is gasified and then converted to synthetic fuels was also developed in germany by franz fischer and hans tropsch in 1923 14 during world war ii germany used synthetic oil manufacturing german kohleverflüssigung to produce substitute ersatz oil products by using the bergius process from coal the fischertropsch process water gas and other methods zeitz used the tth and mth processes 17 18 in 1931 the british department of scientific and industrial research located in greenwich england set up a small facility where hydrogen gas was combined with coal at extremely high pressures to make a synthetic fuel 19 the bergius process plants were nazi germanys primary source of high-grade aviation gasoline synthetic oil synthetic rubber synthetic methanol synthetic ammonia and nitric acid nearly one third of the bergius production was produced by plants in pölitz polish police and leuna with 1/3 more in five other plants ludwigshafen had a much smaller bergius plant 20 which improved gasoline quality by dehydrogenation using the dhd process 18 synthetic fuel grades included tl jet fuel first quality aviation gasoline aviation base gasoline and gasoline - middle oil 18 and producer gas and diesel were synthesized for fuel as well eg converted armored tanks used producer gas 17:4s2 by early 1944 german synthetic fuel production had reached more than 124,000 barrels per day  19,700m3d from 25plants 21verification needed including 10 in the ruhr area 22:239 in 1937 the four central germany lignite coal plants at böhlen leuna magdeburgrothensee and zeitz along with the ruhr area bituminous coal plant at scholvenbuer had produced 4.8 million barrels  760×10 ^3m3 of fuel four new hydrogenation plants german hydrierwerke were subsequently erected at bottrop-welheim which used bituminous coal tar pitch 18 gelsenkirchen nordstern pölitz and at 200,000 tonsyr 18 wesseling 23 nordstern and pölitzstettin used bituminous coal as did the new blechhammer plants 18 heydebreck synthesized food oil which was tested on concentration camp prisoners 24 the geilenberg special staff was using 350,000 mostly foreign forced laborers to reconstruct the bombed synthetic oil plants 22:210,224 and in an emergency decentralization program to build 7underground hydrogenation plants for bombing protection none were completed planners had rejected an earlier such proposal because the war was to be won before the bunkers would be completed 20 in july 1944 the cuckoo project underground synthetic oil plant  800,000 m2 was being carved out of the himmelsburg north of the mittelwerk but the plant was unfinished at the end of wwii 17 indirect fischer-tropsch ft technologies were brought to the us after world war 2 and a 7,000 barrels per day  1,100m3d plant was designed by hri and built in brownsville texas the plant represented the first commercial use of high-temperature fischer tropsch conversion it operated from 1950 to 1955 when it was shut down when the price of oil dropped due to enhanced production and huge discoveries in the middle east 14 in 1949 a demonstration plant for converting coal to gasoline was built and operated by the us bureau of mines in louisiana missouri 25 direct coal conversion plants were also developed in the us after world war ii including a 3 tpd plant in lawrenceville new jersey and a 250-600 tpd plant in catlettsburg kentucky 26 in later decades the republic of south africa established a state oil company including a large synthetic fuel establishment processesedit there are numerous processes that can be used to produce synthetic fuels these broadly fall into three categories indirect direct and biofuel processesdubious  discuss indirect conversionedit indirect conversion has the widest deployment worldwide with global production totaling around 260,000 barrels per day  41,000m3d and many additional projects under active development indirect conversion broadly refers to a process in which biomass coal or natural gas is converted to a mix of hydrogen and carbon monoxide known as syngas either through gasification or steam methane reforming and that syngas is processed into a liquid transportation fuel using one of a number of different conversion techniques depending on the desired end product  the primary technologies that produce synthetic fuel from syngas are fischer-tropsch synthesis and the mobil process also known as methanol to gasoline or mtg there are some technologies under development to produce ethanol from syngas though these have not yet been demonstrated at commercial scale the fischer-tropsch process reacts syngas with typically a cobalt or iron-based catalyst and transforms the gas into liquid products primarily diesel fuel and jet fuel and potentially waxes depending on the ft process employed the process of producing synfuels through indirect conversion is often referred to as coal-to-liquids ctl gas-to-liquids gtl or biomass-to-liquids btl depending on the initial feedstock at least three projects ohio river clean fuels illinois clean fuels and rentech natchez are combining coal and biomass feedstocks creating hybrid-feedstock synthetic fuels known as coal and biomass to liquids cbtl 27 indirect conversion process technologies can also be used to produce hydrogen potentially for use in fuel cell vehicles either as slipstream co-product or as a primary output 28 direct conversionedit direct conversion refers to processes in which coal or biomass feedstocks are converted directly into intermediate or final products without going through the intermediate step of conversion to syngas via gasification direct conversion processes can be broadly broken up into two different methods pyrolysis and carbonization and hydrogenationcitation needed hydrogenation processesedit one of the main methods of direct conversion of coal to liquids by hydrogenation process is the bergius process 29 in this process coal is liquefied by mixing it with hydrogen gas and heating the system hydrogenation dry coal is mixed with heavy oil recycled from the process catalyst is typically added to the mixture the reaction occurs at between 400c  752f to 500c  932f and 20 to 70mpa hydrogen pressure 30 the reaction can be summarized as follows 30 n c   n  1  h 2  c n h 2 n  2 displaystyle nrm cn+1rm h{2rightarrow rm cnrm h{2n+2 after world war i several plants were built in germany these plants were extensively used during world war ii to supply germany with fuel and lubricants 31 the kohleoel process developed in germany by ruhrkohle and veba was used in the demonstration plant with the capacity of 200ton of lignite per day built in bottrop germany this plant operated from 1981 to 1987 in this process coal is mixed with a recycle solvent and iron catalyst after preheating and pressurizing h2 is added the process takes place in tubular reactor at the pressure of 300bar and at the temperature of 470c  880f 32 this process was also explored by sasol in south africa in 1970-1980s japanese companies nippon kokan sumitomo metal industries and mitsubishi heavy industries developed the nedol process in this process coal is mixed with a recycled solvent and a synthetic iron-based catalyst after preheating h2 is added the reaction takes place in tubular reactor at temperature between 430c  810f and 465c  870f at the pressure 150-200bar the produced oil has low quality and requires intensive upgrading 32 h-coal process developed by hydrocarbon research inc in 1963 mixes pulverized coal with recycled liquids hydrogen and catalyst in the ebullated bed reactor advantages of this process are that dissolution and oil upgrading are taking place in the single reactor products have high hc ratio and a fast reaction time while the main disadvantages are high gas yield high hydrogen consumption and limitation of oil usage only as a boiler oil because of impurities 33 the src-i and src-ii solvent refined coal processes were developed by gulf oil and implemented as pilot plants in the united states in the 1960s and 1970s 32 the nuclear utility services corporation developed hydrogenation process which was patented by wilburn c schroeder in 1976 the process involved dried pulverized coal mixed with roughly 1wt molybdenum catalysts 10 hydrogenation occurred by use of high temperature and pressure syngas produced in a separate gasifier the process ultimately yielded a synthetic crude product naphtha a limited amount of c3c4 gas light-medium weight liquids c5-c10 suitable for use as fuels small amounts of nh3 and significant amounts of co2 34 other single-stage hydrogenation processes are the exxon donor solvent process the imhausen high-pressure process and the conoco zinc chloride process 32 there is also a number of two-stage direct liquefaction processes however after the 1980s only the catalytic two-stage liquefaction process modified from the h-coal process the liquid solvent extraction process by british coal and the brown coal liquefaction process of japan have been developed 32 chevron corporation developed a process invented by joel w rosenthal called the chevron coal liquefaction process cclp it is unique due the close-coupling of the non-catalytic dissolver and the catalytic hydroprocessing unit the oil produced had properties that were unique when compared to other coal oils it was lighter and had far fewer heteroatom impurities the process was scaled-up to the 6 ton per day level but not proven commercially pyrolysis and carbonization processesedit there are a number of different carbonization processes the carbonization conversion occurs through pyrolysis or destructive distillation and it produces condensable coal tar oil and water vapor non-condensable synthetic gas and a solid residue-char the condensed coal tar and oil are then further processed by hydrogenation to remove sulfur and nitrogen species after which they are processed into fuels 33 the typical example of carbonization is the karrick process the process was invented by lewis cass karrick in the 1920s the karrick process is a low-temperature carbonization process where coal is heated at 680f  360c to 1,380f  750c in the absence of air these temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar however the produced liquids are mostly a by-product and the main product is semi-coke a solid and smokeless fuel 35 the coed process developed by fmc corporation uses a fluidized bed for processing in combination with increasing temperature through four stages of pyrolysis heat is transferred by hot gases produced by combustion of part of the produced char a modification of this process the cogas process involves the addition of gasification of char 33 the toscoal process an analogue to the tosco ii oil shale retorting process and lurgi-ruhrgas process which is also used for the shale oil extraction uses hot recycled solids for the heat transfer 33 liquid yields of pyrolysis and karrick processes are generally low for practical use for synthetic liquid fuel production 35 furthermore the resulting liquids are of low quality and require further treatment before they can be used as motor fuels in summary there is little possibility that this process will yield economically viable volumes of liquid fuel 35 biofuels processesedit one example of a biofuel-based synthetic fuel process is hydrotreated renewable jet hrj fuel there are a number of variants of these processes under development and the testing and certification process for hrj aviation fuels is beginning 36 37 there are two such process under development by uop one using solid biomass feedstocks and one using bio-oil and fats the process using solid second-generation biomass sources such as switchgrass or woody biomass uses pyrolysis to produce a bio-oil which is then catalytically stabilized and deoxygenated to produce a jet-range fuel the process using natural oils and fats goes through a deoxygenation process followed by hydrocracking and isomerization to produce a renewable synthetic paraffinic kerosene jet fuel 38 oil sand and oil shale processesedit synthetic crude may also be created by upgrading bitumen a tar like substance found in oil sands or synthesizing liquid hydrocarbons from oil shale there are number of processes extracting shale oil synthetic crude oil from oil shale by pyrolysis hydrogenation or thermal dissolution 13 39 commercializationedit worldwide commercial synthetic fuels plant capacity is over 240,000 barrels per day  38,000m3d including indirect conversion fischer tropsch plants in south africa mossgas secunda ctl qatar oryx gtl and malaysia shell bintulu and a mobil process methanol to gasoline plant in new zealand 5 40 the leading company in the commercialization of synthetic fuel is sasol a company based in south africa sasol operates the worlds only commercial fischer tropsch coal-to-liquids facility at secunda with a capacity of 150,000 barrels per day  24,000m3d 41 numerous large projects are under construction in china and qatar some analysts believe that chinese ctl production will exceed that of south africa by 2015 42 and new and existing gtl capacity in qatar should also exceed the july 2009 south african production level some time in 2011 43 economicsedit the economics of synthetic fuel manufacture vary greatly depending the feedstock used the precise process employed site characteristics such as feedstock and transportation costs and the cost of additional equipment required to control emissions the examples described below indicate a wide range of production costs between $20bbl for large-scale gas-to-liquids to as much as $240bbl for small-scale biomass-to-liquids  carbon capture and sequestration 27 in order to be economically viable projects must do much better than just being competitive head-to-head with oil they must also generate a sufficient return on investment to justify the capital investment in the project 27 gtl economicsedit a synthetic fuel manufactured from natural gas gtl without ccs in a large scale plant in the middle east where gas is relatively inexpensive is expected as of 2005 to be competitive with oil down to approximately $20 per barrel 44 recent advances by the oil company shell have seen synthetic fuels start to become profitable the company built a gtl gas-to-liquid plant in qatar inaugurated in 2011 45 it was to be capable of producing 300,000 barrels per day  48,000m3d of synthetic fuels and other products using natural gas as a feedstock ctlcbtlbtl economicsedit according to a december 2007 study a medium scale  30,000 bpd coal-to-liquids plant ctl sited in the us using bituminous coal is expected to be competitive with oil down to roughly $52–56bbl crude-oil equivalent adding carbon capture and sequestration to the project was expected to add an additional $10bbl to the required selling price though this may be offset by revenues from enhanced oil recovery or by tax credits or the eventual sale of carbon credits 46 a recent netl study examined the relative economics of a number of different process configurations for the production of indirect ft fuels using biomass coal and ccs 27 this study determined a price at which the plant would not only be profitable but also make a sufficient return to yield a 20 return on the equity investment required to build the plant this chapter details an analysis which derives the required selling price rsp of the ft diesel fuels produced in order to determine the economic feasibility and relative competitiveness of the different plant options a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine how carbon control regulations such as an emissions trading scheme for transportation fuels would affect the price of both petroleum-derived diesel and ft diesel from the different plants the key findings of these analyses were  1 ctl plants equipped with ccs are competitive at crude oil prices as low as $86 per barrel and have less life cycle ghg emissions than petroleum-derived diesel these plants become more economically competitive as carbon prices increase  2 the incremental cost of adding simple ccs is very low  7 cents per gallon because co2 capture is an inherent part of the ft process this becomes the economically preferred option at carbon prices above $5mtco2eq.27  3 btl systems are hindered by limited biomass availability which affects the maximum plant size thereby limiting potential economies of scale this combined with relatively high biomass costs results in ft diesel prices which are double that of other configurations $6.45 to $6.96gal compared to $2.56 to $2.82gal for ctl and 15wt cbtl systems equipped with ccs the conclusion reached based on these findings was that both the ctl with ccs and the 8wt to 15wt cbtl with ccs configurations may offer the most pragmatic solutions to the nations energy strategy dilemma ghg emission reductions which are significant  5 to 33 below the petroleum baseline at diesel rsps that are only half as much as the btl options $2.56 to $2.82 per gallon compared to $6.45 to $6.96 per gallon for btl these options are economically feasible when crude oil prices are $86 to $95 per barrel  27 these economics can change in the event that plentiful low-cost biomass sources can be found lowing the cost of biomass inputs and improving economies of scale economics for solid feedstock indirect ft process plants are further confused by carbon regulation generally since permitting a ctl plant without ccs will likely be impossible and ctlccs plants have a lower carbon footprint than conventional fuels carbon regulation is expected to be balance-positive for synthetic fuel production but it impacts the economics of different process configurations in different ways the netl study picked a blended cbtl process using 5-15 biomass alongside coal as the most economical in a range of carbon price and probable future regulation scenarios unfortunately because of scale and cost constraints pure btl processes did not score well until very high carbon prices were assumed though again this may improve with better feedstocks and more efficient larger scale projects 27 chinese direct coal liquefaction economicsedit shenhua group recently reported that their direct coal liquefaction process is competitive with oil prices above $60 per barrel 47 previous reports have indicated an anticipated cost of production of less than $30 per barrel based on a direct coal liquefaction process and a coal mining cost of under $10ton 48 in october 2011 actual price of coal in china was as high as $135ton 49 security considerationsedit a central consideration for the development of synthetic fuel is the security factor of securing domestic fuel supply from domestic biomass and coal nations that are rich in biomass and coal can use synthetic fuel to off-set their use of petroleum derived fuels and foreign oil 50 environmental considerationsedit the environmental footprint of a given synthetic fuel varies greatly depending on which process is employed what feedstock is used what pollution controls are employed and what the transportation distance and method are for both feedstock procurement and end-product distribution 27 in many locations project development will not be possible due to permitting restrictions if a process design is chosen that does not meet local requirements for clean air water and increasingly lifecycle carbon emissions 51 52 lifecycle greenhouse gas emissionsedit among different indirect ft synthetic fuels production technologies potential emissions of greenhouse gasses vary greatly coal to liquids ctl without carbon capture and sequestration ccs is expected to result in a significantly higher carbon footprint than conventional petroleum-derived fuels +147 27 on the other hand biomass-to-liquids with ccs could deliver a 358 reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions 27 both of these plants fundamentally use gasification and ft conversion synthetic fuels technology but they deliver wildly divergent environmental footprintscitation needed generally ctl without ccs has a higher greenhouse gas footprint ctl with ccs has a 9-15 reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to that of petroleum derived diesel 27 53 cbtlccs plants that blend biomass alongside coal while sequestering carbon do progressively better the more biomass is added depending on the type of biomass the assumptions about root storage and the transportation logistics at conservatively 40 biomass alongside coal cbtlccs plants achieve a neutral lifecycle greenhouse gas footprint at more than 40 biomass they begin to go lifecycle negative and effectively store carbon in the ground for every gallon of fuels that they produce 27 ultimately btl plants employing ccs could store massive amounts of carbon while producing transportation fuels from sustainably produced biomass feedstocks although there are a number of significant economic hurdles and a few technical hurdles that would have to be overcome to enable the development of such facilities 27 serious consideration must also be given to the type and method of feedstock procurement for either the coal or biomass used in such facilities as reckless development could exacerbate environmental problems caused by mountaintop removal mining land use change fertilizer runoff food vs fuels concerns or many other potential factors or they could not depending entirely on project-specific factors on a plant-by-plant basiscitation needed a study from us department of energy national energy technology laboratory with much more in-depth information of cbtl life-cycle emissions affordable low carbon diesel from domestic coal and biomass 27 hybrid hydrogen-carbon processes have also been proposed recently 54 as another closed-carbon cycle alternative combining clean electricity recycled co h2 and captured co2 with biomass as inputs as a way of reducing the biomass neededcitation needed fuels emissionsedit the fuels produced by the various synthetic fuels process also have a wide range of potential environmental performance though they tend to be very uniform based on the type of synthetic fuels process used ie the tailpipe emissions characteristics of fischer tropsch diesel tend to be the same though their lifecycle greenhouse gas footprint can vary substantially based on which plant produced the fuel depending on feedstock and plant level sequestration considerationscitation needed in particular fischer tropsch diesel and jet fuels deliver dramatic across-the-board reductions in all major criteria pollutants such as sox nox particulate matter and hydrocarbon emissions 55 these fuels because of their high level of purity and lack of contaminants further enable the use of advanced emissions control equipment that has been shown to virtually eliminate hc co and pm emissions from diesel vehicles 56 in testimony before the subcommittee on energy and environment of the us house of representatives the following statement was made by a senior scientist from rentech f-t fuels offer numerous benefits to aviation users the first is an immediate reduction in particulate emissions f-t jet fuel has been shown in laboratory combusters and engines to reduce pm emissions by 96 at idle and 78 under cruise operation validation of the reduction in other turbine engine emissions is still under way concurrent to the pm reductions is an immediate reduction in co2 emissions from f-t fuel f-t fuels inherently reduce co2 emissions because they have higher energy content per carbon content of the fuel and the fuel is less dense than conventional jet fuel allowing aircraft to fly further on the same load of fuel  57 the cleanliness of these ft synthetic fuels is further demonstrated by the fact that they are sufficiently non-toxic and environmentally benign as to be considered biodegradable this owes primarily to the near-absence of sulfur and extremely low level of aromatics present in the fuel 58 using fischer tropsch diesel results in dramatic across the board tailpipe emissions reductions relative to conventional fuels using fischer tropsch jet fuels have been proven to dramatically reduce particulate and other aircraft emissions using fischer tropsch diesel results in dramatic across the board tailpipe emissions reductions relative to conventional fuels using fischer tropsch jet fuels have been proven to dramatically reduce particulate and other aircraft emissions sustainabilityedit one concern commonly raised about the development of synthetic fuels plants is sustainability fundamentally transitioning from oil to coal or natural gas for transportation fuels production is a transition from one inherently depletable geologically limited resource to another one of the positive defining characteristics of synthetic fuels production is the ability to use multiple feedstocks coal gas or biomass to produce the same product from the same plant in the case of hybrid bctl plants some facilities are already planning to use a significant biomass component alongside coal ultimately given the right location with good biomass availability and sufficiently high oil prices synthetic fuels plants can be transitioned from coal or gas over to a 100 biomass feedstock this provides a path forward towards a renewable fuel source and possibly more sustainable even if the plant originally produced fuels solely from coal making the infrastructure forwards-compatible even if the original fossil feedstock runs outcitation needed some synthetic fuels processes can be converted to sustainable production practices more easily than others depending on the process equipment selected this is an important design consideration as these facilities are planned and implemented as additional room must be left in the plant layout to accommodate whatever future plant change requirements in terms of materials handling and gasification might be necessary to accommodate a future change in production profilecitation needed see alsoedit energy portal renewable energy portal ammonia biofuel butanol fuel carbon neutral fuel cracking e-diesel gas to liquids gasification methanol
