material the sofc has a solid oxide or ceramic electrolyte advantages of this class of fuel cells include high efficiency long-term stability fuel flexibility low emissions and relatively low cost the

oxide fuel cells are a class of fuel cells characterized by the use of a solid oxide material as the electrolyte sofcs use a solid oxide electrolyte to conduct negative oxygen ions from the cathode to the anode the electrochemical oxidation of the oxygen ions with hydrogen or carbon monoxide thus occurs on the anode side more recently proton-conducting sofcs pc-sofc are being developed which transport protons instead of oxygen ions through the electrolyte with the advantage of being able to be run at lower temperatures than traditional sofcs they operate at very high temperatures typically between 500 and 1,000c at these temperatures sofcs do not require expensive platinum catalyst material as is currently necessary for lower temperature fuel cells such as pemfcs and are not vulnerable to carbon monoxide catalyst poisoning however vulnerability to sulfur poisoning has been widely observed and the sulfur must be removed before entering the cell through the use of adsorbent beds or other means solid oxide fuel cells have a wide variety of applications from use as auxiliary power units in vehicles to stationary power generation with outputs from 100 w to 2 mw in 2009 australian company ceramic fuel cells successfully achieved an efficiency of an sofc device up to the previously theoretical mark of 60 2 3 the higher operating temperature make sofcs suitable candidates for application with heat engine energy recovery devices or combined heat and power which further increases overall fuel efficiency because of these high temperatures light hydrocarbon fuels such as methane propane and butane can be internally reformed within the anode sofcs can also be fueled by externally reforming heavier hydrocarbons such as gasoline diesel jet fuel jp-8 or biofuels such reformates are mixtures of hydrogen carbon monoxide carbon dioxide steam and methane formed by reacting the hydrocarbon fuels with air or steam in a device upstream of the sofc anode sofc power systems can increase efficiency by using the heat given off by the exothermic electrochemical oxidation within the fuel cell for endothermic steam reforming process additionally solid fuels such as coal and biomass may be gasified to form syngas which is suitable for fueling sofcs in integrated gasification fuel cell power cycles thermal expansion demands a uniform and well-regulated heating process at startup sofc stacks with planar geometry require in the order of an hour to be heated to light-off temperature micro-tubular fuel cell design geometries promise much faster start up times typically in the order of minutes unlike most other types of fuel cells sofcs can have multiple geometries the planar fuel cell design geometry is the typical sandwich type geometry employed by most types of fuel cells where the electrolyte is sandwiched in between the electrodes sofcs can also be made in tubular geometries where either air or fuel is passed through the inside of the tube and the other gas is passed along the outside of the tube the tubular design is advantageous because it is much easier to seal air from the fuel the performance of the planar design is currently better than the performance of the tubular design however because the planar design has a lower resistance comparatively other geometries of sofcs include modified planar fuel cell designs mpc or mpsofc where a wave-like structure replaces the traditional flat configuration of the planar cell such designs are highly promising because they share the advantages of both planar cells low resistance and tubular cells operationedit a solid oxide fuel cell is made up of four layers three of which are ceramics hence the name a single cell consisting of these four layers stacked together is typically only a few millimeters thick hundreds of these cells are then connected in series to form what most people refer to as an sofc stack the ceramics used in sofcs do not become electrically and ionically active until they reach very high temperature and as a consequence the stacks have to run at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1,000c reduction of oxygen into oxygen ions occurs at the cathode these ions can then diffuse through the solid oxide electrolyte to the anode where they can electrochemically oxidize the fuel in this reaction a water byproduct is given off as well as two electrons these electrons then flow through an external circuit where they can do work the cycle then repeats as those electrons enter the cathode material again balance of plantedit most of the downtime of a sofc stems from the mechanical balance of plant the air preheater prereformer afterburner water heat exchanger anode tail gas oxidizer and electrical balance of plant power electronics hydrogen sulfide sensor and fans internal reforming leads to a large decrease in the balance of plant costs in designing a full system 3 anodeedit the ceramic anode layer must be very porous to allow the fuel to flow towards the electrolyte consequently granular matter is often selected for anode fabrication procedures 4 like the cathode it must conduct electrons with ionic conductivity a definite asset the most common material used is a cermet made up of nickel mixed with the ceramic material that is used for the electrolyte in that particular cell typically ysz yttria stabilized zirconia nanomaterial-based catalysts this ysz part helps stop the grain growth of nickel the anode is commonly the thickest and strongest layer in each individual cell because it has the smallest polarization losses and is often the layer that provides the mechanical support electrochemically speaking the anodes job is to use the oxygen ions that diffuse through the electrolyte to oxidize the hydrogen fuel the oxidation reaction between the oxygen ions and the hydrogen produces heat as well as water and electricity if the fuel is a light hydrocarbon for example methane another function of the anode is to act as a catalyst for steam reforming the fuel into hydrogen this provides another operational benefit to the fuel cell stack because the reforming reaction is endothermic which cools the stack internally electrolyteedit the electrolyte is a dense layer of ceramic that conducts oxygen ions its electronic conductivity must be kept as low as possible to prevent losses from leakage currents the high operating temperatures of sofcs allow the kinetics of oxygen ion transport to be sufficient for good performance however as the operating temperature approaches the lower limit for sofcs at around 600 c the electrolyte begins to have large ionic transport resistances and affect the performance popular electrolyte materials include yttria-stabilized zirconia ysz often the 8 form 8ysz scandia stabilized zirconia scsz usually 9molsc2o3  9scsz and gadolinium doped ceria gdc 5 the electrolyte material has crucial influence on the cell performances 6 detrimental reactions between ysz electrolytes and modern cathodes such as lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite lscf have been found and can be prevented by thin <100nm ceria diffusion barriers 7 if the conductivity for oxygen ions in sofc can remain high even at lower temperatures current target in research ~500c material choices for sofc will broaden and many existing problems can potentially be solved certain processing techniques such as thin film deposition 8 can help solve this problem with existing materials by reducing the traveling distance of oxygen ions and electrolyte resistance as resistance is inversely proportional to conductor length producing grain structures that are less resistive such as columnar grain structure controlling the microstructural nano-crystalline fine grains to achieve fine-tuning of electrical properties building composite possessing large interfacial areas as interfaces have been shown to have extraordinary electrical properties cathodeedit the cathode or air electrode is a thin porous layer on the electrolyte where oxygen reduction takes place the overall reaction is written in kröger-vink notation as follows cathode materials must be at a minimum electronically conductive currently lanthanum strontium manganite lsm is the cathode material of choice for commercial use because of its compatibility with doped zirconia electrolytes mechanically it has a similar coefficient of thermal expansion to ysz and thus limits stress buildup because of cte mismatch also lsm has low levels of chemical reactivity with ysz which extends the lifetime of the materials unfortunately lsm is a poor ionic conductor and so the electrochemically active reaction is limited to the triple phase boundary tpb where the electrolyte air and electrode meet lsm works well as a cathode at high temperatures but its performance quickly falls as the operating temperature is lowered below 800c in order to increase the reaction zone beyond the tpb a potential cathode material must be able to conduct both electrons and oxygen ions composite cathodes consisting of lsm ysz have been used to increase this triple phase boundary length mixed ionicelectronic conducting miec ceramics such as perovskite lscf are also being researched for use in intermediate temperature sofcs as they are more active and can make up for the increase in the activation energy of the reaction interconnectedit the interconnect can be either a metallic or ceramic layer that sits between each individual cell its purpose is to connect each cell in series so that the electricity each cell generates can be combined because the interconnect is exposed to both the oxidizing and reducing side of the cell at high temperatures it must be extremely stable for this reason ceramics have been more successful in the long term than metals as interconnect materials however these ceramic interconnect materials are very expensive as compared to metals nickel- and steel-based alloys are becoming more promising as lower temperature  600–800c sofcs are developed the material of choice for an interconnect in contact with y8sz is a metallic 95cr-5fe alloy ceramic-metal composites called cermet are also under consideration as they have demonstrated thermal stability at high temperatures and excellent electrical conductivity polarizationsedit polarizations or overpotentials are losses in voltage due to imperfections in materials microstructure and design of the fuel cell polarizations result from ohmic resistance of oxygen ions conducting through the electrolyte irω electrochemical activation barriers at the anode and cathode and finally concentration polarizations due to inability of gases to diffuse at high rates through the porous anode and cathode shown as ηa for the anode and ηc for cathodecitation needed the cell voltage can be calculated using the following equation where e 0 displaystyle e{0  nernst potential of the reactants r displaystyle r  thévenin equivalent resistance value of the electrically conducting portions of the cell η c a t h o d e displaystyle eta cathode  polarization losses in the cathode η a n o d e displaystyle eta anode  polarization losses in the anode in sofcs it is often important to focus on the ohmic and concentration polarizations since high operating temperatures experience little activation polarization however as the lower limit of sofc operating temperature is approached ~600c these polarizations do become important 9 above mentioned equation is used for determining the sofc voltage in fact for fuel cell voltage in general this approach results in good agreement with particular experimental data for which adequate factors were obtained and poor agreement for other than original experimental working parameters moreover most of the equations used require the addition of numerous factors which are difficult or impossible to determine it makes very difficult any optimizing process of the sofc working parameters as well as design architecture configuration selection because of those circumstances a few other equations were proposed 10 where e s o f c displaystyle esofc  cell voltage e m a x

and sensitivity studies in plant-level modelling of various systems with solid oxide fuel cells 12 with this mathematical description it is possible to account for different properties of the sofc there are many parameters which impact cell working conditions eg electrolyte material electrolyte thickness cell temperature inlet and outlet gas compositions at anode and cathode and electrode porosity just to name some the flow in these systems is often calculated using the navier-stokes equation ohmic polarizationedit ohmic losses in an sofc result from ionic conductivity through the electrolyte this is inherently a materials property of the crystal structure and atoms involved however to maximize the ionic conductivity several methods can be done firstly operating at higher temperatures can significantly decrease these ohmic losses substitutional doping methods to further refine the crystal structure and control defect concentrations can also play a significant role in increasing the conductivity another way to decrease ohmic resistance is to decrease the thickness of the electrolyte layer ionic conductivityedit an ionic specific resistance of the electrolyte as a function of temperature can be described by the following relationship 10 where δ displaystyle delta   electrolyte thickness and σ displaystyle sigma   ionic conductivity the ionic conductivity of the solid oxide is defined as follows 10 where σ 0 displaystyle sigma {0 and e displaystyle e  factors depended on electrolyte materials t displaystyle t  electrolyte temperature and r displaystyle r  ideal gas constant concentration polarizationedit the concentration polarization is the result of practical limitations on mass transport within the cell and represents the voltage loss due to spatial variations in reactant concentration at the chemically active sites this situation can be caused when the reactants are consumed by the electrochemical reaction faster than they can diffuse into the porous electrode and can also be caused by variation in bulk flow composition the latter is due to the fact that the consumption of reacting species in the reactant flows causes a drop in reactant concentration as it travels along the cell which causes a drop in the local potential near the tail end of the cell the concentration polarization occurs in both the anode and cathode the anode can be particularly problematic as the oxidation of the hydrogen produces steam which further dilutes the fuel stream as it travels along the length of the cell this polarization can be mitigated by reducing the reactant utilization fraction or increasing the electrode porosity but these approaches each have significant design trade-offs activation polarizationedit the activation polarization is the result of the kinetics involved with the electrochemical reactions each reaction has a certain activation barrier that must be overcome in order to proceed and this barrier leads to the polarization the activation barrier is the result of many complex electrochemical reaction steps where typically the rate limiting step is responsible for the polarization the polarization equation shown below is found by solving the butlervolmer equation in the high current density regime where the cell typically operates and can be used to estimate the activation polarization where r displaystyle r  gas

faradays constant i displaystyle i  operating current i 0 displaystyle i{0  exchange current density the polarization can be modified by microstructural optimization the triple phase boundary tpb length which is the length where porous ionic and electronically conducting pathways all meet directly relates to the electrochemically active length in the cell the larger the length the more reactions can occur and thus the less the activation polarization optimization of tpb length can be done by processing conditions to affect microstructure or by materials selection to use a mixed ionicelectronic conductor to further increase tpb length targetedit doe target requirements are 40,000 hours of service for stationary fuel cell applications and greater than 5,000 hours for transportation systems fuel cell vehicles at a factory cost of $40kw for a 10kw coal-based system 13 without additional requirements lifetime effects phase stability thermal expansion compatibility element migration conductivity and aging must be addressed the solid state energy conversion alliance 2008 interim target for overall degradation per 1,000 hours is 4.0 14 researchedit research is going now in the direction of lower-temperature sofcs  600c low temperature systems can reduce costs by reducing insolation materials start-up and degradation-related costs with higher operating temperatures the temperature gradient increases the severity of thermal stresses which affects materials cost and life of the system 15 an intermediate temperature system  650-800c would enable the use of cheaper metallic materials with better mechanical properties and thermal conductivity new developments in nano-scale electrolyte structures have been shown to bring down operating temperatures to around 350c which would enable the use of even cheaper steel and elastomericpolymeric components 16 lowering operating temperatures has the added benefit of increased efficiency theoretical fuel cell efficiency increases with decreasing temperature for example the efficiency of a sofc using co as fuel increases from 63 to 81 when decreasing the system temperature from 900c to 350c 16 research is also under way to improve the fuel flexibility of sofcs while stable operation has been achieved on a variety of hydrocarbon fuels these cells typically rely on external fuel processing in the case of natural gas the fuel is either externally or internally reformed and the sulfur compounds are removed these processes add to the cost and complexity of sofc systems work is under way at a number of institutions to improve the stability of anode materials for hydrocarbon oxidation and therefore relax the requirements for fuel processing and decrease sofc balance of plant costs research is also going on in reducing start-up time to be able to implement sofcs in mobile applications 17 this can be partially achieved by lowering operating temperatures which is the case for proton exchange membrane fuel cells pemfcs 18 due to their fuel flexibility they may run on partially reformed diesel and this makes sofcs interesting as auxiliary power units apu in refrigerated trucks specifically delphi automotive systems are developing an sofc that will power auxiliary units in automobiles and tractor-trailers while bmw has recently stopped a similar project a high-temperature sofc will generate all of the needed electricity to allow the engine to be smaller and more efficient the sofc would run on the same gasoline or diesel as the engine and would keep the air conditioning unit and other necessary electrical systems running while the engine shuts off when not needed eg at a stop light or truck stopcitation needed rolls-royce is developing solid-oxide fuel cells produced by screen printing onto inexpensive ceramic materials rolls-royce fuel cell systems ltd is developing an sofc gas turbine hybrid system fueled by natural gas for power generation applications in the order of a megawatt eg futuregencitation needed ceres power ltd has developed a low cost and low temperature  500–600 degrees sofc stack using cerium gadolinium oxide cgo in place of current industry standard ceramic yttria stabilized zirconia ysz which allows the use of stainless steel to support the ceramic 19 solid cell inc has developed a unique low-cost cell architecture that combines properties of planar and tubular designs along with a cr-free cermet interconnect the high temperature electrochemistry center hitec at the university of florida gainesville is focused on studying ionic transport electrocatalytic phenomena and microstructural characterization of ion conducting materials 20 sienergy systems a harvard spin-off company has demonstrated the first macro-scale thin-film solid-oxide fuel cell that can operate at 500 degrees 21 soecedit a solid oxide electrolyser cell soec is a solid oxide fuel cell set in regenerative mode for the electrolysis of water with a solid oxide or ceramic electrolyte to produce oxygen and hydrogen gas 22 itsofcedit sofcs that operate in an intermediate temperature it range meaning between 600 and 800c are named itsofcs because of the high degradation rates and materials costs incurred at temperatures in excess of 900c it is economically more favorable to operate sofcs at lower temperatures the push for high-performance itsofcs is currently the topic of much research and development one area of focus is the cathode material it is thought that the oxygen reduction reaction is responsible for much of the loss in performance so the catalytic activity of the cathode is being studied and enhanced through various techniques including catalyst impregnation lt-sofcedit low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells lt-sofcs operating lower than 650c are of great interest for future research because the high operating temperature is currently what restricts the development and deployment of sofcs a low-temperature sofc is more reliable due to smaller thermal mismatch and easier sealing additionally a lower temperature requires less insulation and therefore has a lower cost cost is further lowered due to wider material choices for interconnects and compressive nonglassceramic seals perhaps most importantly at a lower temperature sofcs can be started more rapidly and with less energy which lends itself to uses in portable and transportable applications interestingly as temperature decreases the maximum theoretical fuel cell efficiency increases in contrast to the carnot cycle for example the maximum theoretical efficiency of an sofc using co as a fuel increases from 63 at 900c to 81 at 350c 23 this is a materials issue particularly for the electrolyte in the sofc ysz is the most commonly used electrolyte because of its superior stability despite not having the highest conductivity currently the thickness of ysz electrolytes is a minimum of ~10 μm due to deposition methods and this requires a temperature above 700c therefore low-temperature sofcs are only possible with higher conductivity electrolytes various alternatives that could be successful at low temperature include gallium-doped ceria gdc and erbia-cation-stabilized bismuth erb they have superior ionic conductivity at lower temperatures but this comes at the expense of lower thermodynamic stability ceo2 electrolytes become electronically conductive and bi2o3 electrolytes decompose to metallic bi under the reducing fuel environment 24 to combat this researchers created a functionally graded ceriabismuth-oxide bilayered electrolyte where the gdc layer on the anode side protects the esb layer from decomposing while the esb on the cathode side blocks the leakage current through the gdc layer this leads to near-theoretical open-circuit potential opc with two highly conductive electrolytes that by themselves would not have been sufficiently stable for the application this bilayer proved to be stable for 1400 hours of testing at 500c and showed no indication of interfacial phase formation or thermal mismatch while this makes strides towards lowering the operating temperature of sofcs it also opens doors for future research to try and understand this mechanism 25 researchers at the georgia institute of technology dealt with the instability of baceo3 differently they replaced a desired fraction of ce in baceo3 with zr to form a solid solution that exhibits proton conductivity but also chemical and thermal stability over the range of conditions relevant to fuel cell operation a new specific composition bazr0.1ce0.7y0.2o3-δ bzcy7 that displays the highest ionic conductivity of all known electrolyte materials for sofc applications this electrolyte was fabricated by dry-pressing powders which allowed for the production of crack free films thinner than 15 μm the implementation of this simple and cost-effective fabrication method may enable significant cost reductions in sofc fabrication 26 however this electrolyte operates at higher temperatures than the bilayered electrolyte model closer to 600c rather than 500c currently given the state of the field for lt-sofcs progress in the electrolyte would reap the most benefits but research into potential anode and cathode materials would also lead to useful results and has started to be discussed more frequently in literature sofc-gtedit an sofc-gt system is one which comprises a solid oxide fuel cell combined with a gas turbine such systems have been evaluated by siemens westinghouse and rolls-royce as a means to achieve higher operating efficiencies by running the sofc under pressure sofc-gt systems typically include anodic andor cathodic atmosphere recirculation thus increasing efficiency theoretically the combination of the sofc and gas turbine can give result in high overall electrical and thermal efficiency 27 further combination of the sofc-gt in a combined cooling heat and power or trigeneration configuration via hvac also has the potential to yield even higher thermal efficiencies in some cases 28 moreover another interesting feature of the introduced hybrid system is on the gain of 100 co2 capturing at comparable high energy efficiency these features like zero co2 emission and high energy efficiency make the power plant performance noteworthy 29 dcfcedit for the direct use of solid coal fuel without additional gasification and reforming processes a direct carbon fuel cell dcfc has been developed as a promising novel concept of a high-temperature energy conversion system the underlying progress in the development of a coal-based dcfc has been categorized mainly according to the electrolyte materials used such as solid oxide molten carbonate and molten hydroxide as well as hybrid systems consisting of solid oxide and molten carbonate binary electrolyte or of liquid anode fe ag in sn sb pb bi and its alloying and its metalmetal oxide solid oxide electrolyte 30 sofc operated on landfill gas every household produces wastegarbage on a daily basis in 2009 americans produced about 243 million tons of municipal solid waste which is 4.3 pounds of waste per person per day all that waste is sent to landfill sites landfill gas which is produced from the decomposition of waste that gets accumulated at the landfills has the potential to be a valuable source of energy since methane is a major constituent currently the majority of the landfills either burn away their gas in flares or combust it in mechanical engines to produce electricity the issue with mechanical engines is that incomplete combustion of gasses can lead to pollution of the atmosphere and is also highly inefficient the issue with using landfill gas to fuel an sofc system is that landfill gas contains hydrogen sulfide any landfill accepting biological waste will contain about 50-60 ppm of hydrogen sulfide and around 1-2 ppm mercaptans however construction materials containing reducible sulfur species principally sulfates found in gypsum-based wallboard can cause considerably higher levels of sulfides in the hundreds of ppm at operating temperatures of 750 c hydrogen sulfide concentrations of around 0.05 ppm begin to affect the performance of the sofcs ni  h2s  nis  h2 the above reaction controls the effect of sulfur on the anode this can be prevented by having background hydrogen which is calculated below at 453 k the equilibrium constant is 7.39 x 10−5 δg calculated at 453 k was 35.833 kjmol using the standard heat of formation and entropy δg at room temperature  298 k came out to be 45.904 kjmol on extrapolation to 1023 k δg is -1.229 kjmol on substitution keq at 1023 k is 1.44 x 10−4 hence theoretically we need 3.4 hydrogen to prevent the formation of nis at 5 ppm h2s 31 see alsoedit electronics portal energy portal sustainable development portal auxiliary power unit bloom energy server  sofc product from an american
