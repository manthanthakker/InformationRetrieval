gain support for the accord under which its emissions pledge is the lowest by any leading nation 28 29 the copenhagen accord recognises the scientific case for keeping temperature rises below 2c but does not contain commitments for reduced emissions that would be necessary to achieve that aim let alone 1.5c 30 31 one part of the agreement pledges us 30billion to the developing world over the next three years rising to us$100billion per year by 2020 to help poor countries adapt to climate change earlier proposals that would have aimed to limit temperature rises to 1.5c and cut co2 emissions by
