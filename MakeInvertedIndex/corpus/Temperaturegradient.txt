temperature gradient a temperature gradient is a physical quantity that describes in which direction and at what rate the temperature changes the most rapidly around a particular location the temperature gradient is a dimensional quantity expressed in units of degrees on a particular temperature scale per unit length the si unit is kelvin per meter km temperature gradients in the atmosphere are important in the atmospheric sciences meteorology climatology and related fields  contents 1 mathematical description 2 physical processes 2.1 climatology 2.2 meteorology 2.3 weathering 3 indoor temperature 4 see also 5 references 6 external links 2.1 climatology 2.2 meteorology 2.3 weathering  mathematical descriptionedit assuming that the temperature t is an intensive quantity ie a single-valued continuous and differentiable function of three-dimensional space often called a scalar field ie that where x y and z are the coordinates of the location of interest then the temperature gradient is the vector quantity defined as  physical processesedit climatologyedit on a global and annual basis the dynamics of the atmosphere and the oceans can be understood as attempting to reduce the large difference of temperature between the poles and the equator by redistributing warm and cold air and water known as earths heat engine meteorologyedit differences in air temperature between different locations are critical in weather forecasting and climate the absorption of solar light at or near the planetary surface increases the temperature gradient and may result in convection a major process of cloud formation often associated with precipitation meteorological fronts are regions where the horizontal temperature gradient may reach relatively high values as these are boundaries between air masses with rather distinct properties clearly the temperature gradient may change substantially in time as a result of diurnal or seasonal heating and cooling for instance this most likely happens during an inversion for instance during the day the temperature at ground level may be cold while its warmer up in the atmosphere as the day shifts over to night the temperature might drop rapidly while at other places on the land stay warmer or cooler at the same elevation this happens on the west coast of the united states sometimes due to geography weatheringedit expansion and contraction of rock caused by temperature changes during a wildfire through thermal stress weathering may result in thermal shock and subsequent structure failure indoor temperatureedit see alsoedit gradient lapse rate atmospheric temperature for gradient of earths atmosphere referencesedit edward n lorenz  1967 the nature and theory of the general circulation of atmosphere world meteorological organization publication no 218 geneva switzerland 1 m i budyko  1978 climate and life academic press international geophysics series volume 18 isbn 0-12-139450-6 2 robert g fleagle and joost a businger  1980 an introduction to atmospheric physics second edition academic press international geophysics series volume 25 isbn 0-12-260355-9 3 david miller  1981 energy at the surface of the earth an introduction to the energetics of ecosystems academic press international geophysics series volume 29 4 john m wallace and peter v hobbs  2006 atmospheric science an introductory survey second edition academic press international geophysics series isbn 0-12-732951-x 5 external linksedit ipcc third assessment report pictorial representation of temperature gradient tools
