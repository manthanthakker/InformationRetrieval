celsius celsius also known as centigrade 1 2 is a scale and unit of measurement for temperature as an si derived unit it is used by most countries in the world it is named after the swedish astronomer anders celsius  1701–1744 who developed a similar temperature scale the degree celsius c can refer to a specific temperature on the celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty before being renamed to honour anders celsius in 1948 the unit was called centigrade from the latin centum which means 100 and gradus which means steps the scale is based on 0 for the freezing point of water and 100 for the boiling point of water this scale is widely taught in schools today by international agreement the unit degree celsius and the celsius scale are currently defined by two different temperatures absolute zero and the triple point of vsmow specially purified water this definition also precisely relates the celsius scale to the kelvin scale which defines the si base unit of thermodynamic temperature with symbol k absolute zero the lowest temperature possible is defined as being precisely 0k and −273.15c the temperature of the triple point of water is defined as precisely 273.16k and 0.01c 3 this definition fixes the magnitude of both the degree celsius and the kelvin as precisely 1 part in 273.16 approximately 0.00366 of the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water thus it sets the magnitude of one degree celsius and that of one kelvin as exactly the same additionally it establishes the difference between the two scales null points as being precisely 273.15 degrees celsius −273.15 c  0 k and 0 c  273.15 k 4  contents 1 history 1.1 centigrade hectograde and celsius 1.2 common

scale which was the reverse of the scale now known by the name celsius 0 represented the boiling point of water while 100 represented the freezing point of water 5 in his paper observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer he recounted his experiments showing that the melting point of ice is essentially unaffected by pressure he also determined with remarkable precision how the boiling point of water varied as a function of atmospheric pressure he proposed that the zero point of his temperature scale being the boiling point would be calibrated at the mean barometric pressure at mean sea level this pressure is known as one standard atmosphere the bipms 10th general conference on weights and measures cgpm later defined one standard atmosphere to equal precisely 1013250dynes per square centimetre  101.325kpa 6 in 1743 the lyonnais physicist jean-pierre christin permanent secretary of the académie des sciences belles-lettres et arts de lyonfr working independently of celsius developed a scale where zero represented the freezing point of water and 100 represented the boiling point of water 7 8 on 19 may 1743 he published the design of a mercury thermometer the thermometer of lyon built by the craftsman pierre casati that used this scale 9 10 11 in 1744 coincident with the death of anders celsius the swedish botanist carolus linnaeus  1707–1778 reversed celsiuss scale 12 his custom-made linnaeus-thermometer for use in his greenhouses was made by daniel ekström swedens leading maker of scientific instruments at the time and whose workshop was located in the basement of the stockholm observatory as often happened in this age before modern communications numerous physicists scientists and instrument makers are credited with having independently developed this same scale 13 among them were pehr elvius the secretary of the royal swedish academy of sciences which had an instrument workshop and with whom linnaeus had been corresponding daniel ekströmsv the instrument maker and mårten strömer  1707–1770 who had studied astronomy under anders celsius the first known swedish document 14 reporting temperatures in this modern forward celsius scale is the paper hortus upsaliensis dated 16 december 1745 that linnaeus wrote to a student of his samuel nauclér in it linnaeus recounted the temperatures inside the orangery at the botanical garden of uppsala university since the caldarium the hot part of the greenhouse by the angle of the windows merely from the rays of the sun obtains such heat that the thermometer often reaches 30 degrees although the keen gardener usually takes care not to let it rise to more than 20 to 25 degrees and in winter not under 15 degrees centigrade hectograde and celsiusedit since the 19th century the scientific and thermometry communities worldwide referred to this scale as the centigrade scale temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as degrees or when greater specificity was desired as degrees centigrade symbol c because the term centigrade was also the spanish and french language name for a unit of angular measurement  1/100 of a right angle and had a similar connotation in other languages the term centesimal degree known as the gradian grad or gon 1ᵍ  .9 100ᵍ  90 was used when very precise unambiguous language was required by international standards bodies such as the bipm more properly what was defined as centigrade then would now be hectograde furthermore in the context here centigradehectograde is referring to the whole 0-100 range not the given part thereof hence "20 centigrade means "20ᵍ per 100 gradians or 20 hectograde not its literal description .2 gradians to eliminate such confusion the 9th cgpm and the cipm comité international des poids et mesures formally adopted degree celsius in 1948 15a formally keeping the recognized degree symbol rather than adopting the gradiancentesimal degree symbol for scientific use celsius is the term usually used with centigrade otherwise continuing to be in common but decreasing use especially in informal contexts in english-speaking countries 16 it was not until february 1985 that the forecasts issued by the bbc switched from centigrade to celsius 17 common temperaturesedit some key temperatures relating the celsius scale to other temperature scales are shown in the table below name and symbol typesettingedit the degree celsius has been the only si unit whose full unit name contains an uppercase letter since the si base unit for temperature the kelvin became the proper name in 1967 replacing the term degrees kelvin the plural form is degrees celsius 21 the general rule of the international bureau of weights and measures bipm is that the numerical value always precedes the unit and a space is always used to separate the unit from the number eg "30.2 c not "30.2c or "30.2c 22 thus the value of the quantity is the product of the number and the unit the space being regarded as a multiplication sign just as a space between units implies multiplication the only exceptions to this rule are for the unit symbols for degree minute and second for plane angle   and  respectively for which no space is left between the numerical value and the unit symbol 23 other languages and various publishing houses may follow different typographical rules unicode characteredit unicode provides the celsius symbol at codepoint u+2103  degree celsius however this is a compatibility character provided for roundtrip compatibility with legacy encodings the unicode standard explicitly discourages the use of this character in normal use it is better to represent degrees celsius c with a sequence of u+00b0  degree sign  u+0043 c latin capital letter c rather than u+2103  degree celsius for searching treat these two sequences as identical 24 shown below is the degree celsius character followed immediately by the two-component version when viewed on computers that properly support unicode the above line may be similar to the image in the line below enlarged for clarity the canonical decomposition is simply an ordinary degree sign and c so some browsers may simply display c in its place due to unicode normalization temperatures and intervalsedit the degree celsius is a special name for the kelvin for use in expressing celsius temperatures 25 the degree celsius is also subject to the same rules as the kelvin with regard to the use of its unit name and symbol thus besides expressing specific temperatures along its scale eg gallium melts at 29.7646c and the temperature outside is 23 degrees celsius the degree celsius is also suitable for expressing temperature intervals differences between temperatures or their uncertainties eg the output of the heat exchanger is hotter by 40 degrees celsius and our standard uncertainty is ±3c 26 because of this dual usage one must not rely upon the unit name or its symbol to denote that a quantity is a temperature interval it must be unambiguous through context or explicit statement that the quantity is an intervalc this is sometimes solved by using the symbol c pronounced degrees celsius for a temperature and c pronounced celsius degrees for a temperature interval although this usage is non-standard 27 what is often confusing about the celsius measurement is that it follows an interval system but not a ratio system that it follows a relative scale not an absolute scale this is put simply by illustrating that while 10c and 20c have the same interval difference as 20c and 30c the temperature 20c is not twice the air heat energy as 10c as this example shows degrees celsius is a useful interval measurement but does not possess the characteristics of ratio measures like weight or distance 28 coexistence of kelvin and celsius scalesedit in science and in engineering the celsius scale and the kelvin scale are often used in combination in close contexts eg a measured value was 0.01023c with an uncertainty of 70µk this practice is permissible because the magnitude of the degree celsius is equal to that of the kelvin notwithstanding the official endorsement provided by decision #3 of resolution 3 of the 13th cgpm which stated a temperature interval may also be expressed in degrees celsius the practice of simultaneously using both c and k remains widespread throughout the scientific world as the use of si-prefixed forms of the degree celsius such as µc or microdegrees celsius to express a temperature interval has not been well-adopted melting and boiling points of wateredit one effect of defining the celsius scale at the triple point of vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 273.16k and 0.01c and at absolute zero  0k and −273.15c is that neither the melting nor boiling point of water under one standard atmosphere  101.325kpa remains a defining point for the celsius scale in 1948 when the 9th general conference on weights and measures cgpm in resolution 3 first considered using the triple point of water as a defining point the triple point was so close to being 0.01c greater than waters known melting point it was simply defined as precisely 0.01c 29 however current measurements show that the difference between the triple and melting points of vsmow is actually very slightly <0.001c greater than 0.01c thus the actual melting point of ice is very slightly less than a thousandth of a degree below 0c also defining waters triple point at 273.16k precisely defined the magnitude of each 1c increment in terms of the absolute thermodynamic temperature scale referencing absolute zero now decoupled from the actual boiling point of water the value "100c is hotter than 0c  in absolute terms  by a factor of precisely 373.15/273.15 approximately 36.61 thermodynamically hotter when adhering strictly to the two-point definition for calibration the boiling point of vsmow under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339k  99.9839c when calibrated to its-90 a calibration standard comprising many definition points and commonly used for high-precision instrumentation the boiling point of vsmow is slightly less about 99.974c 30 this boiling-point difference of 16.1 millikelvin between the celsius scales original definition and the current one based on absolute zero and the triple point has little practical meaning in common daily applications because waters boiling point is very sensitive to variations in barometric pressure for example an altitude change of only 28cm  11in causes the boiling point to change by one millikelvin see alsoedit comparison of temperature scales degrees of frost its-90 réaumur scale thermodynamic temperature notesedit referencesedit external linksedit
