corporation the london array is a 175 turbine 630mw round 2 offshore wind farm located 20km off the kent coast in the outer thames estuary in the united kingdom it is the largest offshore wind farm in the world and the largest wind farm in europe by megawatt capacity construction of phase 1 of the wind farm began in march 2011 and was completed by mid 2013 being formally inaugurated by the prime minister of the united kingdom david cameron on 4 july 2013 the second phase of the project was refused planning consent in 2014 due to concerns on the impact to sea birds  contents 1 description 2

descriptionedit the wind farm site is more than 20 kilometres  12mi off the north foreland on the kent coast in the area between long sand and kentish knock between margate in kent and clacton in essex 2 the site is mostly away from shipping lanes 3 the first phase consisted of 175 siemens wind power swt-3.6 turbines and two offshore substations giving a wind farm with a peak rated power of 630mw 4 each turbine and offshore substation is erected on a monopile foundation and connected together by 210 kilometres  130mi of 33kv array cables the two offshore substations are connected to an onshore substation at cleve hill near graveney on the north kent coast by four 150kv subsea export cables in total 220 kilometres  140mi 4 it is named after london because the power goes to the london grid 5 the smaller thanet wind farm is to the south of it the array is intended to reduce annual co2 emissions by about 900,000 tons equal to the emissions of 300,000 passenger cars 6 historyedit in 2001 environmental studies identified areas of the outer thames estuary as potential sites for offshore wind farm 7 the department of trade and industry published the paper future offshore -a strategic framework for the offshore wind industry which identified the outer thames estuary as one of three potential areas for future wind farm development round 2 wind farms 8 the crown estate

announced in july 2008 that eon uk and dong energy would buy shells stake 15 subsequently on 16 october 2008 london array announced the abu dhabi based masdar would join eon as a joint venture party in the scheme under the agreement masdar purchased 40 of eons half share of the scheme giving masdar a 20 stake in the project overall 16 17 the resultant ownership was 50 dong energy 30 eon uk

offshore wind farm in the world 22 construction and commissioningedit offshore work began in march 2011 23 the first foundation was installed in march 2011 24 turbines were supplied by siemens wind power 25 their foundations were built by the joint-venture between per aarsleff and bilfinger berger ingenieurbau gmbh the same company supplied and installed the monopiles 26 generators were installed by mpi and a2sea by using an installation vessel tivmpi adventure and a jack-up barge sea worker 27 two offshore substations were designed fabricated and installed by future energy a joint venture between fabricom iemants and geosea while electrical systems and onshore substation work was undertaken by siemens transmission  distribution the subsea export cable was supplied by nexans and array cables by jdr cable systems the array cables and the export cables were installed by vsmc 26 the wind farm started producing electricity at the end of october 2012 23 all 175 turbines of phase 1 were confirmed fully operational on 8 april 2013 28 and the wind farm was formally inaugurated by the prime minister david cameron on 4 july 2013 29 in december 2015 it produced 369 gwh a monthly capacity factor of 78.9 it produced 2.5 twh in 2015 during two days of january 2016 production varied from 3 mw to 619 mw 30 31 phase 2edit a second phase was planned which would have seen a further 166 turbines installed to increase the capacity to 1000mw 32 however the second phase was scaled back and finally cancelled in february 2014 after concerns were raised by the royal society for the protection of birds about its effect on a local population of red-throated divers 32 33 see alsoedit renewable energy portal energy portal kent portal uk portal nautical portal environment portal list
