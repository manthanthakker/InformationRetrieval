thermal mass in building design thermal mass is a property of the mass of a building which enables it to store heat providing inertia against temperature fluctuations it is sometimes known as the thermal flywheel effect 1 for example when outside temperatures are fluctuating throughout the day a large thermal mass within the insulated portion of a house can serve to flatten out the daily temperature fluctuations since the thermal mass will absorb thermal energy when the surroundings are higher in temperature than the mass and give thermal energy back when the surroundings are cooler without reaching thermal equilibrium this is distinct from a materials insulative value which reduces a buildings thermal conductivity allowing it to be heated or cooled relatively separate from the outside or even just retain the occupants thermal energy longer scientifically thermal mass is equivalent to thermal capacitance or heat capacity the ability of a body to store thermal energy it is typically referred to by the symbol cth and measured in units of jc or jk which are equivalent thermal mass may also be used for bodies of water machines or machine parts living things or any other structure or body in engineering or biology in those contexts the term heat capacity is typically used instead  contents 1 background 2 thermal mass in buildings 2.1 properties required for good

energy transferred cth is the thermal mass of the body and δt is the change in temperature for example if 250 j of heat energy is added to a copper gear with a thermal mass of 38.46 jc its temperature will rise by 6.50c if the body consists of a homogeneous material with sufficiently known physical properties the thermal mass is simply the mass of material present times the specific heat capacity of that material for bodies made of many materials the sum of heat capacities for their pure components may be used in the calculation or in some cases as for a whole animal for example the number may simply be measured for the entire body in question directly as an extensive property heat capacity is characteristic of an object its corresponding intensive property is specific heat capacity expressed in terms of a measure of the amount of material such as mass or number of moles which must be multiplied by similar units to give the heat capacity of the entire body of material thus the heat capacity can be equivalently calculated as the product of the mass m of the body and the specific heat capacity c for the material or the product of the number of moles of molecules present n and the molar specific heat capacity c  displaystyle bar c  for discussion of why the thermal energy storage abilities of pure substances vary see factors that affect specific heat capacity for a body of uniform composition c t h displaystyle cth can be approximated by where m displaystyle m is the mass of the body and c p displaystyle cp is the isobaric specific heat capacity of the material averaged over temperature range in question for bodies composed of numerous different materials the thermal masses for the different components can just be added together thermal mass in buildingsedit thermal mass is effective in improving building comfort in any place that experiences these types of daily temperature fluctuationsboth in winter as well as in summer when used well and combined with passive solar design thermal mass can play an important role in major reductions to energy use in active heating and cooling systems the terms heavy-weight and light-weight are often used to describe buildings with different thermal mass strategies and affects the choice of numerical factors used in subsequent calculations to describe their thermal response to heating and cooling in building services engineering the use of dynamic simulation computational modelling software has allowed for the accurate calculation of the environmental performance within buildings with different constructions and for different annual climate data sets this allows the architect or engineer to explore in detail the relationship between heavy-weight and light-weight constructions as well as insulation levels in reducing energy consumption for mechanical heating or cooling systems or even removing the need for such systems altogether properties required for good thermal massedit ideal materials for thermal mass are those materials that have high specific heat capacity high density any solid liquid or gas that has mass will have some thermal mass a common misconception is that only concrete or earth soil has thermal mass even air has thermal mass although very little a table of volumetric heat capacity for building materials is available here but note that their definition of thermal mass is slightly different use of thermal mass in different climatesedit the correct use and application of thermal mass is dependent on the prevailing climate in a district temperate and cold temperate climatesedit solar-exposed thermal massedit thermal mass is ideally placed within the building and situated where it still can be exposed to low-angle winter sunlight via windows but insulated from heat loss in summer the same thermal mass should be obscured from higher-angle summer sunlight in order to prevent overheating of the structure the thermal mass is warmed passively by the sun or additionally by internal heating systems during the day thermal energy stored in the mass is then released back into the interior during the night it is essential that it be used in conjunction with the standard principles of passive solar design any form of thermal mass can be used a concrete slab foundation either left exposed or covered with conductive materials eg tiles is one easy solution another novel method is to place the masonry facade of a timber-framed house on the inside reverse-brick veneer thermal mass in this situation is best applied over a large area rather than in large volumes or thicknesses 7.5–10cm  3-4 is often adequate since the most important source of thermal energy is the sun the ratio of glazing to thermal mass is an important factor to consider various formulas have been devised to determine this 2 as a general rule additional solar-exposed thermal mass needs to be applied in a ratio from 6:1 to 8:1 for any area of sun-facing north-facing in southern hemisphere or south-facing in northern hemisphere glazing above 7 of the total floor area for example a 200 m2 house with 20 m2 of sun-facing glazing has 10 of glazing by total floor area 6 m2 of that glazing will require additional thermal mass therefore using the 6:1 to 8:1 ratio above an additional 36–48 m2 of solar-exposed thermal mass is required the exact requirements vary from climate to climate thermal mass for limiting summertime overheatingedit thermal mass is ideally placed within a building where it is shielded from direct solar gain but exposed to the building occupants it is therefore most commonly associated with solid concrete floor slabs in naturally ventilated or low-energy mechanically ventilated buildings where the concrete soffit is left exposed to the occupied space during the day heat is gained from the sun the occupants of the building and any electrical lighting and equipment causing the air temperatures within the space to increase but this heat is absorbed by the exposed concrete slab above thus limiting the temperature rise within the space to be within acceptable levels for human thermal comfort in addition the lower surface temperature of the concrete slab also absorbs radiant heat directly from the occupants also benefiting their thermal comfort by the end of the day the slab has in turn warmed up and now as external temperatures decrease the heat can be released and the slab cooled down ready for the start of the next day however this regeneration process is only effective if the building ventilation system is operated at night to carry away the heat from the slab in naturally ventilated buildings it is normal to provide automated window openings to facilitate this process automatically hot arid climates eg desertedit this is a classical use of thermal mass examples include adobe or rammed earth houses its function is highly dependent on marked diurnal temperature variations the wall predominantly acts to retard heat transfer from the exterior to the interior during the day the high volumetric heat capacity and thickness prevents thermal energy from reaching the inner surface when temperatures fall at night the walls re-radiate the thermal energy back into the night sky in this application it is important for such walls to be massive to prevent heat transfer into the interior hot humid climates eg sub-tropical and tropicaledit the use of thermal mass is the most challenging in this environment where night temperatures remain elevated its use is primarily as a temporary heat sink however it needs to be strategically located to prevent overheating it should be placed in an area that is not directly exposed to solar gain and also allows adequate ventilation at night to carry away stored energy without increasing internal temperatures any further if to be used at all it should be used in judicious amounts and again not in large thicknesses cold incoming tap water may be piped through radiators to draw summer thermal energy from the air in most areas its initial temperature is 60f  16c degrees since the existing plumbing is deep underground its well insulated from the heat of the day materials commonly used for thermal massedit water water has the highest volumetric heat capacity of all commonly used material typically it is placed in large containers acrylic tubes for example in an area with direct sunlight it may also be used to saturate other types material such as soil to increase heat capacity concrete clay bricks and other forms of masonry the thermal conductivity of concrete depends on its composition and curing technique concretes with stones are more thermally conductive than concretes with ash perlite fibers and other insulating aggregates insulated concrete panels consist of an inner layer of concrete to provide the thermal mass factor this is insulated from the outside by a conventional foam insulation and then covered again with an outer layer of concrete the effect is a highly efficient building insulation envelope insulating concrete forms are commonly used to provide thermal mass to building structures insulating concrete forms provide the specific heat capacity and mass of concrete thermal inertia of the structure is very high because the mass is insulated on both sides clay brick adobe brick or mudbrick see brick and adobe earth mud and sod dirts heat capacity depends on its density moisture content particle shape temperature and composition early settlers to nebraska built houses with thick walls made of dirt and sod because wood stone and other building materials were scarce the extreme thickness of the walls provided some insulation but mainly served as thermal mass absorbing thermal energy during the day and releasing it during the night nowadays people sometimes use earth sheltering around their homes for the same effect in earth sheltering the thermal mass comes not only from the walls of the building but from the surrounding earth that is in physical contact with the building this provides a fairly constant moderating temperature that reduces heat flow through the adjacent wall rammed earth rammed earth provides excellent thermal mass because of its high density and the high specific heat capacity of the soil used in its construction natural rock and stone see stonemasonry logs are used as a building material to create the exterior and perhaps also the interior walls of homes log homes differ from some other construction materials listed above because solid wood has both moderate r-value insulation and also significant thermal mass in contrast water earth rocks and concrete all have low r-values 3 phase-change materials seasonal energy storageedit if enough mass is used it can create a seasonal advantage that is it can heat in the winter and cool in the summer this is sometimes called passive annual heat storage or pahs the pahs system has been
