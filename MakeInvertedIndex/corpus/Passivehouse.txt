passive house passive house german passivhaus is a rigorous voluntary standard for energy efficiency in a building reducing its ecological footprint 1 it results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling 2 3 a similar standard minergie-p is used in switzerland 4 the standard is not confined to residential properties several office buildings schools kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard passive design is not an attachment or supplement to architectural design but a design process that is integrated with architectural design 5 although it is mostly applied to new buildings it has also been used for refurbishments estimates of the number of passivhaus buildings around the world in late 2008 ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 structures 6 7 as of august 2010 there were approximately 25,000 such certified structures of all types in europe while in the united states there were only 13 with a few dozen more under construction 1 the vast majority of passive structures have been built in german-speaking countries and scandinavia 6  contents 1 history 1.1 first examples 1.2 further implementation and

institut für wohnen und umwelt institute for housing and the environment germany 8 their concept was developed through a number of research projects 9 aided by financial assistance from the german state of hessen first examplesedit the eventual building of four row houses terraced houses or town homes was designed for four private clients by the architectural firm of bott ridder and westermeyer the first passivhaus residences were built in darmstadt germany in 1990 and occupied by the clients the following year further implementation and councilsedit in september 1996 the passivhaus-institut was founded also in darmstadt to promote and control the standards since then thousands of passivhaus structures have been built to an estimated 25,000 as of 2010 1 6 10 most are located in germany and austria with others in various countries worldwide after the concept had been validated at darmstadt with space heating 90 less than required for a standard new building of the time the economical passive houses working group was created in 1996 this group developed the planning package and initiated the production of the innovative components that had been used notably the windows and the high-efficiency ventilation systems meanwhile further passive houses were built in stuttgart  1993 naumburg hesse wiesbaden and cologne  1997 11 the products developed for the passivhaus standard were further commercialised during and following the european union sponsored cepheus project which proved the concept in five european countries over the winter of 2000–2001 in north america the first passivhaus was built in urbana illinois in 2003 12 and the first to be certified was built in 2006 near bemidji minnesota in camp waldsee of the german concordia language villages 13 the first us passive retrofit project was certified in july 2010 the remodeled 2,400 sf craftsman oneill house in sonoma california 14 irelands first passive house  15 was built in 2005 by tomas oleary a passive house designer and teacher the house was called out of the blue upon completion tomas moved into the building 16 the worlds first standardised passive prefabricated house was built in ireland in 2005 by scandinavian homes 17 18 a swedish company that has since built more passive houses in england and poland 19 present dayedit estimates in 2008 of the number of passive houses around the world ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 20 21 the vast majority have been built in german-speaking countries or scandinavia 20 the first certified passive house in the antwerpen region of belgium was built in 2010 22 in 2011 the city of heidelberg in germany initiated the bahnstadt project which was seen as the worlds largest passive house building areas 23 a company in qatar is planning the countrys first passivhaus in 2013 24 the first in the region standardsedit while some techniques and technologies were specifically developed for the passive house standard others such as superinsulation already existed and the concept of passive solar building design dates back to antiquity there was also other previous experience with low-energy building standards notably the german niedrigenergiehaus low-energy house standard as well as from buildings constructed to the demanding energy codes of sweden and denmark standardsedit the passivhaus standard requires that the building fulfills the following requirements 25 26 the building must be designed to have an annual heating and cooling demand as calculated with the passivhaus planning package of not more than 15kwhm2  4,755btusqft 5.017mjsqft per year in heating or cooling energy or be designed with a peak heat load of 10wm2  1.2hp/1000sqft total primary energy source energy for electricity etc consumption primary energy for heating hot water and electricity must not be more than 120kwhm2  38,040btusqft 40.13mjsqft per year the building must not leak more air than 0.6 times the house volume per hour n50  0.6  hour at 50pa  0.0073psi as tested by a blower door or alternatively when looked at the surface area of the enclosure the leakage rate must be less than 0.05 cubic feet per minute recommendationsedit further the specific heat load for the heating source at design temperature is recommended but not required to be less than 10 wm  3.17 btuhft these standards are much higher than houses built to most normal building codes for comparisons see the international comparisons section below national partners within the consortium for the promotion of european passive houses are thought to have some flexibility to adapt these limits locally 27 space heating requirementedit by achieving the passivhaus standards qualified buildings are able to dispense with conventional heating systems while this is an underlying objective of the passivhaus standard some type of heating will still be required and most passivhaus buildings do include a system to provide supplemental space heating this is normally distributed through the low-volume heat recovery ventilation system that is required to maintain air quality rather than by a conventional hydronic or high-volume forced-air heating system as described in the space heating section below construction costsedit in passivhaus buildings the cost savings from dispensing with the conventional heating system can be used to fund the upgrade of the building envelope and the heat recovery ventilation system with careful design and increasing competition in the supply of the specifically designed passivhaus building products in germany it is now possible to construct buildings for the same cost as those built to normal german building standards as was done with the passivhaus apartments at vauban freiburg 28 on average passive houses are reported to be more expensive upfront than conventional buildings - 5 to 8 in germany 29 30 8 to 10 in uk 31 and 5 to 10 in usa 32 33 34 35 evaluations have indicated that while it is technically possible the costs of meeting the passivhaus standard increase significantly when building in northern europe above 60 latitude 36 37 european cities at approximately 60 include helsinki in finland and bergen in norway london is at 51 moscow is at 55 these facts have led a number of architects to construct buildings that use the ground under the building for massive heat storage to shift heat production from the winter to the summer some buildings can also shift cooling from the summer to the winter at least one designer uses a passive thermosiphon carrying only air so the process can be accomplished without expensive unreliable machinery 38 see also annualized geo solar design and constructionedit achieving the major decrease in heating energy consumption required by the standard involves a shift in approach to building design and construction design may be assisted by use of the passivhaus planning package phpp 39 which uses specifically designed computer simulations to achieve the standards a number of techniques and technologies are used in combination 2 passive solar design and landscapeedit passive solar building design and energy-efficient landscaping support the passive house energy conservation and can integrate them into a neighborhood and environment following passive solar building techniques where possible buildings are compact in shape to reduce their surface area with principal windows oriented towards the equator - south in the northern hemisphere and north in the southern hemisphere - to maximize passive solar gain however the use of solar gain especially in temperate climate regions is secondary to minimizing the overall house energy requirements in climates and regions needing to reduce excessive summer passive solar heat gain whether from direct or reflected sources brise soleil trees attached pergolas with vines vertical gardens green roofs and other techniques are implemented passive houses can be constructed from dense or lightweight materials but some internal thermal mass is normally incorporated to reduce summer peak temperatures maintain stable winter temperatures and prevent possible overheating in spring or autumn before the higher sun angle shades mid-day wall exposure and window penetration exterior wall color when the surface allows choice for reflection or absorption insolation qualities depends on the predominant year-round ambient outdoor temperature the use of deciduous trees and wall trellised or self attaching vines can assist in climates not at the temperature extremes superinsulationedit passivhaus buildings employ superinsulation to significantly reduce the heat transfer through the walls roof and floor compared to conventional buildings 40 a wide range of thermal insulation materials can be used to provide the required high r-values low u-values typically in the 0.10 to 0.15 wmk range special attention is given to eliminating thermal bridges a disadvantage resulting from the thickness of wall insulation required is that unless the external dimensions of the building can be enlarged to compensate the internal floor area of the building may be less compared to traditional construction in sweden to achieve passive house standards the insulation thickness would be 335mm about 13 in  0.10 wmk and the roof 500mm about 20 in u-value 0.066 wmk advanced window technologyedit to meet the requirements of the passivhaus standard windows are manufactured with exceptionally high r-values low u-values typically 0.85 to 0.70 wmk for the entire window including the frame these normally combine triple-pane insulated glazing with a good solar heat-gain coefficient 2 40 low-emissivity coatings sealed argon or krypton gas filled inter-pane voids and warm edge insulating glass spacers with air-seals and specially developed thermally broken window frames in central europe and most of the united states for unobstructed south-facing passivhaus windows the heat gains from the sun are on average greater than the heat losses even in mid-winter airtightnessedit building envelopes under the passivhaus standard are required to be extremely airtight compared to conventional construction they are required to meet either 0.60 ach50 air changes per hour at 50 pascals based on the buildings volume or 0.05 cfm50sf cubic feet per minute at 50 pascals per square foot of building enclosure surface area in order to achieve these metrics recommended best practice is to test the building air barrier enclosure with a blower door at mid-construction if possible 2 passive house is designed so that most of the air exchange with exterior is done by controlled ventilation through a heat-exchanger in order to minimize heat loss or gain depending on climate so uncontrolled air leaks are best avoided 2 another reason is the passive house standard makes extensive use of insulation which usually requires a careful management of moisture and dew points 41 this is achieved through air barriers careful sealing of every construction joint in the building envelope and sealing of all service penetrations 40 ventilationedit use of passive natural ventilation is an integral component of passive house design where ambient temperature is conducive  either by singular or cross ventilation by a simple opening or enhanced by the stack effect from smaller ingress with larger egress windows andor clerestory-operable skylight when ambient climate is not conducive mechanical heat recovery ventilation systems with a heat recovery rate of over 80 and high-efficiency electronically commutated motors ecm are employed to maintain air quality and to recover sufficient heat to dispense with a conventional central heating system 2 since passively designed buildings are essentially air-tight the rate of air change can be optimized and carefully controlled at about 0.4 air changes per hour all ventilation ducts are insulated and sealed against leakage some passivhaus builders promote the use of earth warming tubes typically ≈200mm ~7,9 in diameter ≈40 m ~130ft long at a depth of ≈1.5 m ~5ft these are buried in the soil to act as earth-to-air heat exchangers and pre-heat or pre-cool the intake air for the ventilation system in cold weather the warmed air also prevents ice formation in the heat recovery systems heat exchanger concerns about this technique have arisen in some climates due to problems with condensation and mold 42 alternatively an earth to air heat exchanger can use a liquid circuit instead of an air circuit with a heat exchanger battery on the supply air space heatingedit in addition to using passive solar gain passivhaus buildings make extensive use of their intrinsic heat from internal sourcessuch as waste heat from lighting white goods major appliances and other electrical devices but not dedicated heatersas well as body heat from the people and other animals inside the building this is due to the fact that people on average emit heat equivalent to 100 watts each of radiated thermal energy together with the comprehensive energy conservation measures taken this means that a conventional central heating system is not necessary although they are sometimes installed due to client skepticism 43 instead passive houses sometimes have a dual purpose 800 to 1,500 watt heating andor cooling element integrated with the supply air duct of the ventilation system for use during the coldest days it is fundamental to the design that all the heat required can be transported by the normal low air volume required for ventilation a maximum air temperature of 50c  122f is applied to prevent any possible smell of scorching from dust that escapes the filters in the system the air-heating element can be heated by a small heat pump by direct solar thermal energy annualized geothermal solar or simply by a natural gas or oil burner in some cases a micro-heat pump is used to extract additional heat from the exhaust ventilation air using it to heat either the incoming air or the hot water storage tank small wood-burning stoves can also be used to heat the water tank although care is required to ensure that the room in which stove is located does not overheat beyond the recovery of heat by the heat recovery ventilation unit a well designed passive house in the european climate should not need any supplemental heat source if the heating load is kept under 10wm 44 because the heating capacity and the heating energy required by a passive house both are very low the particular energy source selected has fewer financial implications than in a traditional building although renewable energy sources are well suited to such low loads the passive house standards in europe determine a space heating and cooling energy demand of 15 kilowatt hours per square meter of treated floor area per year or 10 watts per square meter peak demand or in imperial units 4.75 kbtusfyr and 3.2 btuhrsf respectively in addition the total energy to be used in the building operations including heating cooling lighting equipment hot water plug loads etc is limited to 120 kilowatt hours per square meter of treated floor area per year or in imperial units 38.0 btusfyr 45 lighting and electrical appliancesedit to minimize the total primary energy consumption the many passive and active daylighting techniques are the first daytime solution to employ for low light level days non-daylighted spaces and nighttime the use of creative-sustainable lighting design using low-energy sources such as standard voltage compact fluorescent lamps and solid-state lighting with light-emitting diode-led lamps organic light-emitting diodes and pled - polymer light-emitting diodes and low voltage electrical filament-incandescent light bulbs and compact metal halide xenon and halogen lamps can be used solar powered exterior circulation security and landscape lighting - with photovoltaic cells on each fixture or connecting to a central solar panel system are available for gardens and outdoor needs low voltage systems can be used for more controlled or independent illumination while still using less electricity than conventional fixtures and lamps timers motion detection and natural light operation sensors reduce energy consumption and light pollution even further for a passivhaus setting appliance consumer products meeting independent energy efficiency testing and receiving ecolabel certification marks for reduced electrical-natural-gas consumption and product manufacturing carbon emission labels are preferred for use in passive houses the ecolabel certification marks of energy star and ekoenergy are examples traits of passive housesedit typically passive houses feature fresh clean air note that for the parameters tested and provided the filters minimum f6 are maintained hepa quality air is provided 0.3 air changes per hour ach are recommended otherwise the air can become stale excess co2 flushing of indoor air pollutants and any greater excessively dry less than 40 humidity this implies careful selection of interior finishes and furnishings to minimize indoor air pollution from vocs eg formaldehyde this can be counteracted somewhat by opening a window for a very brief time by plants and by indoor fountains because of the high resistance to heat flow high r-value insulation there are no outside walls which are colder than other walls homogeneous interior temperature it is impossible to have single rooms eg the sleeping rooms at a different temperature from the rest of the house note that the relatively high temperature of the sleeping areas is physiologically not considered desirable by some building scientists bedroom windows can be cracked open slightly to alleviate this when necessary slow temperature changes with ventilation and heating systems switched off a passive house typically loses less than 0.5c  1f per day in winter stabilizing at around 15c  59f in the central european climate quick return to normal temperature opening windows or doors for a short time has only a limited effect after apertures are closed the air very quickly returns to the normal temperature some have voiced concerns that passivhaus is not a general approach as the occupant has to behave in a prescribed way for example not opening windows too often however modelling shows that such concerns are not valid 46 international comparisonsedit in the united states a house built to the passive house standard results in a building that requires space heating energy of 1 btu per square foot  11 kjm per heating degree day compared with about 5 to 15 btus per square foot  56-170 kjm per heating degree day for a similar building built to meet the 2003 model energy efficiency code this is between 75 and 95 less energy for space heating and cooling than current new buildings that meet todays us energy efficiency codes the passivhaus in the german-language camp of waldsee minnesota was designed under the guidance of architect stephan tanner of intep llc a minneapolis- and munich-based consulting company for high performance and sustainable construction waldsee biohaus is modeled on germanys passivhaus standard beyond that of the us leed standard which improves quality of life inside the building while using 85 less energy than a house built to minnesota building codes 47 volkshouse 1.0 was the first certified passive house offered and sold in santa fe new mexico 48 in the united kingdom an average new house built to the passive house standard would use 77 less energy for space heating compared to the circa-2006 building regulations 49 in ireland it is calculated that a typical house built to the passive house standard instead of the 2002 building regulations would consume 85 less energy for space heating and cut space-heating related carbon emissions by 94 50 comparison with zero energy buildingsedit a net zero-energy building zeb is a building that over a year does not use more energy than it generates the first 1979 zero energy design building used passive solar heating and cooling techniques with air-tight construction and super insulation a few zebs fail to fully exploit more affordable conservation technology and all use onsite active renewable energy technologies like photovoltaic to offset the buildings primary energy consumption passive house and zeb are complementary synergistic technology approaches based on the same physics of thermal energy transfer and storage zebs drive the annual energy consumption down to 0 kwhm with help from on-site renewable energy sources and can benefit from materials and methods which are used to meet the passive house demand constraint of 120 kwhm which will minimize the need for the often costly on-site renewable energy sources energy plus houses are similar to both passivhaus and zeb but emphasize the production of more energy per year than they consume eg annual energy performance of -25 kwhm is an energy plus house tropical climate needsedit in a tropical climate it could be helpful for ideal internal conditions to use energy recovery ventilation instead of heat recovery ventilation to reduce the humidity load of ventilation on the mechanical dehumidification system although dehumidifiers might be used heat pump hot water heaters also will act to cool and condense interior humidity where it can be dumped into drains  and dump the heat into the hot water tank passive cooling solar air conditioning and other solutions in passive solar building design need to be studied to adapt the passive house concept for use in more regions of the world there is a certified passive house in the hot and humid climate of lafayette louisiana usa which uses energy recovery ventilation and an efficient one ton air-conditioner to provide cooling and dehumidification 51 52 solar access is a very important factor in any design of a passive house as it allows the structure to use the solar energy to heat and light the space naturally replace electrical water heaters with solar-energy-based water heaters see alsoedit energy portal
