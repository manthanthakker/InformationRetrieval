pedro fages became the first european to enter it from the south by way of the grapevine canyon kern county was the site of the battle of san emigdio in march 1824 between the chumash indians of the santa barbara mission who rebelled against the mexican governments taking over mission property and ejecting the natives this battle with mexican forces from monterey under the command of carlos carrillo took place at the canyon where san emigdio creek flows down san emigdio mountain and the blue ridge south of bakersfield near todays highway 166 it was a low-casualty encounter with only four indians killed and no mexicans the surviving indians were pacified and brought back to santa barbara in june 1824 after a pursuit and negotiation in which many were allowed to keep their arms for the return march over the mountains 6 american eraedit in the beginning the area that became kern county was dominated by mining in the mountains and in the desert in 1855 an attempt to form a county in the area was made when the california legislature took the southeastern territory of tulare county on the west of the sierra nevada mountains for buena vista county but it was never officially organized prior to 1859 when the time of the enabling legislation ran out the south of tulare county was later organized as kern county in 1866 with additions from los angeles and san bernardino counties its first county seat was in the mining town of havilah in the mountains between bakersfield and tehachapicitation needed the flatlands were considered inhospitable and impassable at the time due to swamps lakes tule reeds and diseases such as malaria this changed when settlers started draining lands for farming and constructing canals most dug by hand by hired chinese laborers within 10 years the valley surpassed the mining areas as the economic center of the county and the county seat was moved as a result from havilah to bakersfield in 1874citation needed the discovery well of the kern river oil field was dug by hand in 1899 7 soon the towns of oil city oil center and oildale came into existence 7 etymologyedit the county derives its name from the kern river which was named for

1906 san francisco earthquake tehachapi suffered the greatest damage and loss of life from the earthquake though its effects were widely felt throughout central and southern california the event had a significant aftershock sequence that persisted into july and august with the strongest coming on august 22 an m5.8 event with a maximum perceived intensity of viii severe and resulted in two additional deaths and an additional $10 million in property damage repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving non-reinforced masonry buildings following the event a field survey was conducted along the fault zone with the goal of estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed both in the valley and in the foothills with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicenter area the strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers abuse trialsedit between 1983 and 1986 several ritual
