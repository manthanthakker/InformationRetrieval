marine energy biofuel biomass geothermal hydropower solar energy tidal power wave power wind power topics by country 100 renewable energy marketing and policy trends v t e marine energy or marine power also sometimes referred to as ocean energy ocean power or marine and hydrokinetic energy refers to the energy carried by ocean waves tides salinity and ocean temperature differences the movement of water in the worlds oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy or energy in motion this energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes transport and industries the term marine energy encompasses both wave power ie power from surface waves and tidal power ie obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy as wind power is derived from the wind even if the wind turbines are placed over water the oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world 1energy from the ocean is also known as hydroelectricity  contents 1 global potential 2 forms of

area is ocean has 49gw recognized potential ocean energy and has 727gw theoretical potential ocean energy 4 forms of ocean energyedit renewableedit the oceans represent a vast and largely untapped source of energy in the form of surface waves fluid flow salinity gradients and thermal marine and hydrokinetic mhk or marine energy development in us and international waters includes projects using the following devices wave power converters in open coastal areas with significant waves tidal turbines placed in coastal and estuarine areas in-stream turbines in fast-moving rivers ocean current turbines in areas of strong marine currents ocean thermal energy converters in deep tropical waters marine current poweredit strong ocean currents are generated from a combination of temperature wind salinity bathymetry and the rotation of the earth the sun acts as the primary driving force causing winds and temperature differences because there are only small fluctuations in current speed and stream location with no changes in direction ocean currents may be suitable locations for deploying energy extraction devices such as turbines ocean currents are instrumental in determining the climate in many regions around the world while little is known about the effects of removing ocean current energy the impacts of removing current energy on the farfield environment may be a significant environmental concern the typical turbine issues with blade strike entanglement of marine organisms and acoustic effects still exists however these may be magnified due to the presence of more diverse populations of marine organisms using ocean currents for migration purposes locations can be further offshore and therefore require longer power cables that could affect the marine environment with electromagnetic output 5 osmotic poweredit at the mouth of rivers where fresh water mixes with salt water energy associated with the salinity gradient can be harnessed using pressure-retarded reverse osmosis process and associated conversion technologies another system is based on using freshwater upwelling through a turbine immersed in seawater and one involving electrochemical reactions is also in development significant research took place from 1975 to 1985 and gave various results regarding the economy of pro and red plants it is important to note that small-scale investigations into salinity power production take place in other countries like japan israel and the united states in europe the research is concentrated in norway and the netherlands in both places small pilots are tested salinity gradient energy is the energy available from the difference in salt concentration between freshwater with saltwater this energy source is not easy to understand as it is not directly occurring in nature in the form of heat waterfalls wind waves or radiation 6 ocean thermal energyedit water typically varies in temperature from the surface warmed by direct sunlight to greater depths where sunlight cannot penetrate this differential is greatest in tropical waters making this technology most applicable in water locations a fluid is often vaporized to drive a turbine that may generate electricity or produce desalinized water systems may be either open-cycle closed-cycle or hybrid 7 tidal poweredit the energy from moving masses of water  a popular form of hydroelectric power generation tidal power generation comprises three main forms namely tidal stream power tidal barrage power and dynamic tidal power wave poweredit solar energy from the sun creates temperature differentials that result in wind the interaction between wind and the surface of water creates waves which are larger when there is a greater distance for them to build up wave energy potential is greatest between 30 and 60 latitude in both hemispheres on the west coast because of the global direction of wind when evaluating wave energy as a technology type it is important to distinguish between the four most common approaches point absorber buoys surface attenuators oscillating water columns and overtopping devices 8 the wave energy sector is reaching a significant milestone in the development of the industry with positive steps towards commercial viability being taken the more advanced device developers are now progressing beyond single unit demonstration devices and are proceeding to array development and multi-megawatt projects 9 the backing of major utility companies is now manifesting itself through partnerships within the development process unlocking further investment and in some cases international co-operation at a simplified level wave energy technology can be located near-shore and offshore wave energy converters can also be designed for operation in specific water depth conditions deep water intermediate water or shallow water the fundamental device design will be dependent on the location of the device and the intended resource characteristics non-renewableedit petroleum and natural gas beneath the ocean floor are also sometimes considered a form of ocean energy an ocean engineer directs all phases of discovering extracting and delivering offshore petroleum via oil tankers and pipelines a complex and demanding task also centrally important is the development of new methods to protect marine wildlife and coastal regions against the undesirable side effects of offshore oil extraction marine energy developmentedit the uk is leading the way in wave and tidal marine power generation the worlds first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to kick start the development of the marine energy industry in the uk based in orkney scotland the european marine energy centre emec has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world the centre was established with around £36 million of funding from the scottish government highlands and islands enterprise the carbon trust uk government scottish enterprise the european union and orkney islands council and is the only accredited wave and tidal test centre for marine renewable energy in the world suitable for testing a number of full-scale devices simultaneously in some of the harshest weather conditions while producing electricity to the national grid clients that have tested at the
