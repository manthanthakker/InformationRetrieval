and especially the relationship between danes and denmark and the unifying of denmark as a single kingdom is a subject which attracts debate 17 18 this is centred primarily on the prefix dan and whether it refers to the dani or a historical person dan and the exact meaning of the -mark ending most handbooks derive the first part of the word and the name of the people from a word meaning flat land 19 related to german tenne threshing floor english den cave 19 the -mark is believed to mean woodland or borderland see marches with probable references to the border forests in south schleswig 20 the first recorded use of the word danmark within denmark itself is found on the two jelling stones which are runestones believed to have been erected by gorm the old c 955 and harald bluetooth c 965 the larger stone of the two is popularly cited as denmarks baptismal certificate dåbsattest 21 though both use the word denmark in the form of accusative ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚢᚱᚴ tanmaurk danmɒrk on the large stone and genitive ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚱᚴᛅᚱ tanmarkar pronounced danmarkaɽ on the small stone 22 the inhabitants of denmark are there called tani danɪ or danes in the accusative historyedit prehistoryedit the earliest archaeological findings in denmark date back to the eem interglacial period from 130,000–110,000 bc 23 denmark has been inhabited since around 12,500 bc and agriculture has been evident since 3900 bc 24 the nordic bronze age  1800–600 bc in denmark was marked by burial mounds which left an abundance of findings including lurs and the sun chariot during the pre-roman iron age  500 bc ad 1 native groups began migrating south and the first tribal danes came to the country between the pre-roman and the germanic iron age 25 in the roman iron age ad 1–400 24 the roman provinces maintained trade routes and relations with native tribes in denmark and roman coins have been found in denmark evidence of strong celtic cultural influence dates from this period in denmark and much of north-west europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the gundestrup cauldron the tribal danes came from the east danish islands zealand and scania and spoke an early form of north germanic historians believe that before their arrival most of jutland and the nearest islands were settled by tribal jutes the jutes migrated to great britain eventually some as mercenaries by brythonic king vortigern and were granted the south-eastern territories of kent the isle of wight and other areas where they settled they were later absorbed or ethnically cleansed by the invading angles and saxons who formed the anglo-saxons the remaining jutish population in jutland assimilated in with the settling danes a short note about the dani in getica by the historian jordanes is believed to be an early mention of the danes one of the ethnic groups from whom modern danes are descended 26 27 the danevirke defence structures were built in phases from the 3rd century forward and the sheer size of the construction efforts in ad 737 are attributed to the emergence of a danish king 28 a new runic alphabet was first used around the same time and ribe the oldest town of denmark was founded about ad 700 viking and middle agesedit from the 8th to the 10th century the wider scandinavian region was the source of vikings they colonised raided and traded in all parts of europe the danish vikings were most active in the eastern and southern british isles and western europe they conquered and settled parts of england known as the danelaw under king sweyn forkbeard in 1013 and france where danes and norwegians founded normandy with rollo as head of state more anglo-saxon pence of this period have been found in denmark than in england 29 denmark was largely consolidated by the late 8th century and its rulers are consistently referred to in frankish sources as kings reges under the reign of gudfred in 804 the danish kingdom may have included all the lands of jutland scania and the danish islands excluding bornholm 30 the extant danish monarchy traces its roots back to gorm the old who established his reign in the early 10th century 2 as attested by the jelling stones the danes were christianised around 965 by harald bluetooth the son of gorm it is believed that denmark became christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising christian power in europe the holy roman empire which was an important trading area for the danes in that case harald built six fortresses around denmark called trelleborg and built a further danevirke in the early 11th century canute the great won and united denmark england and norway for almost 30 years with a scandinavian army 29 throughout the high and late middle ages denmark also included skåneland the areas of scania halland and blekinge in present-day south sweden and danish kings ruled danish estonia as well as the duchies of schleswig and holstein most of the latter two now form the state of schleswig-holstein in northern germany in 1397 denmark entered into a personal union with norway and sweden united under queen margaret i 31 the three countries were to be treated as equals in the union however even from the start margaret may not have been so idealistictreating denmark as the clear senior partner of the union 32 thus much of the next 125 years of scandinavian history revolves around this union with sweden breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly the issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 june 1523 as swedish king gustav vasa conquered the city of stockholm the protestant reformation spread to scandinavia in the 1530s and following the counts feud civil war denmark converted to lutheranism in 1536 later that year denmark entered into a union with norway early modern history  1536–1849edit after sweden permanently broke away from the personal union denmark tried on several occasions to reassert control over its neighbour king christian iv attacked sweden in the 1611–1613 kalmar war but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing it to return to the union the war led to no territorial changes but sweden was forced to pay a war indemnity of 1 million silver riksdaler to denmark an amount known as the älvsborg ransom 33 king christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses most notably glückstadt founded as a rival to hamburg and christiania inspired by the dutch east india company he founded a similar danish company and planned to claim ceylon as a colony but the company only managed to acquire tranquebar on indias coromandel coast denmarks large colonial aspirations were limited to a few key trading posts in africa and india the empire was sustained by trade with other major powers and plantations  ultimately a lack of resources led to its stagnation 34 in the thirty years war christian tried to become the leader of the lutheran states in germany but suffered a crushing defeat at the battle of lutter 35 the result was that the catholic army under albrecht von wallenstein was able to invade occupy and pillage jutland forcing denmark to withdraw from the war 36 denmark managed to avoid territorial concessions but king gustavus adolphus intervention in germany was seen as a sign that the military power of sweden was on the rise while denmarks influence in the region was declining in 1643 swedish armies invaded jutland and claimed scania in 1644 in the 1645 treaty of brømsebro denmark surrendered halland gotland the last parts of danish estonia and several provinces in norway in 1657 king frederick iii declared war on sweden and marched on bremen-verden this led to a massive danish defeat and the armies of king charles x gustav of sweden conquered both jutland funen and much of zealand before signing the peace of roskilde in february 1658 which gave sweden control of scania blekinge trøndelag and the island of bornholm charles x gustav quickly regretted not having wrecked denmark and in august 1658 he began a two-year-long siege of copenhagen but failed to take the capital 37 in the following peace settlement denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of trøndelag and bornholm denmark tried to regain control of scania in the scanian war  1675–1679 but it ended in failure following the great northern war  1700–21 denmark managed to restore control of the parts of schleswig and holstein ruled by the house of holstein-gottorp in 1721 and 1773 respectively denmark prospered greatly in the last decades of the eighteenth century due to its neutral status allowing it to trade with both sides in the many contemporary wars in the napoleonic wars denmark traded with both france and the united kingdom and joined the league of armed neutrality with russia sweden and prussia 38 the british considered this a hostile act and attacked copenhagen in both 1801 and 1807 in one case carrying off the danish fleet in the other burning large parts of the danish capital this led to the so-called danish-british gunboat war british control over the waterways between denmark and norway proved disastrous to the unions economy and in 1813 denmarknorway went bankrupt the danish-norwegian union was dissolved by the treaty of kiel in 1814 the danish monarchy irrevocably and forever renounced claims to the kingdom of norway in favour of the swedish king 39 after the dissolution of the union with norway denmark kept the possessions of iceland which retained the danish monarchy until 1944 the faroe islands and greenland all of which had been governed by norway for centuries 40 apart from the nordic colonies denmark continued to rule over danish india from 1620 to 1869 the danish gold coast ghana from 1658 to 1850 and the danish west indies from 1671 to 1917 constitutional monarchy  1849presentedit a nascent danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s after the european revolutions of 1848 denmark peacefully became a constitutional monarchy on 5 june 1849 a new constitution established a two-chamber parliament denmark faced war against both prussia and habsburg austria in what became known as the second schleswig war lasting from february to october 1864 denmark was defeated and obliged to cede schleswig and holstein to prussia this loss came as the latest in the long series of defeats and territorial loss that had begun in the 17th century after these events denmark pursued a policy of neutrality in europe industrialisation came to denmark in the second half of the 19th century 41 the nations first railroads were constructed in the 1850s and improved communications and overseas trade allowed industry to develop in spite of denmarks lack of natural resources trade unions developed starting in the 1870s there was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities and danish agriculture became centred on the export of dairy and meat products denmark maintained its neutral stance during world war i after the defeat of germany the versailles powers offered to return the region of schleswig-holstein to denmark fearing german irredentism denmark refused to consider the return of the area without a plebiscite the two schleswig plebiscites took place on 10 february and 14 march 1920 respectively on 10 july 1920 northern schleswig was recovered by denmark thereby adding some 163,600 inhabitants and 3,984 square kilometres  1,538sqmi in 1939 denmark signed a 10-year non-aggression pact with nazi germany but germany invaded denmark on 9 april 1940 and the danish government quickly surrendered world war ii in denmark was characterised by economic co-operation with germany until 1943 when the danish government refused further co-operation and its navy scuttled most of its ships and sent many of its officers to sweden which was neutral the danish resistance performed a rescue operation that managed to evacuate several thousand jews and their families to safety in sweden before the germans could send them to death camps some danes supported nazism by joining the danish nazi party or volunteering to fight with germany as part of the frikorps danmark 42 iceland severed ties to denmark and became an independent republic in 1944 germany surrendered in may 1945 in 1948 the faroe islands gained home rule in 1949 denmark became a founding member of nato denmark was a founding member of european free trade association efta during the 1960s the efta countries were often referred to as the outer seven as opposed to the inner six of what was then the european economic community eec 43 in 1973 along with britain and ireland denmark joined the european economic community now the european union after a public referendum the maastricht treaty which involved further european integration was rejected by the danish people in 1992 it was only accepted after a second referendum in 1993 which provided for four opt-outs from policies the danes rejected the euro as the national currency in a referendum in 2000 greenland gained home rule in 1979 and was awarded self-determination in 2009 neither the faroe islands nor greenland are members of the union the faroese having declined membership of the eec in 1973 and greenland in 1986 in both cases because of fisheries policies constitutional change in 1953 led to a single-chamber parliament elected by proportional representation female accession to the danish throne and greenland becoming an integral part of denmark the centre-left social democrats led a string of coalition governments for most of the second half of the 20th century introducing the nordic welfare model the liberal party and the conservative peoples party have also led centre-right governments in recent years the right-wing populist 44 danish peoples party has emerged as a major partybecoming the second-largest following the 2015 general electionduring which time immigration and integration have become major issues of public debate geographyedit located in northern europe denmarkn 2 consists of the peninsula of jutland and 443 named islands  1,419 islands above 100 square metres  1,100sqft in total 46 of these 74 are inhabited january 2015 47 with the largest being zealand the north jutlandic island and funen the island of bornholm is located east of the rest of the country in the baltic sea many of the larger islands are connected by bridges the øresund bridge connects zealand with sweden the great belt bridge connects funen with zealand and the little belt bridge connects jutland with funen ferries or small aircraft connect to the smaller islands the largest cities with populations over 100,000 are the capital copenhagen on zealand aarhus and aalborg in jutland and odense on funen the country occupies a total area of 42,924 square kilometres  16,573sqmi 3 the area of inland water is 700km2  270sqmi variously stated as from 500  700km2  193–270 sq m lake arresø northwest of copenhagen is the largest lake the size of the land area cannot be stated exactly since the ocean constantly erodes and adds material to the coastline and because of human land reclamation projects to counter erosion post-glacial rebound raises the land by a bit less than 1cm  0.4in per year in the north and east extending the coast a circle enclosing the same area as denmark would be 234 kilometres  145 miles in diameter with a circumference of 742km  461mi it shares a border of 68 kilometres  42mi with germany to the south and is otherwise surrounded by 8,750km  5,437mi of tidal shoreline including small bays and inlets 48 no location in denmark is further from the coast than 52km  32mi on the south-west coast of jutland the tide is between 1 and 2m  3.28 and 6.56ft and the tideline moves outward and inward on a 10km  6.2mi stretch 49 denmarks territorial waters total 105,000 square kilometres  40,541 square miles denmarks northernmost point is skagens point the north beach of the skaw at 57 45 7 northern latitude the southernmost is gedser point the southern tip of falster at 54 33 35 northern latitude the westernmost point is blåvandshuk at 8 4 22 eastern longitude and the easternmost point is østerskær at 15 11 55 eastern longitude this is in the archipelago ertholmene 18 kilometres  11mi north-east of bornholm the distance from east to west is 452 kilometres  281mi from north to south 368 kilometres  229mi the country is flat with little elevation having an average height above sea level of 31 metres  102ft the highest natural point is møllehøj at 170.86 metres  560.56ft 50 a sizeable portion of denmarks terrain consists of rolling plains whilst the coastline is sandy with large dunes in northern jutland although once extensively forested today denmark largely consists of arable land it is drained by a dozen or so rivers and the most significant include the gudenå odense skjern suså and vidåa river that flows along its southern border with germany the kingdom of denmark includes two overseas territories both well to the west of denmark greenland the worlds largest island and the faroe islands in the north atlantic ocean these territories are self-governing and form part of the danish realm climateedit denmark has a temperate climate characterised by mild winters with mean temperatures in january of 1.5c  34.7f and cool summers with a mean temperature in august of 17.2c  63.0f 51 the most extreme temperatures recorded in denmark since 1874 when recordings began was 36.4c  97.5f in 1975 and −31.02c −23.84f in 1982 52 denmark has an average of 179 days per year with precipitation on average receiving a total of 765 millimetres  30in per year autumn is the wettest season and spring the driest 51 the position between a continent and an ocean means that weather often changes 53 because of denmarks northern location there are large seasonal variations in daylight there are short days during the winter with sunrise coming around 8:45am and sunset 3:45pm standard time as well as long summer days with sunrise at 4:30am and sunset at 10pm daylight saving time 54 biodiversity and environmentedit denmark belongs to the boreal kingdom and can be subdivided into two ecoregions the atlantic mixed forests and baltic mixed forests 55 almost all of denmarks primeval temperate forests have been destroyed or fragmented chiefly for agricultural purposes during the last millennia 56 the deforestation has created large swaths of heathland and devastating sand drifts 56 in spite of this there are several larger second growth woodlands in the country and in total 12.9 of the land is now forested 57 roe deer occupy the countryside in growing numbers and large-antlered red deer can be found in the sparse woodlands of jutland denmark is also home to smaller mammals such as polecats hares and hedgehogs 58 approximately 400 bird species inhabit denmark and about 160 of those breed in the country 59 large marine mammals include healthy populations of harbour porpoise growing numbers of pinnipeds and occasional visits of large whales including blue whales and orcas cod herring and plaice are abundant fish in danish waters and form the basis for a large fishing industry 60 land and water pollution are two of denmarks most significant environmental issues although much of the countrys household and industrial waste is now increasingly filtered and sometimes recycled the country has historically taken a progressive stance on environmental preservation in 1971 denmark established a ministry of environment and was the first country in the world to implement an environmental law in 1973 61 to mitigate environmental degradation and global warming the danish government has signed the climate change-kyoto protocol 62 however the national ecological footprint is 8.26 global hectares per person which is very high compared to a world average of 1.7 in 2010 63 contributing factors to this value are an exceptional high value for cropland but also a relatively high value for grazing land 64 which may be explained by the substantially high meat production in denmark  115.8 kilograms  255lb meat annually per capita and the large economic role of the meat and dairy industries 65 in december 2014 the climate change performance index for 2015 placed denmark at the top of the table explaining that although emissions are still quite high the country was able to implement effective climate protection policies 66 administrative divisionsedit denmark with a total area of 43,094 square kilometres  16,639sqmi is divided into five administrative regions danish regioner the regions are further subdivided into 98 municipalities kommuner the easternmost land in denmark the ertholmene archipelago with an area of 39 hectares  0.16 sq m is neither part of a municipality nor a region but belongs to the ministry of defence 67 the regions were created on 1 january 2007 to replace the sixteen former counties at the same time smaller municipalities were merged into larger units reducing the number from 270 most municipalities have a population of at least 20,000 to give them financial and professional sustainability although a few exceptions were made to this rule 68 the administrative divisions are led by directly elected councils elected proportionally every four years the most recent danish local elections were held on 19 november 2013 other regional structures use the municipal boundaries as a layout including the police districts the court districts and the electoral wards regionsedit the governing bodies of the regions are the regional councils with forty-one members elected for four-year terms the head of the council is the regional council chairman regionsrådsformand who is elected by the council 69 the areas of responsibility for the regional councils are the national health service social services and regional development 69 70 unlike the counties they replaced the regions are not allowed to levy taxes and the health service is primarily financed by a national health care contribution until 2018 sundhedsbidrag combined with funds from both government and municipalities 16 from 1 january 2019 this contribution will be abolished the area and populations of the regions vary widely for example the capital region which encompasses the copenhagen metropolitan area with the exception of the subtracted province east zeeland but includes the baltic sea island of bornholm has a population three times larger than that of north denmark region which covers the more sparsely populated area of northern jutland under the county system certain densely populated municipalities such as copenhagen municipality and frederiksberg had been given a status equivalent to that of counties making them first-level administrative divisions these sui generis municipalities were incorporated into the new regions under the 2007 reforms greenland and the faroe islandsedit the kingdom of denmark is a unitary state that comprises in addition to denmark proper two autonomous constituent countries in the north atlantic ocean greenland and the faroe islands they have been integrated parts of the danish realm since the 18th century however due to their separate historical and cultural identities these parts of the realm have extensive political powers and have assumed legislative and administrative responsibility in a substantial number of fields 71 the faroe islands gained home rule in 1948 and greenland in 1979 having previously had the status of counties 72 the two territories have their own home governments and parliaments and are effectively self-governing in regards to domestic affairs 72 high commissioners rigsombudsmand act as representatives of the danish government in the faroese løgting and in the greenlandic parliament but they cannot vote 72 the faroese home government is defined to be an equal partner with the danish national government 73 while the greenlandic people are defined as a separate people with the right to self-determination 74 politicsedit politics in denmark operates under a framework laid out in the constitution of denmarkn 11 first written in 1849 it establishes a sovereign state in the form of a constitutional monarchy with a representative parliamentary system the monarch officially retains executive power and presides over the council of state privy council 76 77 in practice the duties of the monarch are strictly representative and ceremonialn 12 78 such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the prime minister and other government ministers the monarch is not answerable for his or her actions and their person is sacrosanct 79 hereditary monarch queen margrethe ii has been head of state since 14 january 1972 governmentedit the danish parliament is called the folketing danish folketinget it is the legislature of the kingdom of denmark passing acts that apply in denmark and in limited cases greenland and the faroe islands the folketing is also responsible for adopting the states budgets approving the states accounts appointing and exercising control of the government and taking part in international cooperation bills may be initiated by the government or by members of parliament all bills passed must be presented before the council of state to receive royal assent within thirty days in order to become law 80 denmark is a representative democracy with universal suffragen 13 membership of the folketing is based on proportional representation of political parties 81 with a 2 electoral threshold danes elect 175 members to the folketing with greenland and the faroe islands electing an additional two members each—179 members in total 82 parliamentary elections are held at least every four years but it is within the powers of the prime minister to ask the monarch to call for an election before the term has elapsed on a vote of no confidence the folketing may force a single minister or the entire government to resign 83 the government of denmark operates as a cabinet government where executive authority is exercisedformally on behalf of the monarchby prime minister and other cabinet ministers who head ministries as the executive branch the cabinet is responsible for proposing bills and a budget executing the laws and guiding the foreign and internal policies of denmark the position of prime minister belongs to the person most likely to command the confidence of a majority in the folketing this is usually the current leader of the largest political party or more effectively through a coalition of parties a single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a cabinet on its own denmark has often been ruled by coalition governments themselves sometimes minority governments dependent on non-government parties 84 following a general election defeat in june 2015 helle thorning-schmidt leader of the social democrats socialdemokraterne resigned as prime minister she was succeeded by lars løkke rasmussen the leader of the liberal party venstre rasmussen heads a cabinet which unusually consists entirely of ministers from his own party law and judicial systemedit denmark has a civil law system with some references to germanic law denmark resembles norway and sweden in never having developed a case-law like that of england and the united states nor comprehensive codes like those of france and germany much of its law is customary 85 the judicial system of denmark is divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration articles sixty-two and sixty-four of the constitution ensure judicial independence from government and parliament by providing that judges shall only be guided by the law including acts statutes and practice 86 the kingdom of denmark does not have a single unified judicial system  denmark has one system greenland another and the faroe islands a third 87 however decisions by the highest courts in greenland and the faroe islands may be appealed to the danish high courts the danish supreme court is the highest civil and criminal court responsible for the administration of justice in the kingdom foreign relationsedit denmark wields considerable influence in northern europe and is a middle power in international affairs 88 in recent years greenland and the faroe islands have been guaranteed a say in foreign policy issues such as fishing whaling and geopolitical concerns the foreign policy of denmark is substantially influenced by its membership of the european union eu denmark joined the european economic community eec the eus predecessor in 1973n 14 denmark held the presidency of the council of the european union on seven occasions most recently from january to june 2012 89 following world war ii denmark ended its two-hundred-year-long policy of neutrality it has been a founding member of the north atlantic treaty organization nato since 1949 and membership remains highly popular 90 as a member of development assistance committee dac denmark has for a long time been among the countries of the world contributing the largest percentage of gross national income to development aid in 2015 denmark contributed 0.85 of its gross national income gni to foreign aid and was one of only six countries meeting the longstanding un target of 0.7 of gnin 15 91 the country participates in both bilateral and multilateral aid with the aid usually administered by the ministry of foreign affairs the organisational name of danish international development agency danida is often used in particular when operating bilateral aid militaryedit denmarks armed forces are known as the danish defence danish forsvaret the minister of defence is commander-in-chief of the danish defence and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad during peacetime the ministry of defence employs around 33,000 in total the main military branches employ almost 27,000 15,460 in the
