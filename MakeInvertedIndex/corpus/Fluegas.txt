flue gas flue gas is the gas exiting to the atmosphere via a flue which is a pipe or channel for conveying exhaust gases from a fireplace oven furnace boiler or steam generator quite often the flue gas refers to the combustion exhaust gas produced at power plants its composition depends on what is being burned but it will usually consist of mostly nitrogen typically more than two-thirds derived from the combustion of air carbon dioxide co2 and water vapor as well as excess oxygen also derived from the combustion air it further contains a small percentage of a number of pollutants such as particulate matter like soot carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides 1 scrubbingedit at power plants flue gas is often treated with a series of chemical processes and scrubbers which remove pollutants electrostatic precipitators or fabric filters remove particulate matter and flue-gas desulfurization captures the sulfur dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels particularly coal nitrogen oxides are treated either by modifications to the combustion process to prevent their formation or by high temperature or catalytic reaction with ammonia or urea in either case the aim is to produce nitrogen gas rather than nitrogen oxides in the united states there is a rapid deployment of technologies to remove mercury from flue gastypically by absorption on sorbents or by capture in inert solids as part of the flue-gas desulfurization product such scrubbing can lead to meaningful recovery of sulfur for further industrial use 2 technologies based on regenerative capture by amines for the removal of co2 from flue gas have been deployed to provide high purity co2 gas to the food industry and for enhanced oil recovery they are now under active research as a method for co2 capture for long-term storage as a means of greenhouse gas remediation and have begun to be implemented in a limited way commercially eg the sleipner west field in the north sea operating since 1996 3 there are a number of proven technologies for removing pollutants emitted from power plants that are now available there is also much ongoing research into technologies that will remove even more air pollutants 4 see alsoedit carbon capture and storage emission standard exhaust gas flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion flue gas stacks integrated gasification combined cycle often referred to as igcc landfill gas referencesedit v t e agricultural wastewater biodegradable waste brown waste chemical waste construction waste demolition waste electronic waste by country food waste green waste hazardous waste heat waste industrial waste litter marine debris biomedical waste mining waste municipal solid waste open defecation photodegradation post-consumer waste radioactive waste sewage toxic waste wastewater by country anaerobic digestion biodegradation composting garden waste dumping illegal dumping incineration landfill landfill mining mechanical biological treatment mechanical sorting open dump recycling resource recovery sewage treatment waste collection waste picking waste sorting waste trade waste treatment waste-to-energy armenia bangladesh brazil hong kong india new zealand russia switzerland uk usa bamako convention basel convention eu directives batteries landfills rohs framework incineration waste water weee london convention oslo convention ospar convention batteries landfills rohs framework incineration waste water weee blue ribbon commission on americas nuclear future cleaner production downcycling eco-industrial park extended producer responsibility high-level radioactive waste management history of waste management landfill fire sewage regulation and administration upcycling waste hierarchy waste legislation waste minimisation zero waste environment portal category commons concepts index journals lists organizations
