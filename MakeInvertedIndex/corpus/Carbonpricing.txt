tariff carbon diet food miles 2000-watt society carbon footprint v t e carbon pricing  the method favored by many economists for reducing global-warming emissions  charges those who emit carbon dioxide co2 for their emissions that charge called a carbon price is the amount that must be paid for the right to emit one tonne of co2 into the atmosphere 1 carbon pricing usually takes the form either of a carbon tax or a requirement to purchase permits to emit generally known as cap-and-trade but also called allowances carbon pricing solves the economic problem that co2 a known greenhouse gas is what economics calls a negative externality  a detrimental product that is not priced charged for by any market as a consequence of not being priced there is no market mechanism responsive to the costs of co2 emitted the standard economic solution to problems of this type first proposed by arthur pigou in 1920 is for the product - in this case co2 emissions - to be charged at a price equal to the monetary value of the damage caused by the emissions this should result in the economically optimal efficient amount of co2 emissions many practical concerns mar the theoretical simplicity of this picture for example the exact monetary damage caused by a tonne of co2 is uncertain the economics of carbon pricing is much the same for taxes and cap-and-trade both prices are efficienta they have the same social cost and the same effect on profits if permits are auctioned however some economists argue that caps prevent non-price policies such as renewable energy subsidies from reducing carbon emissions while carbon taxes do not others argue that an enforced cap is the only way to guarantee that carbon emissions will actually be reduced a carbon tax will not prevent those who can afford to do so from continuing to generate emissions the choice of pricing approach a tax or cap-and-trade has been controversial a carbon tax is generally favored on economic grounds for its simplicity and stability while cap-and-trade is often favored on political grounds recently  2013−14 economic opinion has been shifting more heavily toward taxes as national policy measures 2 and

nordhaus president of the american economic association published the climate casino 3 which culminates in a description of an international carbon price regime such a regime would require national commitments to a carbon price but not to a specific policy carbon taxes caps and hybrid schemes could all be used to satisfy such a commitment at the same time martin weitzman a leading climate economist at harvard published a theoretical study arguing that such a regime would make it far easier to reach an international agreement while a focus on national targets would continue to make it nearly impossible 4 nordhaus also makes this argument but less formally similar views have previously been discussed by joseph stiglitz 5 and have previously appeared in a number papers 6 the price-commitment view appears to have gained major support from independent positions taken by the world bank and the international monetary fund imf 7 on june 3 2014 the bank began circulating a statement 8 for countries and businesses to sign which advocated putting a price on carbon to reduce global warming it specifies that countries could use either emissions trading or carbon taxes to price carbon in march the imf published a factsheet 2 that advised using carbon taxes or similar and explained that cap-and-trade systems are another option in july 2014 they published getting energy prices right 9 which was promoted by christine lagarde head of the imf saying that the right prices would reduce carbon emissions by 23 percent 10b emission permits and carbon taxesedit the economists statement on climate change 11 was signed by over 2500 economists including nine nobel laureates in 1997 this statement summarizes the economic case for carbon pricing as follows in short this statement argues that carbon pricing either carbon taxes or the auction of emissions permitsc is a market mechanism in contrast to renewable subsidies or direct regulation of individual sources of carbon emissions and hence is the way that the united states and other nations can most efficiently implement their climate policies policies and commitmentsedit carbon prices can be determined by specific policies such as taxes or caps or by commitments such as emission reduction commitments or price commitments however emission reduction commitments used by the kyoto protocol can be met by non-price policies so they do not necessarily determine a carbon price carbon policiesedit carbon policies can be either price-based taxes or quantity-based cap-and-trade a cap-and-trade system is quantity-based because the regulator sets an emissions quantity cap and the market determines the carbon price carbon taxesedit a carbon tax is a price-based policy since the regulator sets the price directly in principle all sources of co2 emissions should be taxed at the same rate per ton of co2 emitted this can be accomplished by taxing all fossil fuel sources in proportion their carbon content in practice different fuels and different fuel uses may be taxed at quite different rates or not at all and the resulting tax may still be referred to as a carbon tax the resulting carbon price since it is directly regulated is generally more predictable than the price of emission permits under a cap-and-trade system as of july 2014 such carbon taxes exist in india japan south korea denmark finland france the republic of ireland the netherlands sweden the united kingdom norway switzerland costa rica parts of canada and parts of the united statescitation needed of course if all taxes on fossil fuels were counted the list would be much longer a carbon tax can be implemented locally nationally or by the eu parliament it cannot be implemented on a global scale because there is no government with that power however all countries could commit to a harmonized set of national carbon taxes joseph stiglitz william nordhaus and james hansen have been prominent proponents of carbon taxes cap and tradeedit a classic cap-and-trade design works in one of two ways first the government establishes an emissions cap for example 1000 tonsyear and prints 1000 permits to emit 1 ton then it either  1 gives the permits to stakeholders in some politically or administratively determined way or  2 auctions them off to the highest bidder after the permits have been distributed one way or the other they can be traded privately since emitters must have permits to cover their emissions or face a penalty that would cost more than buying permits emissions will be limited to the cap if the cap is low permits will be in short supply scarce and the price of permits will be high like a carbon tax a cap is generally applied to fossil fuel in proportion to its carbon content generally coverage is partial for example it may be limited to the electric industry the main difference between the two systems is that the market for permits automatically adjusts the carbon price to a level that insures that the cap is met while under a carbon tax the government and not the market sets the price of carbon 12 13 two or more countries can link their cap and trade markets simply by accepting carbon permits called allowances 14 from each other the effect of this is to equalize the price between the two markets this increases efficiency as of july 2014 cap and trade has been implement and not rescinded in new zealand 24 eu countries japan and parts of canada and the united states robert stavins 15 the european union emissions trading scheme and the environmental defense fund are some major proponents of cap and trade hybrid designsedit the imfs fact sheet states that cap-and-trade systems are another option but generally they should be designed to look like taxes through revenue-raising and price stability provisions 2 such designs are often referred to as hybrid designs the stability provisions referred to are typically floor and ceiling prices 16:47 a ceiling price is also known as a safety valve which are implemented as follows when permits are auctioned there is a floor reserve price below which permits are not sold and permits for immediate use are always made available at the ceiling price even if sales have already reached the permit cap to the extent the price is controlled by these limits it is a tax so if the floor is set equal to the ceiling cap-and-trade becomes a pure carbon tax revenue policiesedit as explained above and analyzed below cap-and-trade system can give away their permits for free or they can auction them in the later case they will have essentially the same revenues as a carbon tax these revenues can be distributed in various ways from a carbon-pricing perspective the distribution of revenues does not matter as long as the distribution is in no way related to carbon emission in other words no part of the collected carbon revenue can be returned to any party in proportion to the amount collected from that party to the extent that happens it negates the effect of the pricing policy standard proposals for using carbon revenues include return them to the public on a per-capita basisd use them in place of another tax a tax swap use them for energy research or use them to subsidize renewable energy projectse carbon commitmentsedit carbon commitments can be either price-based or quantity-based the kyoto protocol is based on a set of emission reduction commitments  quantity-based commitments these may or may not result in a carbon price depending on what policies countries choose when meeting these commitments in practice the eu ets cap-and-trade system resulted in a fairly strong carbon price but that was later undermined by renewables policies non-price policies as well as by the great recession more recently a number of prominent economists have proposed the use of price commitments to simplify international negotiations and to overcome the free-rider problem of climate change such commitments would require the use of pricing policies and would result in an efficient carbon price emission reduction commitmentsedit an emission reduction commitment sometimes called an emission target is a quantity-based commitment it differs from a cap because a country can emit more provided it buys carbon permits from another country that over-satisfies its commitment also such commitments need not lead to a price on carbon but can be met by non-price policies under the kyoto protocol annex i countries made emission reduction commitments these commitments did not specify which policy would be used to achieve them but the eu among others hoped that a set of linked national cap-and-trade markets would develop and that carbon pricing would be one of the most significant policies in achieving emission reductions in reality the eu ets and its carbon price did play an important role as did the more ambiguous pricing 17 of the clean development mechanism and its permits certified emission reduction units cers however renewables subsidies undermined the carbon price significantly as well as the efficiency of the emission reduction process the kyoto protocol also defined another carbon-pricing mechanism in the form of assigned amount units 18 aaus which were allocated to match countrys assigned amounts for most countries their 1990 emission levels minus their emission reduction commitments it also specified rules for trading these carbon credits trade of aaus takes place between countries and their price represents a carbon price faced by countries under the protocol however since businesses cannot purchase aaus that price has generally not been passed through to emitters emission reduction commitments have been implemented locally eg by the state of california nationally and by the eu parliament however these commitments are often largely aspirational and they do not have much to do with carbon pricing since they are often met mainly by non-price policies in the case of the kyoto protocol the result has been a constantly declining coverage of global carbon emissions down to about 21 in 2013 and an erratic and generally declining price of carbon a new quantity commitment approach suggested by mutsuyoshi nishimura is for all countries to commit to the same global emission target 19 the assembly of governments would issue permits in the amount of the global target and all upstream fossil-fuel providers would be forced to buy these permits all permits would be auctioned by the assembly which would also negotiate how to distribute the revenues such a set of commitments if kept would form a true quantity-based carbon pricing policy and result in an efficient uniform global carbon price however this would not necessarily be the correct price which would depend on the chosen global emission target how the revenues would be distributed would undoubtedly prove to be a contentious problem carbon price commitmentsedit as discussed above william nordhaus 3 joseph stiglitz 5 martin weitzman 4 stéphane dion 20 and others have proposed a global carbon price commitment as a way of achieving an efficient uniform carbon price and overcoming the negotiating problem inherent in national quantity targets the world bank is also organizing support for the idea that countries should commit to a carbon price and that such a price commitment could be met either be emission trading or carbon taxes economics of carbon pricingedit many economic properties of carbon pricing hold regardless of whether carbon is priced with a cap or a tax however there are a few important differences cap-based prices are more volatile and so they are riskier for investors consumers and for governments that auction permits also caps tend to short-out the effect of non-price policies such are renewables subsidies while carbon taxes do not efficiency of carbon pricingedit carbon pricing is considered by economists to be among the most efficient way to reduce emissions this means that it reduces emissions for the least possible cost where these costs include the cost of efficiency measures as well as the cost of the inconvenience of making do with less of the goods and services provided by fossil fuel this efficiency comes about by eliminating a market failure the un-priced external costs of carbon emissions at its source  by pricing these costs 21 this is best explained by example consider an example market with 100 emitters each of which gets a different benefit from using carbon and emitting co2 each emitter would like to use enough fossil fuel to emit 1 ton per year suppose the benefits from that ton range from $1 for the user with the least need for carbon to $100 in $1 increments for the user who would benefit most now consider this market under two different pricing policies a cap-and-trade policy and a tax further suppose that the tax is $60.01ton and the cap has been set at 40 tons so that 40 one-ton permits have been issued under the tax it is clear that no one with an emission value of less than $60.01 will emit because they would have to pay $60.01 for less than $60.01 in value so the 40 carbon users with values ranging from $61 to $100 will pay the tax and emit their ton of carbon under cap and trade suppose the price turned out be less than $60.01 and someone other than a top-40 emitter ranked by value got a permit in that case a top-40 emitter without a permit would offer that someone more than $60 and they would sell because that is more that the value they would get from using the permit themselves this will drive the price up to the point where only top-40 emitters get permits and the price is a little more say $60.01 than any bottom-60 emitter would pay several conclusions are drawn by economics from a somewhat more rigorous application of this type of analysis first the same people end up emitting under a tax and under a cap that pushes the price equally high second only the highest value emitters end up emitting third the total value of emitters is greater than under any other distribution of permits this final conclusion is the reason carbon pricing is considered efficient by economist finally economics points out that since regulators would have an extremely hard time finding out the value that each emitter receives from emittingf this efficient outcome is extremely unlikely if the regulator chooses who can emit and who cannot this is why economics teaches that command and control regulation will not be efficient and will be less efficient than a market mechanism such as carbon pricing in the words of the ipcc renewable energy subsidies are less efficient alternatives to carbon taxes and emissions trading for inducing mitigation section 3.8.1.2 16 interactions with renewable energy policiesedit cap-and-trade and carbon taxes interact differently with non-price policies such as renewable energy subsidies the ipcc explains this as follows consider the following hypothetical example of this effect suppose the price of permits in the eu would have been €30 and germany would have needed to purchase 20 million permits if germany then decided to subsidize investment in wind turbines that would not have been built with a €30 carbon price and they were built and operated then germany would need fewer permits hence the permits it would have used will go somewhere else perhaps to poland poland would then use them to emit more co2 perhaps by burning coal the result is that germany emits less co2 and this allows others to emit just as much more so the cap is met as it must be and the total co2 emitted is unchanged by the renewable subsidies and wind turbines notice that this same effect applies as well to an individual who chooses to buy an electric car under a cap-and-trade system the car emits less co2 so fewer permits are used up by this persons driving these permits will be bought by others and used so the same amount of co2 the cap will be emitted regardless of the purchase of the electric car it the buyers intent was to reduce carbon emissions the cap has thwarted their efforts by encouraging others to emit exactly as much as they abated their emissions as the ipcc noted a carbon tax does not have this effect cost pass-throughedit carbon pricing sometimes charges the emitter and sometimes charges the fossil fuel supplier fortunately the right person always ends up bearing the cost imposed by the policy the government may tax or cap an oil refinery based on all the carbon it buys in the form of oil but the refinery does not emit 90 of that carbon instead it makes gasoline and sells that to gas stations who sell it to drivers who emit the carbon in this case the refinery passes on the cost of its carbon permits or carbon tax just as it passes on all marginal costs and the gas stations pay those costs but then the gas stations pass on their cost to the drivers so drivers actually bear the cost of carbon pricing and that is as it should be because driving is the real reason for the emissions but economics does not view this as a moral matter rather economics points out that when the cost goes up if drivers do not find driving their suv for example worth the extra cost they will switch and drive their sports car ride their bike or join a car pool and that is the point of carbon pricing and if all alternative are unappealing that means the driver really is getting more benefit that the cost she is causing so again we have the right outcome  provided the carbon price equals the social cost free permits and windfall profitsedit as noted above under cap-and-trade the permits may be given away for free or auctioned in the first case the government receives no carbon revenue and in the second it receives on average the full value of the permits in either case permits will be equally scarce and just as valuable to market participants since the private market for trading permits determines the final price of permits at the time they must be used to cover emissions the price will be the same in either case free or auctioned this is generally understood a second point about free permits usually grandfathered ie given out in proportion to past emissions has often been misunderstood companies that receive free permits treat them as if they had paid full price for them this is because using carbon in production has the same cost under both arrangements with auctioned permits the cost is obvious with free permits the cost is the cost of not selling the permit at full value  this is termed an opportunity cost since the cost of emissions is generally a marginal cost increasing with output the cost is passed on by raising the cost of output eg raising the cost of gasoline or electricity windfall profits a company that receives permits for free will pass on its opportunity cost in the form of higher product prices hence if it sells the same amount of output as before that cap with no change in production technology the full value at the market price of permits received for free becomes windfall profits however since the cap reduces output and often causes the company to incur costs to increase efficiency windfall profits will be less than the full value of its free permits 23 generally speaking if permits are allocated to emitters for free they will profit from them but if they must pay full price or if carbon it taxed their profits will be reduced if the carbon price exactly equals the true social cost of carbon then long-run profit reduction will simply reflect the consequences of paying this new costg if having to pay this cost is unexpected then there will likely be a one-time loss that is due to the change in regulations and not simply due to paying the real cost of carbon however it there is advanced notice of this change or if the carbon price is introduced gradually this one-time regulatory cost will be minimized there has now been enough advance notice of carbon pricing that this effect should be negligible on average the cost of carbon pricingedit there has been much controversy over the cost to society or dead-weight loss of carbon pricing generally the cost though substantial is much less than imagined an example will illustrate suppose a $30 carbon price is imposed on the roughly 5 billion tonnes of co2 the us emits each year and suppose that causes emissions to drop 25 in the long run to 4 billion tonnes how much does that cost the us excluding the benefit of the reduced externality there are two simplistic views that are sometimes taken and these bracket the correct answer which is $15 billion per year first if permits are auctioned a cap or tax will each collect $30  4 billion  $120 billionyear so that is sometimes said to be the cost of the policy second if the permits are given away or the tax is refunded then it may appear that there is no cost at all in fact the two situations are not so different because carbon revenues do not vanish so they are not a cost revenues only become a cost if they are entirely wasted but that would not be the fault of pricing carbon however the view that the cost is zero must be wrong as well in fact the real social cost is not related to the revenues at all but is determined by what physically happens in the economy what happens is that people take certain actions to reduce emissions in this example those actions reduce emissions by 1 billion tons per year but no one would deliberately pay more than $30 to avoid emitting a tonne since it would be cheaper to pay the price of carbon but without the carbon price very cheap abatements should be available but these are ignored because they cost a bit more than the energy they save these cheap abatements can have net abatement costsh down to essentially zero so all abatement should range in cost between $0 and $30tonne the typical assumption is that marginal abatement costs increase linearly so the standard assumption is that the average cost of abatement will be half the marginal cost or $15tonne 24 so that will be the average cost of the 1 billion tonnes per years that is abated for a total cost of $15 billion per year emissions trading further discussionedit besides cap and trade emission trading can refer to project-based programs also referred to as a credit or offset programs such programs can sell credits for emission reductions provided by approved projects generally there is an additionality 17 requirement that states that they must reduce emissions more than is required by pre-existing regulation an example of such a program is the clean development mechanism under the kyoto protocol these credits can be traded to other facilities where they can be used for compliance with a cap-and-trade program 25 unfortunately the concept of additionality is difficult to define and monitor with the result that some companies purposefully increasing emissions in order to get paid to eliminate them 26 cap-and-trade programs often allow banking of permits this means that permits can be saved and can be used in the future this allows an entity to over-comply in early periods in anticipation of higher carbon prices in subsequent years 27 this helps to stabilize the price of permits 12 on january 1 2005 the european union introduced the eu emissions trading system eu ets for electricity plants and several branches of industry the eu ets sets targets for the co2 emissions of some 11,500 plants across the eu-25 installations have the flexibility to increase emissions above their targets provided that they acquire emission allowances to cover those emissions while electric plants with emissions below caps are allowed to sell unused allowances see alsoedit global warming portal economics portal carbon pricing in australia economics of climate change mitigation external linksedit carbon tax carbon tax center  argues for a
