air conditioning air conditioning often referred to as ac ac or ac is the process of removing heat from a confined space thus cooling the air and removing humidity this process is used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment typically for humans or animals however air conditioners are also used to cool rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices such as computer servers or power amplifiers air conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an occupied space such as a building or a car to improve thermal comfort and indoor air quality electric refrigerant-based ac units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom which can be carried by a single adult to massive units installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building the cooling is typically achieved through a refrigeration cycle but sometimes evaporation or free cooling is used air conditioning systems can also be made based on desiccants chemicals which remove moisture from the air 1 in the most general sense air conditioning can refer to any form of technology that modifies the condition of air heating cooling de-humidification cleaning ventilation or air movement in common usage though air conditioning refers to systems which cool air in construction a complete system of heating ventilation and air conditioning is referred to as heating

since prehistoric times snow and ice were used for cooling the business of harvesting ice during winter and storing for use in summer became popular towards the late 17th century 3 this practice was replaced by mechanical ice-making machines the basic concept behind air conditioning is said to have been applied in ancient egypt where reeds were hung in windows and were moistened with trickling water the evaporation of water cooled the air blowing through the window this process also made the air more humid which can be beneficial in a dry desert climate in ancient rome water from aqueducts was circulated through the walls of certain houses to cool them other techniques in medieval persia involved the use of cisterns and wind towers to cool buildings during the hot season 4 the 2nd-century chinese inventor ding huan fl 180 of the han dynasty invented a rotary fan for air conditioning with seven wheels 3m  10ft in diameter and manually powered by prisoners of the time 5 in 747 emperor xuanzong r 712–762 of the tang dynasty  618–907 had the cool hall liang tian built in the imperial palace which the tang yulin describes as having water-powered fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains during the subsequent song dynasty  960–1279 written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used 6 in the 17th century cornelis drebbel demonstrated turning summer into winter for james i of england by adding salt to water 7 development of mechanical coolingedit modern air conditioning emerged from advances in chemistry during the 19th century and the first large-scale electrical air conditioning was invented and used in 1902 by american inventor willis carrier the introduction of residential air conditioning in the 1920s helped enable the great migration to the sun belt in the united states in 1758 benjamin franklin and john hadley a chemistry professor at cambridge university conducted an experiment to explore the principle of evaporation as a means to rapidly cool an object franklin and hadley confirmed that evaporation of highly volatile liquids such as alcohol and ether could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water they conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to speed-up the evaporation they lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to −14c  7f while the ambient temperature was 18c  64f franklin noted that soon after they passed the freezing point of water 0c  32f a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometers bulb and that the ice mass was about 6mm  1⁄4in thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching −14c  7f franklin concluded from this experiment one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summers day 8 in 1820 english scientist and inventor michael faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate in 1842 florida physician john gorrie used compressor technology to create ice which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in apalachicola florida he hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings he even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine improved process for the artificial production of ice his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine according to his biographer vivian m sherlock he blamed the ice king frederic tudor for his failure suspecting that tudor had launched a smear campaign against his invention dr gorrie died impoverished in 1855 and the idea of air conditioning went away for 50 years james harrisons first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the barwon river at rocky point in geelong australia his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853 and his patent for an ether vapor compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855 this novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser where it cooled down and liquefied the liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again cooling down the surrounding system the machine employed a flywheel and produced 3,000 kilograms of ice per day though harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in sydney in 1860 he later entered the debate over how to compete against the american advantage of unrefrigerated beef sales to the united kingdom he wrote fresh meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship norfolk for an experimental beef shipment to the united kingdom his choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected electromechanical coolingedit in 1902 the first modern electrical air conditioning unit was invented by willis carrier in buffalo new york after graduating from cornell university carrier found a job at the buffalo forge company while there he began experimenting with air conditioning as a way to solve an application problem for the sackett-wilhelms lithographing and publishing company in brooklyn new york the first air conditioner designed and built in buffalo by carrier began working on 17 july 1902 designed to improve manufacturing process control in a printing plant carriers invention controlled not only temperature but also humidity carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process instead of sending air through hot coils he sent it through cold coils filled with cold water the air was cooled and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable the controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment later carriers technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace and the carrier air conditioning company of america was formed to meet rising demand over time air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and automobiles as well residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s in 1906 stuart w cramer of charlotte north carolina was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill cramer coined the term air conditioning using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to water conditioning then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process he combined moisture with ventilation to condition and change the air in the factories controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants willis carrier adopted the term and incorporated it into the name of his companycitation needed shortly thereafter the first private home to have air conditioning was built in minneapolis in 1914 owned by charles gates 9 realizing that air conditioning would one day be a standard feature of private homes particularly in regions with warmer climate david st pierre dubose  1898-1994 designed a network of ductwork and vents for his home meadowmont all disguised behind intricate and attractive georgian-style open moldingswhen this building is believed to be one of the first private homes in the united states equipped for central air conditioning 10 in 1945 robert sherman of lynn massachusetts invented a portable in-window air conditioner that cooled heated humidified dehumidified and filtered the air 11 refrigerant developmentedit the first air conditioners and refrigerators employed toxic or flammable gases such as ammonia methyl chloride or propane that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked thomas midgley jr created the first non-flammable non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas freon in 1928 the name is a trademark name owned by dupont for any chlorofluorocarbon cfc hydrochlorofluorocarbon hcfc or hydrofluorocarbon hfc refrigerant the refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition eg r-11 r-12 r-22 r-134a the blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an hcfc known as chlorodifluoromethane r-22 dichlorodifluoromethane r-12 was the most common blend used in automobiles in the us until 1994 when most designs changed to r-134a due to the ozone-depleting potential of r-12 r-11 and r-12 are no longer manufactured in the us for this type of application so the only source for air-conditioning repair purposes is the cleaned and purified gas recovered from other air conditioner systems several non-ozone-depleting refrigerants have been developed as alternatives including r-410a it was first commercially used by carrier corp under the brand name puron modern refrigerants have been developed to be more environmentally safe than many of the early chlorofluorocarbon-based refrigerants used in the early- and mid-twentieth century these include hcfcs r-22 as used in most us homes even before 2011 and hfcs r-134a used in most cars have replaced most cfc use hcfcs in turn are supposed to have been in the process of being phased out under the montreal protocol and replaced by hfcs such as r-410a which lack chlorinecitation needed hfcs however contribute to climate change problems moreover policy and political influence by corporate executives resisted change 12 13 corporations insisted that no alternatives to hfcs existed the environmental organization greenpeace solicited a european laboratory to research an alternative ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant in 1992 gained patent rights to a hydrocarbon mix of isopentane and isobutane but then left the technology as open access 14 15 their activist marketing first in germany led to companies like whirlpool bosch and later lg and others to incorporate the technology throughout europe then asia although the corporate executives resisted in latin america so that it arrived in argentina produced by a domestic firm in 2003 and then finally with giant boschs production in brazil by 2004 16 17 in 1995 germany made cfc refrigerators illegal 18 dupont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the us with the us epa disparaging the approach as that german technology 17 19 nevertheless in 2004 greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like coca-cola and unilever and later pepsico and others to create a corporate coalition called refrigerants naturally 18 20 then four years later ben  jerrys of unilever and general electric began to take steps to support production and use in the us 21 only in 2011 did the epa finally decide in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for us manufacture 14 22 23 operating principlesedit refrigeration cycleedit in the refrigeration cycle heat is transported from a colder location to a hotter area as heat would naturally flow in the opposite direction work is required to achieve this a refrigerator is an example of such a system as it transports the heat out of the interior and into its environment the refrigerant is used as the medium which absorbs and removes heat from the space to be cooled and subsequently rejects that heat elsewhere circulating refrigerant vapor enters the compressor where its pressure and temperature are increased the hot compressed refrigerant vapor is now at a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed and is routed through a condenser here it is cooled by air flowing across the condenser coils and condensed into a liquid thus the circulating refrigerant removes heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air the removal of this heat can be greatly augmented by pouring water over the condenser coils making it much cooler when it hits the expansion valve the condensed pressurized and still usually somewhat hot liquid refrigerant is next routed through an expansion valve often nothing more than a pinhole in the systems copper tubing where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure that pressure reduction results in flash evaporation of a part of the liquid refrigerant greatly lowering its temperature the cold refrigerant is then routed through the evaporator a fan blows the interior warm air which is to be cooled across the evaporator causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well further lowering the temperature the warm air is therefore cooled and is pumped by an exhaust fan blower into the room to complete the refrigeration cycle the refrigerant vapor is routed back into the compressor in order for the process to have any efficiency the cooling evaporative portion of the system must be separated by some kind of physical barrier from the heating condensing portion and each portion must have its own fan to circulate its own kind of air either the hot air or the cool air modern air conditioning systems are not designed to draw air into the room from the outside they only recirculate the increasingly cool air on the inside because this inside air always has some amount of moisture suspended in it the cooling portion of the process always causes ambient warm water vapor to condense on the cooling coils and to drip from them down onto a catch tray at the bottom of the unit from which it must then be routed outside usually through a drain hole as this moisture has no dissolved minerals in it it never causes mineral buildup on the coils though if the unit is set at its strongest cooling setting and happens to have inadequate circulation of air through the coils and also experiences a failure of the thermistor which senses the ambient temperature in the room the coils fins can develop a layer of ice which will then grow and eventually block the circulation of air on the cool side of the unit altogether in a positive feedback loop that will cause the formation of an ice block inside the unit only minuscule amounts of cool air will then manage to come from the exhaust vent until this ice is removed or is allowed to melt this will happen even if the ambient humidity level is low once ice begins to form on the evaporative fins it will reduce circulation efficiency and cause the development of more ice etc a clean and strong circulatory fan can help prevent this as will raising the target cool temperature of the units thermostat to a point that the compressor is allowed to turn off occasionally a failing thermistor may also cause this problem this is the same issue faced by refrigerators that do not have a defrost cycle dust can also cause the fins to begin blocking air flow with the same undesirable result ice by running an air conditioners compressor in the opposite direction the overall effect can be completely reversed and the indoor compartment will become heated instead of cooled see heat pump the engineering of physical and thermodynamic properties of gasvapor mixtures is called psychrometrics heat pump unitedit a heat pump is an air conditioner in which the refrigeration cycle can be reversed producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment they are also commonly referred to as a reverse cycle air conditioner the heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating some homeowners elect to have a heat pump system installed as a feature of a central air conditioner when the heat pump is in heating mode the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil producing heat the outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator and discharges cold air colder than the ambient outdoor air air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 40–55f  4–13c because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold this is because ice forms on the outdoor units heat exchanger coil which blocks air flow over the coil to compensate for this the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil so that it can heat up and defrost a heat pump system will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter the icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating such as a natural gas or oil furnace which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures in this case the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower absorption heat pumps are a kind of air-source heat pump but they do not depend on electricity to power them instead gas solar power or heated water is used as a main power source an absorption pump dissolves ammonia gas in water which gives off heat next the water and ammonia mixture is depressurized to induce boiling and the ammonia is boiled off which absorbs heat from the outdoor aircitation needed some more expensive window air conditioning units have a true heat pump function however a window unit may only have an electric resistance heater evaporative coolingedit in very dry climates evaporative coolers sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers are popular for improving coolness during hot weather an evaporative cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad such as a large sponge soaked with water the sensible heat of the incoming air as measured by a dry bulb thermometer is reduced the temperature of the incoming air is reduced but it is also more humid so the total heat sensible heat plus latent heat is unchanged some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads if the entering air is dry enough the results can be quite substantial evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants unlike other types of air conditioners evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window 24 these coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain free coolingedit air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant typically water or a glycol mix from a cold source which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space common storage media are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes equipped with heat exchanger some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems using free cooling early in the cooling season and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage the heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season thereby declining its effectiveness free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage stes so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning free cooling and hybrid systems are mature technology 25 humidity controledit since humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the evaporation of perspiration from the skin drier air up to a point improves the comfort provided the comfort air conditioner is designed to create a 50 to 60 relative humidity in the occupied space dehumidification and coolingedit refrigeration air conditioning equipment usually reduces the absolute humidity of the air processed by the system the relatively cold below the dewpoint evaporator coil condenses water vapor from the processed air much like an ice-cold drink will condense water on the outside of a glass therefore water vapor is removed from the cooled air and the relative humidity in the room is lowered the water is usually sent to a drain or may simply drip onto the ground outdoors the heat is rejected by the condenser which is located outside of room to be cooled dehumidification onlyedit a specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier it also uses a refrigeration cycle but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside however since all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room no heat energy is removed instead the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat so the room is actually heated just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power in addition if water is condensed in the room the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room the latent heat of vaporization the dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an evaporative cooler and instead releases heat therefore an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water inside the unit the air passes over the evaporator coil first and is cooled and dehumidified the now dehumidified cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again then the air is released back into the room the unit produces warm dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment room that is to be conditioned dehumidifiers are commonly used in cold damp climates to prevent mold growth indoors especially in basements they are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in tropical countries energy transferedit in a thermodynamically closed system any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase this increase has the effect that for each unit of energy input into the system say to power a light bulb in the closed system the air conditioner removes that energy 26 in order to do so the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its efficiency coefficient of performance times the amount of power dissipated into the system as an example assume that inside the closed system a 100w heating element is activated and the air conditioner has an coefficient of performance of 200 the air conditioners power consumption will increase by 50w to compensate for this thus making the 100w heating element cost a total of 150w of power it is typical for air conditioners to operate at efficiencies of significantly greater than 100 27 however it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality lower entropy than the output thermal energy heat energy air conditioner equipment power in the us is often described in terms of tons of refrigeration a ton of refrigeration is approximately equal to the cooling power of one short ton  2000 pounds or 907 kilograms of ice melting in a 24-hour period the value is defined as 12,000 btu per hour or 3517 watts 28 residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons  3 to 20 kilowatts kw in capacity seasonal energy efficiency ratioedit for residential homes some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency in the united states the efficiency of air conditioners is often but not always rated by the seasonal energy efficiency ratio seer the higher the seer rating the more energy efficient is the air conditioner the seer rating is the btu of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in watt hours wh during the same period 29 this can also be rewritten as for example a 5000 btuh air-conditioning unit with a seer of 10 would consume 5000/10  500 watts of power on average the electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time assuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season ie 8 hours per day for 125 days per year another method that yields the same result is to calculate the total annual cooling output then for a seer of 10 the annual electrical energy usage would be seer is related to the coefficient of performance cop commonly used in thermodynamics and also to the energy efficiency ratio eer the eer is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures while seer is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures ie the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the seer test seer is unusual in that it is composed of an imperial unit divided by an si unit the cop is a ratio with the same metric units of energy joules in both the numerator and denominator they cancel out leaving a dimensionless quantity formulas for the approximate conversion between seer and eer or cop are available from the pacific gas and electric company 30 from equation  2 above a seer of 13 is equivalent to a cop of 3.43 which means that 3.43 units of heat energy are pumped per unit of work energy the united states now requires that residential systems manufactured in 2006 have a minimum seer rating of 13 although window-box systems are exempt from this law so their seer is still around 10 installation typesedit window unit and packaged terminaledit window unit air conditioners are installed in an open window the interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator on the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser a large house or building may have several such units allowing each room to be cooled separately packaged terminal air conditioner ptac systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systemscitation needed they are ductless systems ptacs which are frequently used in hotels have two separate units terminal packages the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them this minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently ptac systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather either directly by using an electric strip gas or other heater or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air converting the air conditioner into a heat pump while room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning the first practical through-the-wall air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at chrysler motors and offered for sale starting in 1935 31 split systemsedit split-system air conditioners come in two forms mini-split and central systems in both types the inside-environment evaporative heat exchanger is separated by some distance from the outside-environment condensing unit heat exchanger mini-split ductless systemedit a mini-split system typically supplies air conditioned and heated air to a single or a few rooms of a building 32 mutli-zone systems are a common application of ductless systems and allow up to 8 rooms zones to be conditioned from a single outdoor unit multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted ceiling-mounted ceiling recessed and horizontal ducted mini-split systems typically produce 9,000to 36,000btu  9,500–38,000kj per hour of cooling multi-zone systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 btus advantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms the inside wall space required is significantly reduced also the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a ptac or window air conditioner flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior ones these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof in addition ductless systems offer higher efficiency reaching above 30 seer 33 the primary disadvantage of ductless air conditioners is their cost such systems cost about us$1,500 to us$2,000 per ton  12,000 btu per hour of cooling capacity this is about 30 more than central systems not including ductwork and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity 34 an additional possible disadvantage that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems although lower operating costs and rebates or other financial incentivesoffered in some areascan help offset the initial expense 35 central ducted air conditioningedit central ducted air conditioning offers whole-house or large-commercial-space cooling and often offers moderate multi-zone temperature control capability by the addition of air-louver-control boxes in central air conditioning the inside heat-exchanger is typically placed inside the central furnaceac unit of the forced air heating system which is then used in the summer to distribute chilled air throughout a residence or commercial building portable unitsedit a portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office they are currently available with capacities of about 5,000–60,000btuh  1,500–18,000w and with or without electric-resistance heaters portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative the compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled meaning they use air to exchange heat in the same way as a car or typical household air conditioner does such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it it collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air portable split systemedit a portable system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes similar to a permanently fixed installed unit portable hose systemedit hose systems which can be monoblock or air-to-air are vented to the outside via air ducts the monoblock type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full the air-to-air type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously a single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser and then vents it outside this air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms due to the negative pressure inside the room thus reducing the units effectiveness 36 modern units might have a coefficient of performance of approximately 3 ie 1kw of electricity will produce 3kw of cooling a dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room and thus is more effective than most single-hose units portable evaporative systemedit evaporative coolers sometimes called swamp coolers do not have a compressor or condenser liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins releasing the vapor into the cooled area evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat the latent heat of vaporisation cooling the air humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by sweating evaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area making them truly portable they are also very cheap to install and use less energy than refrigerative air conditioners usesedit air-conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into comfort and process applications comfort applicationsedit comfort applications aim to provide a building indoor environment that remains relatively constant despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads air conditioning makes deep plan buildings feasible for otherwise they would have to be built narrower or with light wells so that inner spaces received sufficient outdoor air via natural ventilation air conditioning also allows buildings to be taller since wind speed increases significantly with altitude making natural ventilation impractical for very tall buildingscitation needed comfort applications are quite different for various building types and may be categorized as commercial buildings which are built for commerce including offices malls shopping centers restaurants etc high-rise residential buildings such as tall dormitories and apartment blocks industrial spaces where thermal comfort of workers is desired institutional buildings which includes government buildings hospitals schools etc low-rise residential buildings including single-family houses duplexes and small apartment buildings sports stadiums such as the university of phoenix stadium 37 and in qatar for the 2022 fifa world cup 38 women have on average a significantly lower resting metabolic rate than men 39 using inaccurate metabolic rate guidelines for air conditioning sizing can result in oversized and less efficient equipment 39 and setting system operating setpoints too cold can result in reduced worker productivity 40 in addition to buildings air conditioning can be used for many types of transportation including automobiles buses and other land vehicles trains ships aircraft and spacecraft domestic usageedit air conditioning is common in the us with 88 of new single-family homes constructed in 2011 including air conditioning ranging from 99 in the south to 62 in the west 41 in canada air conditioning use varies by province in 2013 55 of canadian households reported having an air conditioner with high use in manitoba  80 ontario  78 saskatchewan  67 and quebec  54 and lower use in prince edward island  23 british columbia  21 and newfoundland and labrador  9 42 in europe home air conditioning is generally less common southern european countries such as greece have seen a wide proliferation of home air-conditioning units in recent years 43 in another southern european country malta it is estimated that around 55 of households have an air conditioner installed 44 in india ac sales have dropped by 40 clarification needed due to higher costs and stricter energy efficiency regulations 45 process applicationsedit process applications aim to provide a suitable environment for a process being carried out regardless of internal heat and humidity loads and external weather conditions it is the needs of the process that determine conditions not human preference process applications include these chemical and biological laboratories cleanrooms for the production of integrated circuits pharmaceuticals and the like in which very high levels of air cleanliness and control of temperature and humidity are required for the success of the process environmental control of data centers facilities for breeding laboratory animals since many animals normally reproduce only in spring holding them in rooms in which conditions mirror those of spring all year can cause them to reproduce year-round food cooking and processing areas hospital operating theatres in which air is filtered to high levels to reduce infection risk and the humidity controlled to limit patient dehydration although temperatures are often in the comfort range some specialist procedures such as open heart surgery require low temperatures about 18c 64f and others such as neonatal relatively high temperatures about 28c 82f industrial environments mining nuclear power facilities physical testing facilities plants and farm growing areas textile manufacturing in both comfort and process applications the objective may be to not only control temperature but also humidity air quality and air movement from space to space health effectsedit air-conditioning systems can promote the growth and spread of microorganisms 46 such as legionella pneumophila the infectious agent responsible for legionnaires disease or thermophilic actinomycetes however this is only prevalent in poorly maintained water cooling towers as long as the cooling tower is kept clean usually by means of a chlorine treatment these health hazards can be avoided or reduced conversely air conditioning including filtration humidification cooling and disinfection can be used to provide a clean safe hypoallergenic atmosphere in hospital operating rooms and other environments where proper atmosphere is critical to patient safety and well-being excessive air conditioning can have a negative effect on skin causing it to dry out 47 and can also cause dehydration 48 environmental impactsedit power consumptionedit innovation in air conditioning technologies continues with much recent emphasis placed on energy efficiency production of the electricity used to operate air conditioners has an environmental impact including the release of greenhouse gases cylinder unloaders are a method of load control used mainly in commercial air conditioning systems on a semi-hermetic or open compressor the heads can be fitted with unloaders which remove a portion of the load from the compressor so that it can run better when full cooling is not needed unloaders can be electrical or mechanical in an automobile the ac system will use around 4 horsepower  3kw of the engines power thus increasing fuel consumption of the vehicle 49 refrigerantsedit most refrigerants used for air conditioning contribute to global warming and many also deplete the ozone layer 50 cfcs hcfcs and hfcs are potent greenhouse gases when leaked to the atmosphere the use of cfc as a refrigerant was once common being used in the refrigerants r-11 and r-12 sold under the brand name freon-12 freon refrigerants were commonly used during the 20th century in air conditioners due to their superior stability and safety properties however these chlorine-bearing refrigerants reach the upper atmosphere when they escape 51 once the refrigerant reaches the stratosphere uv radiation from the sun homolytically cleaves the chlorine-carbon bond yielding a chlorine radical these chlorine radicals catalyze the breakdown of ozone into diatomic oxygen depleting the ozone layer that shields the earths surface from strong uv radiation each chlorine radical remains active as a catalyst until it binds with another radical forming a stable molecule and breaking the chain reaction prior to 1994 most automotive air conditioning systems used r-12 as a refrigerant it was replaced with r-134a refrigerant which has no ozone depletion potential old r-12 systems can be retrofitted to r-134a by a complete flush and filterdryer replacement to remove the mineral oil which is not compatible with r-134a r22 also known as hcfc-22 has a global warming potential about 1,800 times higher than co2 52 it was phased out for use in new equipment by 2010 and is to be completely discontinued by 2020 although these gasses can be recycled when air conditioning units are disposed of uncontrolled dumping and leaking can release gas directly into the atmosphere in the uk the ozone regulations 53 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting hcfc refrigerants such as r22 in new systems the regulation banned the use of r22 as a top-up fluid for maintenance between 2010 for virgin fluid and 2015 for recycled fluid this means that equipment that uses r22 can still operate as long as it does not leak although r22 is now banned units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained 54 the manufacture and use of cfcs has been banned or severely restricted due to concerns about ozone depletion see also montreal protocol 55 56 in light of these environmental concerns beginning on november 14 1994 the us environmental protection agency has restricted the sale possession and use of refrigerant to only licensed technicians per rules under sections 608 and 609 of the clean air act 57 as an alternative to conventional refrigerants other gases such as co2 r-744 have been proposed 58 r-744 is being adopted as a refrigerant in europe and japan it is an effective refrigerant with a global warming potential of 1 but it must use higher compression to produce an equivalent cooling effectcitation needed in 1992 a non-governmental organization greenpeace was spurred by corporate executive policies and requested that a european lab find substitute refrigerants this led to two alternatives one a blend of propane r290 and isobutane r600a and one of pure isobutane 15 18 industry resisted change in europe until 1993 and in the us until 2011 despite some supportive steps in
