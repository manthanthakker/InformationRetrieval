appropriate technology appropriate technology is an ideological movement and its manifestations encompassing technological choice and application that is small-scale decentralized labor-intensive energy-efficient environmentally sound and locally autonomous 1 it was originally articulated as intermediate technology by the economist dr ernst friedrich fritz schumacher in his work small is beautiful both schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasize the technology as people-centered 2 appropriate technology has been used to address issues in a wide range of fields well-known examples of appropriate technology applications include bike- and hand-powered water pumps and other self-powered equipment the universal nut sheller self-contained solar lamps and streetlights and passive solar building designs today appropriate technology is often developed using open source principles which have led to open-source appropriate technology osat and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the internet 3 4 osat has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for sustainable development 5 6 appropriate technology is most commonly discussed in its relationship to economic development and as an alternative to technology transfer of more capital-intensive technology from industrialized nations to developing countries 2 7 however appropriate technology movements can be found in both developing and developed countries in developed countries the appropriate technology movement grew out of the energy crisis of the 1970s and focuses mainly on environmental and sustainability issues 8 today the idea is multifaceted in some contexts appropriate technology can be described as the simplest level of technology that can achieve the intended purpose whereas in others it can refer to engineering that takes adequate consideration of social and environmental ramifications the facets are connected through robustness and sustainable living  contents 1 background 1.1 history 1.1.1 predecessors 1.1.2 e f schumacher 1.1.3 growing trend 1.1.4 decline 1.1.5 potential resurgence 1.2 terminology 1.3

technology a combination of the greek technÄ“ art craft with logos word speech meant in greece a discourse on the arts both fine and applied when it first appeared in english in the 17th century it was used to mean a discussion of the applied arts only and gradually these arts themselves came to be the object of the designation by the early 20th century the term embraced a growing range of means processes and ideas in addition to tools and machines by mid-century technology was defined by such phrases as the means or activity by which man seeks to change or manipulate his environment even such broad definitions have been criticized by observers who point out the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between scientific inquiry and technological activity a highly compressed account of the history of technology such as this one must adopt a rigorous methodological pattern if it is to do justice to the subject without grossly distorting it one way or another the plan followed in the present article is primarily chronological tracing the development of technology through phases that succeed each other in time obviously the division between phases is to a large extent arbitrary one factor in the weighting has been the enormous acceleration of western technological development in recent centuries eastern technology is considered in this article in the main only as it relates to the development of modern technology predecessorsedit indian ideological leader mahatma gandhi is often cited as the father of the appropriate technology movement though the concept had not been given a name gandhi advocated for small local and predominantly village-based technology to help indias villages become self-reliant he disagreed with the idea of technology that benefited a minority of people at the expense of the majority or that put people out of work to increase profit 2 in 1925 gandhi founded the all-india spinners association and in 1935 he retired from politics to form the all-india village industries association both organizations focused on village-based technology similar to the future appropriate technology movement 9 china also implemented policies similar to appropriate technology during the reign of mao zedong and the following cultural revolution during the cultural revolution development policies based on the idea of walking on two legs advocated the development of both large-scale factories and small-scale village industries 2 e f schumacheredit despite these early examples dr ernst friedrich fritz schumacher is credited as the founder of the appropriate technology movement a well-known economist schumacher worked for the british national coal board for more than 20 years where he blamed the size of the industrys operations for its uncaring response to the harm black-lung disease inflicted on the miners 2 however it was his work with developing countries such as india and burma which helped schumacher form the underlying principles of appropriate technology schumacher first articulated the idea of intermediate technology now known as appropriate technology in a 1962 report to the indian planning commission in which he described india as long in labor and short in capital calling for an intermediate industrial technology 10 that harnessed indias labor surplus schumacher had been developing the idea of intermediate technology for several years prior to the planning commission report in 1955 following a stint as an economic advisor to the government of burma he published the short paper economics in a buddhist country his first known critique of the effects of western economics on developing countries 10 in addition to buddhism schumacher also credited his ideas to gandhi initially schumachers ideas were rejected by both the indian government and leading development economists spurred to action over concern the idea of intermediate technology would languish schumacher george mcrobie mansur hoda 11 and julia porter brought together a group of approximately 20 people to form the intermediate technology development group itdg in may 1965 later that year a schumacher article published in the observer garnered significant attention and support for the group in 1967 the group published the tools for progress a guide to small-scale equipment for rural development and sold 7,000 copies itdg also formed panels of experts and practitioners around specific technological needs such as building construction energy and water to develop intermediate technologies to address those needs 10 at a conference hosted by the itdg in 1968 the term intermediate technology was discarded in favor of the term appropriate technology used today intermediate technology had been criticized as suggesting the technology was inferior to advanced or high technology and not including the social and political factors included in the concept put forth by the proponents 2 in 1973 schumacher described the concept of appropriate technology to a mass audience in his influential work small is beautiful economics as if people mattered growing trendedit between 1966 and 1975 the number of new appropriate technology organizations founded each year was three times greater than the previous nine years there was also an increase in organizations focusing on applying appropriate technology to the problems of industrialized nations particularly issues related to energy and the environment 12 in 1977 the oecd identified in its appropriate technology directory 680 organizations involved in the development and promotion of appropriate technology by 1980 this number had grown to more than 1,000 international agencies and government departments were also emerging as major innovators in appropriate technology indicating its progression from a small movement fighting against the established norms to a legitimate technological choice supported by the establishment for example the inter-american development bank created a committee for the application of intermediate technology in 1976 and the world health organization established the appropriate technology for health program in 1977 12 appropriate technology was also increasingly applied in developed countries for example the energy crisis of the mid-1970s led to the creation of the national center for appropriate technology ncat in 1977 with an initial appropriation of 3 million dollars from the us congress the center sponsored appropriate technology demonstrations to help low-income communities find better ways to do things that will improve the quality of life and that will be doable with the skills and resources at hand however by 1981 the ncats funding agency community services administration had been abolished for several decades ncat worked with the us departments of energy and agriculture on contract to develop appropriate technology programs since 2005 ncats informational web site is no longer funded by the us government 13 declineedit in more recent years the appropriate technology movement has continued to decline in prominence germanys german appropriate technology exchange gate and hollands technology transfer for development tool are examples of organizations no longer in operation recently a study looked at the continued barriers to at deployment despite the relatively low cost of transferring information in the internet age the barriers have been identified as at seen as inferior or poor persons technology technical transferability and robustness of at insufficient funding weak institutional support and the challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty 14 a more free market-centric view has also begun to dominate the field for example paul polak founder of international development enterprises an organization that designs and manufactures products that follow the ideals of appropriate technology declared appropriate technology dead in a 2010 blog post 15 polak argues the design for the other 90 percent movement has replaced appropriate technology growing out of the appropriate technology movement designing for the other 90 percent advocates the creation of low-cost solutions for the 5.8 billion of the worlds 6.8 billion population who have little or no access to most of the products and services many of us take for granted 16 many of the ideas integral to appropriate technology can now be found in the increasingly popular sustainable development movement which among many tenets advocates technological choice that meets human needs while preserving the environment for future generations 17 in 1983 the oecd published the results of an extensive survey of appropriate technology organizations titled the world of appropriate technology in which it defined appropriate technology as characterized by low investment cost per work-place low capital investment per unit of output organizational simplicity high adaptability to a particular social or cultural environment sparing use of natural resources low cost of final product or high potential for employment 12 today the oecd web site redirects from the glossary of statistical terms entry on appropriate technology to environmentally sound technologies 18 the united nations index to economic and social development also redirects from the appropriate technology entry to sustainable development 19 potential resurgenceedit despite the decline several appropriate technology organizations are still in existence including the itdg which became practical action after a name change in 2005 20 skat schwierzerische kontaktstelle fÃ¼r angepasste technology adapted by becoming a private consultancy in 1998 though some intermediate technology activities are continued by skat foundation through the rural water supply network rwsn another actor still very active is the charity ceas centre ecologique albert schweitzer pioneer in food transformation and solar heaters it offers vocational training in west africa and madagascar there is also currently a notable resurgence as viewed by the number of groups adopting open source appropriate technology osat because of the enabling technology of the internet these osat groups include akvo appropedia appropriate technology collaborative catalytic communities centre for alternative technology center for development alternatives engineers without borders open source ecology practical action and village earth most recently asme engineers without bordersusa and the ieee have joined together to produce engineering for change which facilitates the development of affordable locally appropriate and sustainable solutions to the most pressing humanitarian challenges terminologyedit appropriate technology frequently serves as an umbrella term for a variety names for this type of technology frequently these terms are used interchangeably however the use of one term over another can indicate the specific focus bias or agenda of the technological choice in question though the original name for the concept now known as appropriate technology intermediate technology is now often considered a subset of appropriate technology that focuses on technology that is more productive than inefficient traditional technologies but less costly than the technology of industrialized societies 21 other types of technology under the appropriate technology umbrella include capital-saving technology labor-intensive technology alternate technology self-help technology village-level technology community technology progressive technology indigenous technology peoples technology light-engineering technology adaptive technology light-capital technology soft technology a variety of competing definitions exist in academic literature and organization and government policy papers for each of these terms 12 21 22 however the general consensus is appropriate technology encompasses the ideas represented by the above list furthermore the use of one term over another in referring to an appropriate technology can indicate ideological bias or emphasis on particular economic or social variables some terms inherently emphasize the importance of increased employment and labor utilization such as labor-intensive or capital-saving technology while others may emphasize the importance of human development such as self-help and peoples technology 21 it is also possible to distinguish between hard and soft technologies according to dr maurice albertson and audrey faulkner appropriate hard technology is engineering techniques physical structures and machinery that meet a need defined by a community and utilize the material at hand or readily available it can be built operated and maintained by the local people with very limited outside assistance eg technical material or financial it is usually related to an economic goal 23 albertson and faulkner consider appropriate soft technology as technology that deals with the social structures human interactive processes and motivation techniques it is the structure and process for social participation and action by individuals and groups in analyzing situations making choices and engaging in choice-implementing behaviors that bring about change 24 practitionersedit some of the well known practitioners of the appropriate technology-sector include bv doshi 25 buckminster fuller william moyer  1933â€“2002 amory lovins sanoussi diakitÃ© albert bates victor papanek giorgio ceragioli  1930â€“2008 frithjof bergmann arne nÃ¦ss  1912â€“2009 and mansur hoda 11 laurie baker developmentedit schumachers initial concept of intermediate technology was created as a critique of the currently prevailing development strategies which focused on maximizing aggregate economic growth through increases to overall measurements of a countrys economy such as gross domestic product gdp 22 developed countries became aware of the situation of developing countries during and in the years following world war ii based on the continuing rise in income levels in western countries since the industrial revolution developed countries embarked on a campaign of massive transfers of capital and technology to developing countries in order to force a rapid industrialization intended to result in an economic take-off in the developing countries 22 26 however by the late 1960s it was becoming clear this development method had not worked as expected and a growing number of development experts and national policy makers were recognizing it as a potential cause of increasing poverty and income inequality in developing countries 27 in many countries this influx of technology had increased the overall economic capacity of the country however it had created a dual or two-tiered economy with pronounced division between the classes the foreign technology imports were only benefiting a small minority of urban elites this was also increasing urbanization with the rural poor moving to urban cities in hope of more financial opportunities the increased strain on urban infrastructures and public services led to increasing squalor severe impacts on public health and distortions in the social structure 21 appropriate technology was meant to address four problems extreme poverty starvation unemployment and urban migration schumacher saw the main purpose for economic development programs was the eradication of extreme poverty and he saw a clear connection between mass unemployment and extreme poverty schumacher sought to shift development efforts from a bias towards urban areas and on increasing the output per laborer to focusing on rural areas where a majority of the population still lived and on increasing employment 28 in developed countriesedit the term appropriate technology is also used in developed nations to describe the use of technology and engineering that result in less negative impacts on the environment and society ie technology should be both environmentally sustainable and socially appropriate 29 30 e f schumacher asserts that such technology described in the book small is beautiful 31 tends to promote values such as health beauty and permanence in that order often the type of appropriate technology that is used in developed countries is appropriate and sustainable technology ast 32 appropriate technology that besides being functional and relatively cheap though often more expensive than true at is durable and employs renewable resources at does not include this see sustainable design applicationsedit building and constructionedit in order to increase the efficiency of a great number of city services efficient water provisioning efficient electricity provisioning easy traffic flow water drainage decreased spread of disease with epidemics  the city itself must first be built correctly in the developing world many cities are expanding rapidly and new ones are being built looking into the cities design in advance is a must for every developing nation adobe including the variation called super adobe rammed earth compressed earth block animal products cob andor other green building materials could be considered appropriate earth building technology for much of the developing world as they make use of materials which are widely available locally and are thus relatively inexpensive the local context must be considered as for example mudbrick may not be durable in a high rainfall area although a large roof overhang and cement stabilisation can be used to correct for this and if the materials are not readily available the method may be inappropriate other forms of natural building may be considered appropriate technology though in many cases the emphasis is on sustainability and self-sufficiency rather than affordability or suitability as such many buildings are also built to function as autonomous buildings eg earthships  one example of an organisation that applies appropriate earthbuilding techniques would be builders without borders the building structure must also be considered cost-effectiveness is an important issue in projects based around appropriate technology and one of the most efficient designs herein is the public housing approach this approach lets everyone have their own sleepingrecreation space yet incorporate communal spaces eg mess halls latrines public showers  in addition to decrease costs of operation heating cooling  techniques as earth sheltering trombe walls  are often incorporated organizations as architecture for humanity also follows principles consistent with appropriate technology aiming to serve the needs of poor and disaster-affected people natural ventilation can be created by providing vents in the upper level of a building to allow warm air to rise by convection and escape to the outside while cooler air is drawn in through vents at the lower level electrical powered fans eg ceiling fans allow efficient cooling at a far lower electricity consumption as airconditioning systems a solar chimney often referred to as thermal chimney improves this natural ventilation by using convection of air heated by passive solar energy to further maximize the cooling effect the incoming air may be led through underground ducts before it is allowed to enter the building a windcatcher badgir Ø¨Ø§Ø¯Ú¯ÛŒØ± is a traditional persian architectural device used for many centuries to create natural ventilation in buildings it is not known who first invented the windcatcher but it still can be seen in many countries today windcatchers come in various designs such as the uni-directional bi-directional and multi-directional a passive down-draft cooltower may be used in a hot arid climate to provide a sustainable way to provide air conditioning water is allowed to evaporate at the top of a tower either by using evaporative cooling pads or by spraying water evaporation cools the incoming air causing a downdraft of cool air that will bring down the temperature inside the building agricultureedit appropriate technology has been applied extensively to improve agricultural production in developing countries water and sanitationedit wateredit as of 2006 waterborne diseases are estimated to cause 1.8 million deaths each year while about 1.1 billion people lack proper drinking water 33 water generally needs treatment before use depending on the source and the intended use with high standards required for drinking water the quality of water from household connections and community water points in low-income countries is not reliably safe for direct human consumption water extracted directly from surface waters and open hand-dug shallow wells nearly always requires treatment appropriate technology options in water treatment include both community-scale and household-scale point-of-use pou designs the most reliable way to kill microbial pathogenic agents is to heat water to a rolling boil 34 other techniques such as varying forms of filtration chemical disinfection and exposure to ultraviolet radiation including solar uv have been demonstrated in an array of randomized control trials to significantly reduce levels of waterborne disease among users in low-income countries over the past decade an increasing number of field-based studies have been undertaken to determine the success of pou measures in reducing waterborne disease the ability of pou options to reduce disease is a function of both their ability to remove microbial pathogens if properly applied and such social factors as ease of use and cultural appropriateness technologies may generate more or less health benefit than their lab-based microbial removal performance would suggest the current priority of the proponents of pou treatment is to reach large numbers of low-income households on a sustainable basis few pou measures have reached significant scale thus far but efforts to promote and commercially distribute these products to the worlds poor have only been under way for a few years on the other hand small-scale water treatment is reaching increasing fractions of the population in low-income countries particularly in south and southeast asia in the form of water treatment kiosks also known as water refill stations or packaged water producers while quality control and quality assurance in such locations may be variable sophisticated technology such as multi-stage particle filtration uv irradiation ozonation and membrane filtration is applied with increasing frequency such microenterprises are able to vend water at extremely low prices with increasing government regulation initial assessments of vended water quality are encouraging whether applied at the household or community level some examples of specific treatment processes include porous ceramic filtration using either clay or diatomaceous earth and oriented as either cylinder pot or disk with gravity-fed or siphon-driven delivery systems silver is frequently added to provide antimicrobial enhancement intermittently operated slow-sand filtration also known as biosand filtration chlorine disinfection employing calcium hypochlorite powder sodium hypochlorite solution or sodium dichloroisocyanurate nadcc tablets chemical flocculation using either commercially produced iron or aluminum salts or the crushed seeds of certain plants such as moringa oleifera recent work has shown even table salt nacl is effective at removing high-activity clays for solar water disinfection 35 irradiation with ultraviolet light whether using electric-powered lamps or direct solar exposure such as with the sodis method mixed flocculationdisinfection using commercially produced powdered mixtures membrane filtration employing ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis filter elements preceded by pretreatment some appropriate technology water supply measures include deep wells with submersible pumps in areas where the groundwater aquifers are located at depths >10 m shallow wells with lined walls and covers rainwater harvesting systems with an appropriate method of storage especially in areas with significant dry seasons fog collection which is suitable for areas which experience fog even when there is little rain air wells a structure or device designed to promote the condensation of atmospheric moisture handpumps and treadle pumps are generally only an option in areas is located at a relatively shallow depth eg 10 m the flexi-pipe pump is a notable exception to this up to 25 meter for deeper aquifers <10 m submersible pumps placed inside a well are used treadle pumps for household irrigation are now being distributed on a widespread basis in developing countries the principle of village level operation and maintenance is important with handpumps but may be difficult in application condensation bags and condensation pits can be an appropriate technology to get water yet yields are low and are for the amount of water obtained labour-intensive still it may be a good very cheap solution for certain desperate communities the hippo water roller and q-drum allow more water to be carried with less effort and could thus be a good alternative for ethnic communities who do not wish to give up water gathering from remote locations assuming low topographic relief the roundabout playpump developed and used in southern africa harnesses the energy of children at play to pump water sanitationedit poor sanitation is a major issue for a large proportion of the human population with about 2.5 billion people lacking even the most basic forms of sanitation and more than a billion people worldwide practising open defecation in 2015 according to the joint monitoring programme for water supply and sanitation of the united nations 36 37 the ideas of appropriate technology influenced the provision of sanitation systems for many years however since about the early 2000s there has been a departure from a focus on simplistic one-size-fits-all sanitation systems 38 39 as conditions vary sanitation systems also need to vary to meet the needs of the users and other stakeholders 39 technologies for sanitation provision such as toilets are important but only one piece of the puzzle sanitation needs to be regarded as a system that includes technical and non-technical aspects such as behavior change and management as well as political aspects - the enabling environment 40 the overall aim should be to achieve a sustainable sanitation system one option of achieving that aim can be the ecological sanitation approach which focuses on safe reuse of excreta it is impossible to name all possible sanitation technologies that may fall under the category of appropriate technologies but some common systems which might be considered to be appropriate include dry toilets as they save on flushing water and may allow the nutrients of the excreta to be reused in agriculture eg for fertilising crops two examples of dry toilets are composting toilets and urine-diverting dry toilets constructed wetlands which can treat wastewater and greywater and require only little electrical power the sanplat is a simple plate that can be used to cover the hole in the ground of pit latrines making them potentially more easy to clean and maintain 41 42 the arborloo which is a very simple low-cost type of composting toilet suitable for rural areas energy generation and usesedit the term soft energy technology was coined by amory lovins to describe appropriate renewable energy 43 appropriate energy technologies are especially suitable for isolated andor small scale energy needs electricity can be provided from photovoltaic pv solar panels and large concentrating solar power plants pv solar panels made from low-cost photovoltaic cells or pv-cells which have first been concentrated by a luminescent solar concentrator-panel are also a good option especially companies as solfocus make appropriate technology csp plants which can be made from waste plastics polluting the surroundings see above solar thermal collector wind power home do-it yourself turbines and larger-scale micro hydro and pico hydro 44 human-powered handwheel generators 45 other zero emission generation methods some intermediate technologies include bioalcohols as bioethanol biomethanol and biobutanol the first two require minor modifications to allow them to be used in conventional gasoline engines the third requires no modifications at all vegetable oils which can be used only in internal combustion diesel engines biofuels are locally available in many developing countries and can be cheaper than fossil fuels anaerobic digestion power plants biogas is another potential source of energy particularly where there is an abundant supply of waste organic matter a generator running on biofuels can be run more efficiently if combined with batteries and an inverter this adds significantly to capital cost but reduces running cost and can potentially make this a much cheaper option than the solar wind and micro-hydro options dry animal dung fuel can also be used biochar is another similar energy source which can be obtained through charring of certain types of organic material eg hazelnut shells bamboo chicken manure  in a pyrolysis unit 46 a similar energy source is terra preta nova finally urine can also be used as a basis to generate hydrogen which is an energy carrier using urine hydrogen production is 332 more energy efficient than using water 47 electricity distribution could be improved so to make use of a more structured electricity line arrangement and universal ac power plugs and sockets eg the cee 7/7 plug in addition a universal system of electricity provisioning eg universal voltage frequency ampÃ¨re eg 230v with 50hz as well as perhaps a better mains power system eg through the use of special systems as perfected single wire earth returns eg tunisias malt-system which features low costs and easy placement 48 49 electricity storage which is required for autonomous energy systems can be provided through appropriate technology solutions as deep-cycle and car-batteries intermediate technology long duration flywheels electrochemical capacitors compressed air energy storage caes liquid nitrogen and pumped hydro 50 many solutions for the developing world are sold as a single package containing a micro electricity generation power plant and energy storage such packages are called remote-area power supply white leds and a source of renewable energy such as solar cells are used by the light up the world foundation to provide lighting to poor people in remote areas and provide significant benefits compared to the kerosene lamps which they replace certain other companies as powerplus also have led-flashlights with imbedded solar cells 51 organic leds made by roll-to-roll production are another source of cheap light that will be commercially available at low cost by 2015 compact fluorescent lamps as well as regular fluorescent lamps and led-lightbulbs can also be used as appropriate technology although they are less environmentally friendly then led-lights they are cheaper and still feature relative high efficiency compared to incandescent lamps the safe bottle lamp is a safer kerosene lamp designed in sri lanka lamps as these allow relative long mobile lighting the safety comes from a secure screw-on metal lid and two flat sides which prevent it from rolling if knocked over an alternative to fuel or oil-based lanterns is the uday lantern developed by philips as part of its lighting africa project sponsored by the world bank group 52 the faraday flashlight is a led flashlight which operates on a capacitor recharging can be done by manual winching or by shaking hereby avoiding the need of any supplementary electrical system hid-lamps finally can be used for lighting operations where regular led-lighting or other lamps will not suffice examples are car headlights due to their high efficiency they are quite environmental yet costly and they still require polluting materials in their production process transportationedit human powered-vehicles include the bicycle and the future bamboo bicycle which provides general-purpose transportation at lower costs compared to motorized vehicles and many advantages over walking and the whirlwind wheelchair which provides mobility for disabled people who cannot afford the expensive wheelchairs used in developed countries animal powered vehiclestransport may also be another appropriate technology certain zero-emissions vehicles may be considered appropriate transportation technology including compressed air cars liquid nitrogen and hydrogen-powered vehicles also vehicles with internal combustion engines may be converted to hydrogen or oxyhydrogen combustion bicycles can also be applied to commercial transport of goods to and from remote areas an example of this is karaba a free-trade coffee co-op in rwanda which uses 400 modified bicycles to carry hundreds of pounds of coffee beans for processing 53 other projects for developing countries include the redesign of cycle rickshaws to convert them to electric power 54 55 however recent reports suggest that these rickshaws are not plying on the roads 56 health careedit according to the global health council rather than the use of professionally schooled doctors the training of villagers to remedy most maladies in towns in the developing world is most appropriate 57 trained villagers are able to eliminate 80 of the health problems small low-cost hospitals based on the model of the jamkhed hospital can remedy another 15 while only 5 will need to go to a larger more expensive hospital before being able to determine the cause of the disease or malady accurate diagnosis is required this may be done manually through observation inquiries and by specialized tools a phase-change incubator developed in the late 1990s is a low cost way for health workers to incubate microbial samples birth control is also seen as an appropriate technology especially now because of increasing population numbers overpopulating certain areas increasing food prices and poverty it has been proposed to a certain degree by path program for appropriate technology in health 58 59 jaipur leg was developed by dr p k sethi and masterji ram chander in 1968 as an inexpensive prosthetic leg for victims of landmine explosions the leveraged freedom chair is a low-cost wheelchair designed specifically for rough terrain 60 natural cleaning products can be used for personal hygiene and cleaning of clothing and eating utensils in order to decrease illnessesmaladies as they eliminate a great amount of pathogens note that many appropriate technologies benefit public health in particular by providing sanitation and safe drinking water refrigeration may also provide a health benefit these are discussed in the following paragraphs this was too found at the comprehensive rural health project 61 and the women health volunteers projects in countries as iran iraq and nepal 62 food preparation and storageedit some proven intensive low-effort food-production systems include urban gardening indoors and outdoorscitation needed indoor cultivation may be set up using hydroponics with grow lights while outdoor cultivation may be done using permaculture forest gardening no-till farming do nothing farming etc in order to better control the irrigation outdoors special irrigation systems may be created as well although this increases costs and may again open the door to cultivating non-indigenous plants something which is best avoidedcitation needed one such system for the developing world is discussed here 63 crop production tools are best kept simple reduces operating difficulty cost replacement difficulties and pollution when compared to motorized equipment tools can include scythes 64 animal-pulled plows 65 although no-till farming should be preferred 66 dibbers wheeled augers 67 68 for planting large trees kirpis hoes  greenhouses are also sometimes included see earthship biotincturecitation needed sometimes they are also fitted with irrigation systems andor heat sink-systems which can respectively irrigate the plants or help to store energy from the sun and redistribute it at night when the greenhouse starts to cool down according to proponents appropriate technologies can greatly reduce the labor required to prepare food compared to traditional methods while being much simpler and cheaper than the processing used in western countries this reflects ef schumachers concept of intermediate technology ie technology which is significantly more effective and expensive than traditional methods but still an order of magnitude  10 times cheaper than developed world technology key examples are the malian peanut sheller the fonio husking machine the screenless hammer mill the isf corn mill the isf rice huller all other types of electrical or hand-operated kitchen equipment grinders cutters  special multifunctional kitchen robots that are able to perform several functions eg grinding cutting and even vacuum cleaning and polishing are able to reduce costs even more examples of these devices were eg the now discontinued piccolo household appliance from hammelmann werke previously based in bad kissingen it was equipped with a flexible axis allowing a variety of aids to be screwed on 69 70 solar cookers are appropriate to some settings depending on climate and cooking style they are emission-less and very low-cost hybrid variants also exist that incorporate a second heating source such as electrical heating or wood-based hot plates are 100 electrical fairly low cost around â‚¬20 and are mobile they do however require an electrical system to be present in the area of operation rocket stoves and certain other woodstoves eg philips woodstove 71 improve fuel efficiency and reduce harmful indoor air pollution the stoves however still make use of wood however briquette makers can now turn organic waste into fuel saving money andor collection time and preserving forests solar special einstein refrigerators and thermal mass refrigerators reduce the amount of electricity required also solar and special einstein refrigerators do not use haloalkanes which play a key role in ozone depletion but use heat pumps or mirrors instead solar refrigerators have been built for developing nations by sopology 72 73 the pot-in-pot refrigerator is an african invention which keeps things cool without electricity it provides a way to keep food and produce fresh for much longer than would otherwise be possible this can be a great benefit to the families who use the device for example it is claimed that girls who had to regularly sell fresh produce in the market can now go to school instead as there is less urgency to sell the produce before it loses freshness 74 information and communication technologiesedit the olpc xo simputer asus eee pc and other low cost computers are computers aimed at developing countries besides the low price other characteristics include resistance to dust reliability and use of the target language eldis ondisc and the appropriate technology library are projects that use cds and dvds to give access to development information in areas without reliable and affordable internet access the wind-up radio and the computer and communication system planned by the jhai foundation are independent from power supply there is also grameenphone which fused mobile telephony with grameen banks microfinance program to give bangladeshi villagers access to communication mobile telephony is appropriate technology for many developing countries as it greatly reduces the infrastructure required to achieve widespread coverage however mobile phone network may not always be available it depends on the location and may not always provide both voice and data services loband a website developed by aptivate strips all the photographic and other bandwidth-intensive content from webpages and renders them as simple text while otherwise allowing one to browse them normally the site greatly increasing the speed of browsing and is appropriate for use on low bandwidth connections as generally available in much of the developing world an increasing number of activists provide free or very inexpensive web and email services using cooperative computer networks that run wireless ad hoc networks network service is provided by a cooperative of neighbors each operating a router as a household appliance these minimize wired infrastructure and its costs and vulnerabilities private internet protocol networks set up in this way can operate without the use of a commercial provider rural electrical grids can be wired with optical phase cable in which one or more of the steel armor wires are replaced with steel tubes containing fiber optics 75 satellite internet access can provide high speed connectivity to remote locations however these are significantly more expensive than wire-based or terrestrial wireless systems wimax and forms of packet radio can also be used depending on the speed and latency of these networks they may be capable of relaying voip traffic negating the need for separate telephony services finally the internet radio linking project provides potential for blending older cheap local radio broadcasting with the increased range of the internet satellite-based telephone systems can also be used as either fixed installations or portable handsets and can be integrated into a pabx or local ip-based network financeedit through financial systems envisioned especially for the poordeveloped world many companies have been able to get started with only limited capital often banks lend the money to people wishing to start a business such as with microfinance in other systems people for a rotating savings and credit association or rosca to purchase costly material together such as tontines and susu accounts organisations communities cities or individuals can provide loans to other communitiescities such as with the approach followed by kiva world vision microloans microplace and lets finally in certain communities usually isolated communities such as small islands or oases everything of value is shared this is called gift economy determining a sustainable approachedit features such as low cost low usage of fossil fuels and use of locally available resources can give some advantages in terms of sustainability 76 for that reason these technologies are sometimes used and promoted by advocates of sustainability and alternative technology besides using natural locally available resources 77 eg wood or adobe waste materials imported from cities using conventional and inefficient waste management may be gathered and re-used to build a sustainable living environment use of these cities waste material allows the gathering of a huge amount of building material at a low cost when obtained the materials may be recycled over and over in the own citycommunity using the cradle to cradle design method locations where waste can be found include landfills junkyards on water surfaces and anywhere around towns or near highways organic waste that can be reused to fertilise plants can be found in sewages also town districts and other places eg cemeteries that are subject of undergoing renovation or removal can be used for gathering materials as stone concrete or potassium related social movementsedit appropedia community-based economics campus center for
