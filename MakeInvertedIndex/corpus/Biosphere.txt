biosphere the biosphere is the global sum of all ecosystems the two joined words are bio and sphere it can also be termed as the zone of life on earth a closed system apart from solar and cosmic radiation and heat from the interior of the earth and largely self-regulating 1 by the most general biophysiological definition the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere geosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere the biosphere is postulated to have evolved beginning with a process of biopoesis life created naturally from non-living matter such as simple organic compounds or biogenesis life created from living matter at least some 3.5 billion years ago 2 3 the earliest evidence for life on earth includes biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks from western greenland 4 and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone from western australia 5 6 more recently in 2015 remains of biotic life were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia 7 8 according to one of the researchers if life arose relatively quickly on earth  then it could be common in the universe 7 in a general sense biospheres are any closed self-regulating systems containing ecosystems this includes artificial biospheres such as biosphere 2 and bios-3 and potentially ones on other planets or moons 9  contents 1 origin and use of the term 1.1 narrow definition 2 extent of earths biosphere 3 specific biospheres 4 extraterrestrial biospheres 5 see also 6 references 7 external links 1.1 narrow definition  origin and use of the termedit the term biosphere was coined by geologist eduard suess in 1875 which he defined as the place on earths surface where life dwells 10 while the concept has a geological origin it is an indication of the effect of both charles darwin and matthew f maury on the earth sciences the biospheres ecological context comes from the 1920s see vladimir i vernadsky preceding the 1935 introduction of the term ecosystem by sir arthur tansley see ecology history vernadsky defined ecology as the science of the biosphere it is an interdisciplinary concept for integrating astronomy geophysics meteorology biogeography evolution geology geochemistry hydrology and generally speaking all life and earth sciences narrow definitionedit geochemists define the biosphere as being the total sum of living organisms the biomass or biota as referred to by biologists and ecologists in this sense the biosphere is but one of four separate components of the geochemical model the other three being geosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere when these four component spheres are combined into one system it is known as the ecosphere this term was coined during the 1960s and encompasses both biological and physical components of the planet 11 the second international conference on closed life systems defined biospherics as the science and technology of analogs and models of earths biosphere ie artificial earth-like biospheres 12 others may include the creation of artificial non-earth biospheresfor example human-centered biospheres or a native martian biosphereas part of the topic of biosphericscitation needed extent of earths biosphereedit every part of the planet from the polar ice caps to the equator features life of some kind recent advances in microbiology have demonstrated that microbes live deep beneath the earths terrestrial surface and that the total mass of microbial life in so-called uninhabitable zones may in biomass exceed all animal and plant life on the surface the actual thickness of the biosphere on earth is difficult to measure birds typically fly at altitudes as high as 1,800m  5,900ft 1.1mi and fish live as much as 8,372m  27,467ft 5.202mi underwater in the puerto rico trench 2 there are more extreme examples for life on the planet rüppells vulture has been found at altitudes of 11,300m  37,100ft 7.0mi bar-headed geese migrate at altitudes of at least 8,300m  27,200ft 5.2mi yaks live at elevations as high as 5,400m  17,700ft 3.4mi above sea level mountain goats live up to 3,050m  10,010ft 1.90mi herbivorous animals at these elevations depend on lichens grasses and herbs microscopic organisms live in every part of the biosphere including soil hot springs seven miles deep in the ocean "40 miles high in the atmosphere and inside rocks far down within the earths crust see also endolith 13 microorganisms under certain test conditions have been observed to thrive in the vacuum of outer space 14 15 the total amount of soil and subsurface bacterial carbon is estimated as 5 x 1017 g or the weight of the united kingdom 13 the mass of prokaryote microorganisms  which includes bacteria and archaea but not the nucleated eukaryote microorganisms  may be as much as 0.8 trillion tons of carbon of the total biosphere mass estimated at between 1 and 4 trillion tons 16 barophilic marine microbes have been found at more than a depth of 10,000m  33,000ft 6.2mi in the mariana trench the deepest spot in the earths oceans 17 in fact single-celled life forms have been found in the deepest part of the mariana trench by the challenger deep at depths of 11,034m  36,201ft 6.856mi 18 19 20 other researchers reported related studies that microorganisms thrive inside rocks up to 580m  1,900ft 0.36mi below the sea floor under 2,590m  8,500ft 1.61mi of ocean off the coast of the northwestern united states 19 21 as well as 2,400m  7,900ft 1.5mi beneath the seabed off japan 22 culturable thermophilic microbes have been extracted from cores drilled more than 5,000m  16,000ft 3.1mi into the earths crust in sweden 23 from rocks between 65–75c  149–167f temperature increases with increasing depth into the earths crust the rate at which the temperature increases depends on many factors including type of crust continental vs oceanic rock type geographic location etc the greatest known temperature at which microbial life can exist is 122c  252f methanopyrus kandleri strain 116 and it is likely that the limit of life in the deep biosphere is defined by temperature rather than absolute depthcitation needed on 20 august 2014 scientists confirmed the existence of microorganisms living 800m  2,600ft 0.50mi below the ice of antarctica 24 25 according to one researcher you can find microbes everywhere  theyre extremely adaptable to conditions and survive wherever they are 19 our biosphere is divided into a number of biomes inhabited by fairly similar flora and fauna on land biomes are separated primarily by latitude terrestrial biomes lying within the arctic and antarctic circles are relatively barren of plant and animal life while most of the more populous biomes lie near the equator specific biospheresedit for this list if a word is followed by a number it is usually referring to a specific system or number thus biosphere 1 the planet earth biosphere 2 laboratory in arizona united states which contains 3.15 acres  13,000 m2 of closed ecosystem bios-3 a closed ecosystem at the institute of biophysics in krasnoyarsk siberia in what was then the soviet union biosphere j ceef closed ecology experiment facilities an experiment in japan 26 27 extraterrestrial biospheresedit no biospheres have been detected beyond the earth therefore the existence of extraterrestrial biospheres remains hypothetical the rare earth hypothesis suggests they should be very rare save ones composed of microbial life only 28 on the other hand earth analogs may be quite numerous at least in the milky way galaxy 29 given limited understanding of abiogenesis it is currently unknown what percentage of these planets actually develop biospheres it is also possible that artificial biospheres will be created during the future for example on mars 30 the process of creating an uncontained system that mimics the function of earths biosphere is called terraforming 31 see alsoedit environment portal ecology portal earth sciences portal sustainable development portal abiogenesis biosphere reserve
