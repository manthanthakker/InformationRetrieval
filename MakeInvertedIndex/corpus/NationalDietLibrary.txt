three separate libraries the library of the house of peers the library of the house of representatives both of which were established at the creation of japans imperial diet in 1890 and the imperial library which had been established in 1872 under the jurisdiction of the ministry of education the diets power in prewar japan was limited and its need for information was correspondingly small the original diet libraries never developed either the collections or the services which might have made them vital adjuncts of genuinely responsible legislative activity until japans defeat moreover the executive had controlled all political documents depriving the people and the diet of access to vital information the us occupation forces under general douglas macarthur deemed reform of the diet library system to be an important part of the democratization of japan after its defeat in world war ii in 1946 each house of the diet formed its own national diet library standing committee hani gorō

the reform efforts hani envisioned the new body as both a citadel of popular sovereignty and the means of realizing a peaceful revolution the occupation officers responsible for overseeing library reforms reported that although the occupation was a catalyst for change local initiative pre-existed the occupation and the successful reforms were due to dedicated japanese like hani the national
