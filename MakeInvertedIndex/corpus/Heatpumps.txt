heat pump a heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a heat sink heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one a heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink while air conditioners and freezers are familiar examples of heat pumps the term heat pump is more general and applies to many hvac heating ventilating and air conditioning devices used for space heating or space cooling when a heat pump is used for heating it employs the same basic refrigeration-type cycle used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator but in the opposite direction - releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment in this use heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground 1 in heating mode heat pumps are three to four times more efficient in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters typically installed cost for a heat pump is about 20 times greater than

hvac applications the term heat pump usually refers to easily reversible vapor-compression refrigeration devices optimized for high efficiency in both directions of thermal energy transfer heat spontaneously flows from warmer places to colder spaces a heat pump can absorb heat from a cold space and release it to a warmer one heat is not conserved in this process which requires some amount of external high grade low-entropy energy such as electricity heat pumps are used to provide heating because less high-grade energy is required for their operation than appears in the released heat most of the energy for heating comes from the external environment and only a fraction comes from electricity or some other high-grade energy source required to run a compressor in electrically powered heat pumps the heat transferred can be three or four times larger than the electrical power consumed giving the system a coefficient of performance cop of 3 or 4 as opposed to a cop of 1 for a conventional electrical resistance heater in which all heat is produced from input electrical energy heat pumps use a refrigerant as an intermediate fluid to absorb heat where it vaporizes in the evaporator and then to release heat where the refrigerant condenses in the condenser the refrigerant flows through insulated pipes between the evaporator and the condenser allowing for efficient thermal energy transfer at relatively long distances reversible heat pumpsedit reversible heat pumps work in either thermal direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space they employ a reversing valve to reverse the flow of refrigerant from the compressor through the condenser and evaporation coils in heating mode the outdoor coil is an evaporator while the indoor is a condenser the refrigerant flowing from the evaporator outdoor coil carries the thermal energy from outside air or soil indoors after the vapour temperature has been augmented by compressing it the indoor coil then transfers thermal energy including energy from the compression to the indoor air which is then moved around the inside of the building by an air handler alternatively thermal energy is transferred to water which is then used to heat the building via radiators or underfloor heating the heated water may also be used for domestic hot water consumption the refrigerant is then allowed to expand cool and absorb heat to reheat to the outdoor temperature in the outside evaporator and the cycle repeats this is a standard refrigeration cycle save that the cold side of the refrigerator the evaporator coil is positioned so it is outdoors where the environment is colder in cold weather the outdoor unit is intermittently defrosted by briefly switching to the cooling mode this will cause the auxiliary or emergency heating elements located in the air-handler to be activated at the same time the frost on the outdoor coil will quickly be melted due to the warm refrigerant the condenserevaporator fan will not run during defrost mode in cooling mode the cycle is similar but the outdoor coil is now the condenser and the indoor coil which reaches a lower temperature is the evaporator this is the familiar mode in which air conditioners operate operating principlesedit mechanical heat pumps exploit the physical properties of a volatile evaporating and condensing fluid known as a refrigerant the heat pump compresses the refrigerant to make it hotter on the side to be warmed and releases the pressure at the side where heat is absorbed the working fluid in its gaseous state is pressurized and circulated through the system by a compressor on the discharge side of the compressor the now hot and highly pressurized vapor is cooled in a heat exchanger called a condenser until it condenses into a high pressure moderate temperature liquid the condensed refrigerant then passes through a pressure-lowering device also called a metering device this may be an expansion valve capillary tube or possibly a work-extracting device such as a turbine the low-pressure liquid refrigerant then enters another heat exchanger the evaporator in which the fluid absorbs heat and boils the refrigerant then returns to the compressor and the cycle is repeatedcitation needed it is essential that the refrigerant reach a sufficiently high temperature when compressed to release heat through the hot heat exchanger the condenser similarly the fluid must reach a sufficiently low temperature when allowed to expand or else heat cannot flow from the ambient cold region into the fluid in the cold heat exchanger the evaporator in particular the pressure difference must be great enough for the fluid to condense at the hot side and still evaporate in the lower pressure region at the cold side the greater the temperature difference the greater the required pressure difference and consequently the more energy needed to compress the fluid thus as with all heat pumps the coefficient of performance amount of thermal energy moved per unit of input work required decreases with increasing temperature difference insulation is used to reduce the work and energy required to achieve a low enough temperature in the space to be cooled to operate in different temperature conditions different refrigerants are available refrigerators air conditioners and some heating systems are common applications that use this technologycitation needed heat transportedit heat is typically transported through engineered heating or cooling systems by using a flowing gas or liquid air is sometimes used but quickly becomes impractical under many circumstances because it requires large ducts to transfer relatively small amounts of heat in systems using refrigerant this working fluid can also be used to transport heat a considerable distance though this can become impractical because of increased risk of expensive refrigerant leakage when large amounts of heat are to be transported water is typically used often supplemented with antifreeze corrosion inhibitors and other additives heat sourcessinksedit a common source or sink for heat in smaller installations is the outside air as used by an air-source heat pump a fan is needed to improve heat exchange efficiency larger installations handling more heat or in tight physical spaces often use water-source heat pumps the heat is sourced or rejected in water flow which can carry much larger amounts of heat through a given pipe or duct cross-section than air flow can carry the water may be heated at a remote location by boilers solar energy or other means alternatively when needed the water may be cooled by using a cooling tower or discharged into a large body of water such as a lake stream or an ocean geothermal heat pumps or ground-source heat pumps use shallow underground heat exchangers as a heat source or sink and water as the heat transport medium this is possible because below ground level the temperature is relatively constant across the seasons and the earth can provide or absorb a large amount of heat ground source heat pumps work in the same way as air-source heat pumps but exchange heat with the ground via water pumped through pipes in the ground ground source heat pumps are more simple and therefore more reliable than air source heat pumps as they do not need fan or defrosting systems and can be housed inside although a ground heat exchanger requires a higher initial capital cost the annual running costs are lower because well-designed ground source heat pump systems operate more efficiently heat pump installations may be installed alongside an auxiliary conventional heat source such as electrical resistance heaters or oil or gas combustion the auxiliary source is installed to meet peak heating loads or to provide a back-up system applicationsedit there are millions of domestic installations using common air source electric heat pumps 4 they are used in climates with moderate space heating and cooling needs hvac and may also provide domestic hot water 5 the purchase costs are supported in various countries by consumer rebates 6 hvacedit in hvac applications a heat pump is typically a vapor-compression refrigeration device that includes a reversing valve and optimized heat exchangers so that the direction of heat flow thermal energy movement may be reversed the reversing valve switches the direction of refrigerant through the cycle and therefore the heat pump may deliver either heating or cooling to a building in cooler climates the default setting of the reversing valve is heating the default setting in warmer climates is cooling because of the two heat exchangers the condenser and evaporator must swap functions they are optimized to perform adequately in both modes therefore the seer rating which is the seasonal energy efficiency rating of a reversible heat pump is typically slightly less than two separately optimized machines for equipment to receive the energy star rating it must have a rating of at least 14.5 seer 7 plumbingedit in plumbing applications a heat pump is sometimes used to heat or preheat water for swimming pools or domestic water heaters the heat energy removed from an air-conditioned space may be recovered for heating water district heatingedit commissioned in 2011 this district heating extracts heat from a fjord whose temperature is around 8c using 3 systems giving a combined capacity of 14 megawatts to town center residences and businesses a city ordinance mandates this heating system for many new buildings refrigerantsedit until the 1990s the refrigerants were often chlorofluorocarbons such as r-12 dichlorodifluoromethane one in a class of several refrigerants using the brand name freon a trademark of dupont its manufacture was discontinued in 1995 because of the damage that cfcs cause to the ozone layer if released into the atmospherecitation needed one widely adopted replacement refrigerant is the hydrofluorocarbon hfc known as r-134a  1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane heat pumps using r-134a are not as efficient as those using r-12 that they replace in automotive applications and therefore more energy is required to operate systems utilizing r-134a than those using r-12citation needed other substances such as liquid r-717 ammonia are widely used in large-scale systems or occasionally the less corrosive but more flammable propane or butane can also be used since 2001 carbon dioxide r-744 has increasingly been used utilizing the transcritical cycle although it requires much higher working pressures in residential and commercial applications the hydrochlorofluorocarbon hcfc r-22 is still widely used however hfc r-410a does not deplete the ozone layer and is being used more frequently however it is a powerful greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change 8 9 hydrogen helium nitrogen or plain air is used in the stirling cycle providing the maximum number of options in environmentally friendly gases more recent refrigerators use r600a which is isobutane and does not deplete the ozone and is friendly to the environmentcitation needed dimethyl ether dme is also gaining popularity as a refrigerant 10 noiseedit both indoor and outdoor heat pump units contain moving mechanical components which produce noise in 2013 the cen started work on standards for protection from noise pollution caused by heat pump outdoor units 11 although the centc 113 business plan outset was that consumers increasingly require a low acoustic power of these units as the users and their neighbours now reject noisy installations no standards for noise barriers or other means of noise protection had been developed by january 2016 noise from outdoor units sometimes exceeds noise levels permitted by the legislation for example the 2015 data sheet of the mr slim zubadan inverter heat pump informs whoever reads it including the pumps owners neighbors that the mr slim outdoor unit generates 52dba in heating mode 12 this is more than is permitted by legislation in some countries for example the uk 13 where this or similar pumps are used another example is poland where the noise level permitted in residential areas is 40db at night 14 which is more than the uk limit  35db but still puts the mr slim outdoor unit 12db above the limit in the united states the allowed nighttime noise level was defined in 1974 as an average 24-hr exposure limit of 55 a-weighted decibels dba to protect the public from all adverse effects on health and welfare in residential areas us epa 1974 this limit is a daynight 24-hr average noise level ldn with a 10-dba penalty applied to nighttime levels between 2200 and 0700 hours to account for sleep disruption and no penalty applied to daytime levels 15 the 10-dba penalty makes the permitted us nighttime noise level equal to 45 dba which is more than is accepted in some european countries but less than the noise produced by some heat pumps therefore it is important to pay special attention to those heat pumps which are advertised as being extremely efficient and generating noise at a very low level supposedly at the same time the simultaneity of the two conditions being met together can be tested in the example of the toshiba residential super daiseikai g2kvp inverter hiwall heat pump 16 the product is advertised as having extremely high efficiencies with 5.15 and a noise level of only 20 db in ultra-low fan speed for the ras-10g2kvp it is possible to download a brochure by clicking on a pdf download button at the bottom of the site the technical specifications are given on the last page of the brochure and one can verify the correctness of the initial commercial information the detail missing at the beginning is that the value of 20dba for ras-10g2kvp only refers to the indoor unit in the quiet mode  42dba in the high mode whereas the external unit produces 61dba in the heating mode which is not reported in the commercial introduction the level of 61db a exceeds the environmental noise limits worldwide the location of an outdoor unit in relation to the building wall is significant the unit  1 shown on page 7 of the heat pump product brochure 17 published by american standard heatingconditioning is placed close to the center of the house wall like a musician of the symphony orchestra playing a concerto shells and walls made of hard material are used behind a sound source if passive sound amplification is desired such a location of the outdoor unit adds extra dba of noise reflected from the wall the db level is not reported in the brochure and the location of the neighbors house is not shown in the picture but this type of location should not be used close to a place planned as a quiet place even if the unit is quiet the heat pump outdoor unit is not a musician performing to an audience another feature of ashp external heat exchangers is their need to stop the fan from time to time for a period of several minutes in order to get rid of frost 18 that accumulates in the outdoor unit in the heating mode after that the heat pump starts to work again this part of the work cycle results in two sudden changes of the noise made by the fan the acoustic effect of such disruption on neighbors is especially powerful in quiet environments where background nighttime noise may be as low as 0 to 10dba this is included in legislation in france according to the french concept of noise nuisance noise emergence is the difference between ambient noise including the disturbing noise and ambient noise without the disturbing noise 19 20 the emergence should be below 3dba at night between 10.00 pm and 7.00 am so the pump in france once stopped at night theoretically should not be allowed to switch on again until morning in addition the level of ambient noise including the disturbing noise must be below 30dba in france a condition which definitely cannot be met without an effective sound barrier by most ashps which were commercially available by the end of 2015 however ashp outdoor units are still being installed in residential areas worldwide without any noise protection as no recognized standards for heat pump outdoor noise barriers are available yet as of january 2016 performance considerationsedit when comparing the performance of heat pumps it is best to avoid the word efficiency which has a very specific thermodynamic definition the term coefficient of performance cop is used to describe the ratio of useful heat movement per work input most vapor-compression heat pumps use electrically powered motors for their work input according to the us epa geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption up to 44 compared with air-source heat pumps and up to 72 compared with electric resistance heating 21 heatpumps in general have a cop of 4.2 to 4.6 which places it behind cogeneration with a cop of 9 22 when used for heating a building with an outside temperature of for example 10c a typical air-source heat pump ashp has a cop of 3 to 4 whereas an electrical resistance heater has a cop of 1.0 that is one joule of electrical energy will cause a resistance heater to produce only one joule of useful heat while under ideal conditions one joule of electrical energy can cause a heat pump to move three or four joules of heat from a cooler place to a warmer place note that an air source heat pump is more efficient in hotter climates than cooler ones so when the weather is much warmer the unit will perform with a higher cop as it has a smaller temperature gap to bridge when there is a wide temperature differential between the hot and cold reservoirs the cop is lower worse in extreme cold weather the cop will go down to 1.0 on the other hand ground-source heat pumps gshp benefit from the moderate temperature underground as the ground acts naturally as a store of thermal energy 23 their year-round cop is therefore normally in the range of 2.5 to 5.0 when there is a high temperature differential eg when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of say 0c  32f it takes more work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day ultimately due to carnot efficiency limits the heat pumps performance will decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases outside temperature gets colder reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at −273c in practice a cop of 1.0 will typically be reached at an outdoor temperature around −18c  0f for air source heat pumps also as the heat pump takes heat out of the air some moisture in the outdoor air may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger the system must periodically melt this ice this defrosting translates into an additional energy electricity expenditure when it is extremely cold outside it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source such as an electric resistance heater oil furnace or gas furnace rather than to run an air-source heat pump also avoiding the use of the heat pump during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machines compressor the design of the evaporator and condenser heat exchangers is also very important to the overall efficiency of the heat pump the heat exchange surface areas and the corresponding temperature differential between the refrigerant and the air stream directly affect the operating pressures and hence the work the compressor has to do in order to provide the same heating or cooling effect generally the larger the heat exchanger the lower the temperature differential and the more efficient the system becomes heat exchangers are expensive requiring drilling for some heat-pump types or large spaces to be efficient and the heat pump industry generally competes on price rather than efficiency heat pumps are already at a price disadvantage when it comes to initial investment not long-term savings compared to conventional heating solutions like boilers so the drive towards more efficient heat pumps and air conditioners is often led by legislative measures on minimum efficiency standards electricity rates will also influence the attractiveness of heat pumps 24 in cooling mode a heat pumps operating performance is described in the us as its energy efficiency ratio eer or seasonal energy efficiency ratio seer and both measures have units of btuhw  1 btuhw 0.293 ww a larger eer number indicates better performance the manufacturers literature should provide both a cop to describe performance in heating mode and an eer or seer to describe performance in cooling mode actual performance varies however and depends on many factors such as installation details temperature differences site elevation and maintenance as with any piece of equipment that depends on coils to transfer heat between air and a fluid it is important for both the condenser and evaporator coils to be kept clean if deposits of dust and other debris are allowed to accumulate on the coils the efficiency of the unit both in heating and cooling modes will suffer heat pumps are more effective for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal this is because the compressors input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space but for cooling the condenser is normally outdoors and the compressors dissipated work waste heat must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy rather than being put to a useful purpose for the same reason opening a food refrigerator or freezer has the net effect of heating up the room rather than cooling it because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air this heat includes the compressors dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance the cop for a heat pump in a heating or cooling application with steady-state operation is where δ q cool displaystyle delta qtextcool is the amount of heat extracted from a cold reservoir at temperature t cool displaystyle ttextcool  δ q hot displaystyle delta qtexthot is the amount of heat delivered to a hot reservoir at temperature t hot displaystyle ttexthot  δ a displaystyle delta a is the compressors dissipated work all temperatures are absolute temperatures usually measured in kelvins or degrees rankine coefficient of performance cop and liftedit the cop increases as the temperature difference or lift decreases between heat source and destination the cop can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature eg underfloor heating and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature eg the ground domestic hot water dhw and conventional heating radiators require high water temperatures reducing the cop that can be attained and affecting the choice of heat pump technologycitation needed one observation is that while current best practice heat pumps ground source system operating between 0c and 35c have a typical cop around 4 no better than 5 the maximum achievable is 8.8 because of fundamental carnot cycle limits this means that in the coming decades the energy efficiency of top-end heat pumps could roughly double cranking up efficiency requires the development of a better gas compressor fitting hvac machines with larger heat exchangers with slower gas flows and solving internal lubrication problems resulting from slower gas flow depending on the working fluid the expansion stage can be important also work done by the expanding fluid cools it and is available to replace some of the input power an evaporating liquid is cooled by free expansion through a small hole but an ideal gas is not typesedit compression vs absorptionedit the two main types of heat pumps are compression and absorption compression heat pumps operate on mechanical energy typically driven by electricity while absorption heat pumps may also run on heat as an energy source from electricity or burnable fuels 28 an absorption heat pump may be fueled by natural gas or lp gas for example while the gas utilization efficiency in such a device which is the ratio of the energy supplied to the energy consumed may average only 1.5 that is better than a natural gas or lp gas furnace which can only approach 1 heat sources and sinksedit by definition all heat sources for a heat pump must be colder in temperature than the space to be heated most commonly heat pumps draw heat from the air outside or inside air or from the ground groundwater or soil 29 the heat drawn from ground-sourced systems is in most cases stored solar heat and it should not be confused with direct geothermal heating though the latter will contribute in some small measure to all heat in the ground true geothermal heat when used for heating requires a circulation pump but no heat pump since for this technology the ground temperature is higher than that of the space that is to be heated so the technology relies only upon simple heat convection other heat sources for heat pumps include water nearby streams and other natural water bodies have been used and sometimes domestic waste water via drain water heat recovery which is often warmer than cold winter ambient temperatures though still of lower temperature than the space to be heated a number of sources have been used for the heat source for heating private and communal buildings 30 air ashpedit air source heat pump extracts heat from outside air airair heat pump transfers heat to inside air airwater heat pump transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water airair heat pump transfers heat to inside air airwater heat pump transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water air-air heat pumps that extract heat from outside air and transfer this heat to inside air are the most common type of heat pumps and the cheapest these are similar to air conditioners operating in reverse air-water heat pumps are otherwise similar to air-air heat pumps but they transfer the extracted heat into a water heating circuit floor heating being the most efficient and they can also transfer heat into a domestic hot water tank for use in showers and hot water taps of the building however ground-water heat pumps are more efficient than air-water heat pumps and therefore they are often the better choice for providing heat for the floor heating and domestic hot water systems air source heat pumps are relatively easy and inexpensive to install and have therefore historically been the most widely used heat pump type however they suffer limitations due to their use of the outside air as a heat source the higher temperature differential during periods of extreme cold leads to declining efficiency in mild weather cop may be around 4.0 while at temperatures below around 0c  32f an air-source heat pump may still achieve a cop of 2.5 the average cop over seasonal variation is typically 2.5-2.8 with exceptional models able to exceed this in mild climates in areas where only fossil fuels are available eg heating oil only no natural gas pipes available air source heat pumps could be used as an alternative supplemental heat source to reduce a buildings dependence on fossil fuel depending on fuel and electricity prices using the heat pump for heating may be less expensive than using fossil fuel a backup fossil-fuel solar hot water or biomass heat source may still be required for the coldest dayscitation needed the heating output of low temperature optimized heat pumps and hence their energy efficiency still declines dramatically as the temperature drops but the threshold at which the decline starts is lower than conventional pumps as shown in the following table temperatures are approximate and may vary

also called geothermal heat pumps typically have higher efficiencies than air-source heat pumps this is because they draw heat from the ground or groundwater which is at a relatively constant temperature all year round below a depth of about 30 feet  9 m 31 this means that the temperature differential is lower leading to higher efficiency well maintained ground-source heat pumps typically have cops of 4.0 32 at the beginning of the heating season with lower seasonal cops of around 3.0 as heat is drawn from the ground the tradeoff for this improved performance is that a ground-source heat pump is more expensive to install due to the need for the drilling of boreholes for vertical placement of heat exchanger piping or the digging of trenches for horizontal placement of the piping that carries the heat exchange fluid water with a little antifreeze when compared groundwater heat pumps are generally more efficient than heat pumps using heat from the soil closed loop soil or ground heat exchangers tend to accumulate cold if the ground loop is undersized this can be a significant problem if nearby ground water is stagnant or the soil lacks thermal conductivity and the overall system has been designed to be just big enough to handle a typical worst case cold spell or is simply undersized for the load 33 one way to fix cold accumulation in the ground heat exchanger loop is to use ground water to cool the floors of the building on hot days thereby transferring heat from the dwelling into the ground loop there are several other methods for replenishing a low temperature ground loop one way is to make large solar collectors for instance by putting plastic pipes just under the roof or by putting coils of black polyethylene pipes under glass on the roof or by piping the tarmac of the parking lot 34 a further solution is to ensure ground collector arrays are correctly sized by ensuring soil thermal properties and thermal conductivity are correctly measured and integrated into the design 35 exhaust air eahpedit exhaust air heat pump extracts heat from the exhaust air of a building requires mechanical ventilation exhaust air-air heat pump

combustion or other sources hybrid hhpedit hybrid or twin source heat pumps when outdoor air is above 4 to 8 celsius  40-50 fahrenheit depending on ground water temperature they use air when air is colder they use the ground source these twin source systems can also store summer heat by running ground source water through the air exchanger or through the building heater-exchanger even when the heat pump itself is not running this has dual advantage it functions as a low running cost for air cooling and if ground water is relatively stagnant it cranks up the temperature of the ground source which improves the energy efficiency of the heat pump system by roughly 4 for each degree in temperature rise of the ground source airwater-brinewater heat pump hybrid heat pumpedit the airwater-brinewater heat pump is a hybrid heat pump developed in rostock germany that uses only renewable energy sources unlike other hybrid systems which usually combine both conventional and renewable energy sources it combines air and geothermal heat in one compact device the airwater-brinewater heat pump has two evaporators  an outside air evaporator and a brine evaporator  both connected to the heat pump cycle this allows use of the most economical heating source for the current external conditions for example air temperature the unit automatically selects the most efficient operating mode  air or geothermal heat or both together the process is controlled by a control unit which processes the large amounts of data delivered by the complex heating system the control unit comprises two controllers one for the air heat cycle and one for the geothermal circulation in one device all components communicate over a common bus to ensure they interact to enhance the efficiency of the hybrid heating system the german patent and trade mark office in munich granted the airwater-brinewater heat pump a patent in 2008 under the title heat pump and method for controlling the source inlet temperature to the heat pump this hybrid heat pump can be combined with a solar thermal system or with an ice-storage it trades and is marketed under the name thermselect in the united kingdom thermselect won the 2013 commercial heating product of the year award of the hvr awards for excellence organised by heating and ventilating review an industry magazine solar-assisted heat pump sahpedit a sahp is a machine that represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system typically these two technologies are used separately or only placing them in parallel to produce hot water 36 in this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pumps evaporator 37 the goal of this system is to get high cop and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way heat distributionedit heat pumps are only highly efficient when they generate heat at a low temperature differential ideally around or below 32c  90f normal steel plate radiators are not practical because they would need to be four to six times their current size underfloor heating is one ideal solution when wooden floors or carpets would spoil efficiency wall heaters plastic pipes covered with a thick layer of chalk and piped ceilings can be used these systems have the disadvantage that they are slow starters and that they would require extensive renovation in existing buildings the alternative is a warm air system such a setup can either complement slower floor heating during warm up or it can be a quick and economical way to implement a heat pump system into existing buildings oversizing the fans and ductwork can reduce the acoustic noise they produce to efficiently distribute warm water or air from a heat pump water pipes or air shafts must have significantly larger diameters than in conventional hotter-source systems and underfloor heaters should have much more pipes per square metercitation needed solid state heat pumpsedit magneticedit in 1881 the german physicist emil warburg put a block of iron into a strong magnetic field and found that it increased very slightly in temperature some commercial ventures to implement this technology are underway claiming to cut energy consumption by 40 compared to current domestic refrigerators 38 the process works as follows powdered gadolinium is moved into a magnetic field heating the material by 2 to 5c  4 to 9f the heat is removed by a circulating fluid the material is then moved out of the magnetic field reducing its temperature below its starting temperaturecitation needed thermoelectricedit solid state heat pumps using the thermoelectric effect have improved over time to the point where they are useful for certain refrigeration tasks thermoelectric peltier heat pumps are generally only around 10-15 as efficient as the ideal refrigerator carnot cycle compared with 40–60 achieved by conventional compression cycle systems reverse rankine systems using compressionexpansion 39 however this area of technology is currently the subject of active research in materials science a reason why this is popular is because it has a long lifetime as there are no moving parts and it does not use potentially hazardous refrigerants thermoacousticedit near-solid-state heat pumps using
