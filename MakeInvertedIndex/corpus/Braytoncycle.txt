onsager rankine smeaton stahl thompson thomson waterston v t e the brayton cycle is a thermodynamic cycle named after george bailey brayton that describes the workings of a constant pressure heat engine the original brayton engines used a piston compressor and piston expander but more modern gas turbine engines and airbreathing jet engines also follow the brayton cycle although the cycle is usually run as an open system and indeed must be run as such if internal combustion is usedcitation needed it is conventionally assumed for the purposes of thermodynamic analysis that the exhaust gases are reused in the intake enabling analysis as a closed system the engine cycle is named after george brayton  1830–1892 the american engineer who developed it originally for use in piston engines  although it was originally proposed and patented by englishman john barber in 1791 1 it is also sometimes known as the joule cycle the ericsson cycle is similar to the brayton cycle but uses external heat and incorporates the use of a regenerator there are two types of brayton cycles open to the atmosphere and using internal combustion chamber or closed and using a heat exchanger

engine the engine was a 2-stroke and produced power on every revolution brayton engines used a separate piston compressor and piston expander with compressed air heated by internal fire as it entered the expander cylinder the first versions of the brayton engine were vapor engines which mixed fuel with air as it entered the compressor by means of a heated-surface carburetor 2 the fuel  air was contained in a reservoir  tank and then it was admitted to the expansion cylinder and burned as the fuel  air mixture entered the expansion cylinder it was ignited by a pilot flame a screen was used to prevent the fire from entering  returning to the reservoir in early versions of the engine this screen sometimes failed and an explosion would occur in 1874 brayton solved the explosion problem by adding the fuel just prior to the expander cylinder the engine now used heavier fuels such as kerosine and fuel oil ignition remained pilot flame 3 brayton produced and sold ready motors to perform a variety of tasks like water pumping mill operation running generators and marine propulsion the ready motors were produced from 1872 to sometime in the 1880s how many of these engines were produced is not known probably there were several hundred possibly a thousand brayton licensed the design to simone in the uk there were many variations of the layout some were single-acting and some were double-acting some had under walking beams others had overhead walking beams there were both horizontal and vertical models sizes ranged from less than one horsepower to over 40 horsepower critics of the time claimed the engines ran smoothly and had a reasonable efficiency 4 brayton cycle engines were some of the first internal combustion engines used for motive power in 1875 john holland used a brayton engine to power the worlds first self-propelled submarine holland boat #1 in 1879 a brayton engine was used to power a second submarine the fenian ram john philip hollands submarines are preserved in the paterson museum in the old great falls historic district of paterson new jersey 5 in 1878 george b selden patented the first internal combustion automobile 6 inspired by the internal combustion engine invented by george brayton displayed at the centennial exposition in philadelphia in 1876 selden patented a 4 wheel car working on a smaller lighter multi-cylinder version he then filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process resulting in a delay of 16 years before the patent 7 was granted on november 5 1895 in 1903 selden sued ford for patent infringement and henry ford fought the selden patent until 1911 selden had never actually produced a working car so during the trial 2 machines were constructed according to the patent drawings ford argued his cars used the four-stroke alphonse beau de rochas cycle or otto cycle and not the brayton cycle engine used in the selden auto ford won the appeal of the original case 8 in 1887 brayton developed and patented a 4 stroke direct injection oil engine us patent #432,114 of 1890 application filed in 1887 the fuel system used a variable quantity pump and liquid fuel high pressure spray type injection the liquid was forced through a spring loaded relief type valve injector which caused the fuel to become divided into small droplets injection was timed to occur at or near the peak of the compression stroke a platinum igniter or ignitor provided the source of ignition brayton describes the invention as follows i have discovered that heavy oils can be mechanically converted into a finely-divided condition within a firing portion of the cylinder or in a communicating firing chamber another part reads i have for the first time so far as my knowledge extends regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely-divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion this was likely the first engine to use a lean-burn system to regulate engine speed  output in this manner the engine fired on every power stroke and speed  output was controlled solely by the quantity of fuel injected in 1890 brayton developed and patented a 4 stroke air blast oil engine us patent #432,260 the fuel system delivered a variable quantity of vaporized fuel to the center of the cylinder under pressure at or near the peak of the compression stroke the ignition source was an igniter made from platinum wire a variable quantity injection pump provided the fuel to an injector where it was mixed with air as it entered the cylinder a small crank driven compressor provided the source for air this engine also used the lean burn system diesel originally proposed a very high compression constant temperature cycle where the heat of compression would exceed the heat of combustion however after several years of experiments it was realized that the constant temperature cycle would not work in a piston engine early diesel engines use an air blast system which was pioneered by brayton in 1890 consequently these early engines use the constant pressure cycle  9 just like steam turbines were adopted from steam piston engine so were gas turbines adopted from early piston constant pressure engines early gas turbine history 1791 first patent for a gas turbine john barber united kingdom 1904 unsuccessful gas

switzerland velox burner aerodynamics by stodola modelsedit a brayton-type engine consists of three components modern brayton engines are almost always a turbine type although brayton only made piston engines in the original 19th-century brayton engine ambient air is drawn into a piston compressor where it is compressed ideally an isentropic process the compressed air then runs through a mixing chamber where fuel is added an isobaric process the pressurized air and fuel mixture is then ignited in an expansion cylinder and energy is released causing the heated air and combustion products to expand through a pistoncylinder another ideally isentropic process some of the work extracted by the pistoncylinder is used to drive the compressor through a crankshaft arrangement gas turbines are also brayton engines this also has three components ideal brayton cycle actual brayton cycle since neither the compression nor the expansion can be truly isentropic losses through the compressor and the expander represent sources of inescapable working inefficiencies in general increasing the compression ratio is the most direct way to increase the overall power output of a brayton system 10 the efficiency of the ideal brayton cycle is η  1  t 1 t 2  1   p 1 p 2   γ  1   γ displaystyle eta =1-frac t{1t{2=1-leftfrac p{1p{2rightgamma -1gamma   where γ displaystyle gamma  is the heat capacity ratio 11 figure 1 indicates how the cycle efficiency changes with an increase in pressure ratio figure 2 indicates how the specific power output changes with an increase in the gas turbine inlet temperature for two different pressure ratio values the highest temperature in the cycle occurs at the end of the combustion process and it is limited by the maximum temperature that the turbine blades can withstand this also limits the pressure ratios that can be used in the cycle for a fixed turbine inlet temperature the net work output per cycle increases with the pressure ratio thus the thermal efficiency and the net work output with less work output per cycle a larger mass flow rate thus a larger system is needed to maintain the same power output which may not be economical in most common designs the pressure ratio of a gas turbine ranges from about 11 to 16 12 methods to increase poweredit the power output of a brayton engine can be improved in the following manners reheat wherein the working fluidin most cases airexpands through a series of turbines then is passed through a second combustion chamber before expanding to ambient pressure through a final set of turbines this has the advantage of increasing the power output possible for a given compression ratio without exceeding any metallurgical constraints typically about 1000c the use of an afterburner for jet aircraft engines can also be referred to as reheat it is a different process in that the reheated air is expanded through a thrust nozzle rather than a turbine the metallurgical constraints are somewhat alleviated enabling much higher reheat temperatures about 2000c reheat is most often used to improve the specific power per throughput of air and is usually associated with a drop in efficiency this effect is especially pronounced in afterburners due to the extreme amounts of extra fuel used overspray wherein after a first compressor stage water is injected into the compressor thus increasing the mass-flow inside the compressor increasing the turbine output power significantly and reducing compressor outlet temperatures 13 in a second compressor stage the water is completely converted to a gas form offering some intercooling via its latent heat of vaporization methods to improve efficiencyedit the efficiency of a brayton engine can be improved in the following manners increasing pressure ratio  as figure 1 above shows increasing the pressure ratio increases the efficiency of the brayton cycle this is analogous to the increase of efficiency seen in the otto cycle when the compression ratio is increased however there are practical limits when it comes to increasing the pressure ratio first of all increasing the pressure ratio increases the compressor discharge temperature this can cause the temperature of the gasses leaving the combustor to exceed the metallurgical limits of the turbine also the diameter of the compressor blades becomes progressively smaller in higher pressure stages of the compressor because the gap between the blades and the engine casing increases in size as a percentage of the compressor blade height as the blades get smaller in diameter a greater percentage of the compressed air can leak back past the blades in higher pressure stages this causes a drop in compressor efficiency and is most likely to occur in smaller gas turbines since blades are inherently smaller to begin with finally as can be seen in figure 1 the efficiency levels off as pressure ratio increases hence there is little to gain by increasing the pressure ratio further if it is already at a high level recuperator 14  if the brayton cycle is run at a low pressure ratio and a high temperature increase in the combustion chamber the exhaust gas after the last turbine stage might still be hotter than the compressed inlet gas after the last compression stage but before the combustor in that case a heat exchanger can be used to transfer thermal energy from the exhaust to the already compressed gas before it enters the combustion chamber the thermal energy transferred is effectively re-used thus increasing efficiency however this form of heat recycling is only possible if the engine is run in a low efficiency mode with low pressure ratio in the first place note that transferring heat from the outlet after the last turbine to the inlet before the first compressor stage would reduce efficiency as hotter inlet air means more volume and thus more work for the compressor for engines with liquid cryogenic fuels namely hydrogen it might be feasible though to use the fuel to cool the inlet air before compression to increase efficiency this concept is extensively studied for the sabre engine a brayton engine also forms half of the combined cycle system which combines with a rankine engine to further increase overall efficiency however although this increases overall efficiency it does not actually increase the efficiency of the brayton cycle itself cogeneration systems make use of the waste heat from brayton engines typically for hot water production or space heating variantsedit closed brayton cycleedit a closed brayton cycle recirculates the working fluid the air expelled from the turbine is reintroduced into the compressor this cycle uses a heat exchanger to heat the working fluid instead of an internal combustion chamber the closed brayton cycle is used for example in closed-cycle gas turbine and space power generation solar brayton cycleedit in 2002 a hybrid open solar brayton cycle was operated for the first time consistently and effectively with relevant papers published in the frame of the eu solgate program 15 the air was heated from 570k to over 1000k into the combustor chamber further hybridization was achieved during the eu solhyco project running a hybridized brayton cycle with solar energy and biodiesel only 16 this technology was scaled up to 4.6mw within the project solugas located near seville where it is currently demonstrated at pre-commercial scale 17 reverse brayton cycleedit a brayton cycle that is driven in reverse via net work input and when air is the working fluid is the gas refrigeration cycle or bell coleman cycle its purpose is to move heat rather than produce work this air cooling technique is used widely in jet aircraft for air conditioning systems utilizing air tapped from the engine compressors it is also used in the lng industry where the largest reverse brayton cycle is for subcooling lng using 86 mw of power from a gas turbine driven compressor and nitrogen refrigerant 18 see alsoedit george brayton  inventor selden automobile gerotor heat engine hvac britalus rotary engine referencesedit external linksedit today in science
