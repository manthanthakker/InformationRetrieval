million km  11.7 million squaremiles including adjacent islands it covers six per cent of earths total surface area and 20.4 per cent of its total land area 2 with 1.1 billion people as of 2013 it accounts for about 15 of the worlds human population 1 the continent is surrounded by the mediterranean sea to the north both the suez canal and the red sea along the sinai peninsula to the northeast the indian ocean to the southeast and the atlantic ocean to the west the continent includes madagascar and various archipelagos it contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states countries nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition 3 africas population is the youngest amongst all the continents 4 5 the median age in 2012 was 19.7 when the worldwide median age was 30.4 6 algeria is africas largest country by area and nigeria by population africa particularly central eastern africa is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the hominidae clade great apes as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago including sahelanthropus tchadensis australopithecus africanus a afarensis homo erectus h habilis and h ergaster  with the earliest homo sapiens modern human found in ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago 7 africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones 8 africa hosts a large diversity

its widest sense referred to all lands south of the mediterranean ancient libya 9 10 this name seems to have originally referred to a native libyan tribe see terencebiography for discussion the name is usually connected with hebrew or phoenician ʿafar dust but a 1981 hypothesis 11 has asserted that it stems from the berber ifri plural ifran cave in reference to cave dwellers 12 the same word 12 may be found in the name of the banu ifran from algeria and tripolitania a berber tribe originally from yafran also known as ifrane in northwestern libya 13 under roman rule carthage became the capital of the province of africa proconsularis which also included the coastal part of modern libya 14 the latin suffix -ica can sometimes be used to denote a land eg in celtica from celtae as used by julius caesar the later muslim kingdom of ifriqiya modern-day tunisia also preserved a form of the name according to the romans africa lay to the west of egypt while asia was used to refer to anatolia and lands to the east a definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer ptolemy  85–165 ad indicating alexandria along the prime meridian and making the isthmus of suez and the red sea the boundary between asia and africa as europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent the idea of africa expanded with their knowledge other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name africa the 1st-century jewish historian flavius josephus ant 1.15 asserted that it was named for epher grandson of abraham according to gen 25:4 whose descendants he claimed had invaded libya isidore of seville in etymologiae xiv.5.2 suggests africa comes from the latin aprica meaning sunny massey in 1881 stated that africa is derived from the egyptian af-rui-ka meaning to turn toward the opening of the ka the ka is the energetic double of every person and the opening of the ka refers to a womb or birthplace africa would be for the egyptians the birthplace 15 michèle fruyt proposed 16 linking the latin word with africus south wind which would be of umbrian origin and mean originally rainy wind robert r stieglitz of rutgers university proposed the name africa derived from the latin aphir-ic-a is cognate to hebrew ophir 17 history prehistory africa is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on earth with the human species originating from the continent 18 19 during the mid-20th century anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago bpbefore present fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man such as australopithecus afarensis radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9–3.0million years bp 20 paranthropus boisei c 2.3–1.4million years bp 21 and homo ergaster c 1.9million–600,000 years bp have been discovered 2 after the evolution of homo sapiens sapiens approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years bp in africa the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers 22 23 24 these first modern humans left africa and populated the rest of the globe during the out of africa ii migration dated to approximately 50,000 years bp exiting the continent either across bab-el-mandeb over the red sea 25 26 the strait of gibraltar in morocco 27 or the isthmus of suez in egypt 28 other migrations of modern humans within the african continent have been dated to that time with evidence of early human settlement found in southern africa southeast africa north africa and the sahara 29 the size of the sahara has historically been extremely variable with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climactic conditions 30 at the end of the ice ages estimated to have been around 10,500 bc the sahara had again become a green fertile valley and its african populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in sub-saharan africa with rock art paintings depicting a fertile sahara and large populations discovered in tassili najjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia 31 however the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 bc the sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile around 3500 bc due to a tilt in the earths orbit the sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification 32 the population trekked out of the sahara region towards the nile valley below the second cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements a major climatic recession occurred lessening the heavy and persistent rains in central and eastern africa since this time dry conditions have prevailed in eastern africa and increasingly during the last 200 years in ethiopia the domestication of cattle in africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures it is speculated that by 6000 bc cattle were domesticated in north africa 33 in the sahara-nile complex people domesticated many animals including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from algeria to nubia around 4000 bc the saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace 34 this climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification this in turn decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of west africa 34 by the first millennium bc ironworking had been introduced in northern africa and quickly spread across the sahara into the northern parts of sub-saharan africa 35 and by 500 bc metalworking began to become commonplace in west africa ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 bc in many areas of east and west africa although other regions didnt begin ironworking until the early centuries ad copper objects from egypt north africa nubia and ethiopia dating from around 500 bc have been excavated in west africa suggesting that trans-saharan trade networks had been established by this date 34 early civilizations at about 3300 bc the historical record opens in northern africa with the rise of literacy in the pharaonic civilization of ancient egypt 36 one of the worlds earliest and longest-lasting civilizations the egyptian state continued with varying levels of influence over other areas until 343 bc 37 38 egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day libya and nubia and according to martin bernal as far north as crete 39 an independent centre of civilization with trading links to phoenicia was established by phoenicians from tyre on the north-west african coast at carthage 40 41 42 european exploration of africa began with ancient greeks and romanscitation needed in 332 bc alexander the great was welcomed as a liberator in persian-occupied egypt he founded alexandria in egypt which would become the prosperous capital of the ptolemaic dynasty after his death 43 following the conquest of north africas mediterranean coastline by the roman empire the area was integrated economically and culturally into the roman system roman settlement occurred in modern tunisia and elsewhere along the coast the first roman emperor native to north africa was septimius severus born in leptis magna in present-day libyahis mother was italian roman and his father was punic 44 christianity spread across these areas at an early date from judaea via egypt and beyond the borders of the roman world into nubia 45 by ad 340 at the latest it had become the state religion of the aksumite empire syro-greek missionaries who arrived by way of the red sea were responsible for this theological development 46 in the early 7th century the newly formed arabian islamic caliphate expanded into egypt and then into north africa in a short while the local berber elite had been integrated into muslim arab tribes when the umayyad capital damascus fell in the 8th century the islamic centre of the mediterranean shifted from syria to qayrawan in north africa islamic north africa had become diverse and a hub for mystics scholars jurists and philosophers during the above-mentioned period islam spread to sub-saharan africa mainly through trade routes and migration 47 ninth to eighteenth centuries pre-colonial africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities 49 characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule these included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the san people of southern africa larger more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the bantu-speaking peoples of central southern and eastern africa heavily structured clan groups in the horn of africa the large sahelian kingdoms and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the akan edo yoruba and igbo people in west africa and the swahili coastal trading towns of southeast africa by the ninth century ad a string of dynastic states including the earliest hausa states stretched across the sub-saharan savannah from the western regions to central sudan the most powerful of these states were ghana gao and the kanem-bornu empire ghana declined in the eleventh century but was succeeded by the mali empire which consolidated much of western sudan in the thirteenth century kanem accepted islam in the eleventh century in the forested regions of the west african coast independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the muslim north the kingdom of nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first it is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day nigeria and was ruled by the eze nri the nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes found at the town of igbo-ukwu the bronzes have been dated from as far back as the ninth century 50 the kingdom of ife historically the first of these yoruba city-states or kingdoms established government under a priestly oba king or ruler in the yoruba language called the ooni of ife ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in west africa and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture the ife model of government was adapted at the oyo empire where its obas or kings called the alaafins of oyo once controlled a large number of other yoruba and non-yoruba city-states and kingdoms the fon kingdom of dahomey was one of the non-yoruba domains under oyo control the almoravids were a berber dynasty from the sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern africa and the iberian peninsula during the eleventh century 51 the banu hilal and banu maqil were a collection of arab bedouin tribes from the arabian peninsula who migrated westwards via egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries their migration resulted in the fusion of the arabs and berbers where the locals were arabized 52 and arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture under the unifying framework of islam 53 following the breakup of mali a local leader named sonni ali  1464–1492 founded the songhai empire in the region of middle niger and the western sudan and took control of the trans-saharan trade sonni ali seized timbuktu in 1468 and jenne in 1473 building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of muslim merchants his successor askia mohammad i  1493–1528 made islam the official religion built mosques and brought to gao muslim scholars including al-maghili d.1504 the founder of an important tradition of sudanic african muslim scholarship 54 by the eleventh century some hausa states  such as kano jigawa katsina and gobir  had developed into walled towns engaging in trade servicing caravans and the manufacture of goods until the fifteenth century these small states were on the periphery of the major sudanic empires of the era paying tribute to songhai to the west and kanem-borno to the east height of slave trade slavery had long been practised in africa 55 56 between the 7th and 20th centuries arab slave trade also known as slavery in the east took 18 million slaves from africa via trans-saharan and indian ocean routes between the 15th and the 19th centuries  500 years the atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the new world 57 58 59 more than 1 million europeans were captured by barbary pirates and sold as slaves in north africa between the 16th and 19th centuries 60 in west africa the decline of the atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities the gradual decline of slave-trading prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the new world increasing anti-slavery legislation in europe and america and the british royal navys increasing presence off the west african coast obliged african states to adopt new economies between 1808 and 1860 the british west africa squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 africans who were aboard 61 action was also taken against african leaders who refused to agree to british treaties to outlaw the trade for example against the usurping king of lagos deposed in 1851 anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 african rulers 62 the largest powers of west africa the asante confederacy the kingdom of dahomey and the oyo empire adopted different ways of adapting to the shift asante and dahomey concentrated on the development of legitimate commerce in the form of palm oil cocoa timber and gold forming the bedrock of west africas modern export trade the oyo empire unable to adapt collapsed into civil wars 63 colonialism and the scramble for africa in the late 19th century the european imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent creating many colonial territories and leaving only two fully independent states ethiopia known to europeans as abyssinia and liberia egypt and sudan were never formally incorporated into any european colonial empire however after the british occupation of 1882 egypt was effectively under british administration until 1922 berlin conference the berlin conference held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of african ethnic groups it was convened by king leopold ii of belgium and attended by the european powers that laid claim to african territories it sought to end the european powers scramble for africa by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence they set up the political divisions of the continent by spheres of interest that exist in africa today independence struggles imperial rule by europeans would continue until after the conclusion of world war ii when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence independence movements in africa gained momentum following world war ii which left the major european powers weakened in 1951 libya a former italian colony gained independence in 1956 tunisia and morocco won their independence from france 64 ghana followed suit the next year march 1957 65 becoming the first of the sub-saharan colonies to be granted independence most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade portugals overseas presence in sub-saharan africa most notably in angola cape verde mozambique guinea-bissau and são tomé and príncipe lasted from the 16th century to 1975 after the estado novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in lisbon rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the united kingdom in 1965 under the white minority government of ian smith but was not internationally recognized as an independent state as zimbabwe until 1980 when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war although south africa was one of the first african countries to gain independence the state remained under the control of the countrys white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994 post-colonial africa today africa contains 54 sovereign countries most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of european colonialism since colonialism african states have frequently been hampered by instability corruption violence and authoritarianism the vast majority of african states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule however few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis and many have instead cycled through a series of coups producing military dictatorships great instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups and graft under these leaders for political gain many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts some of which had been exacerbated or even created by colonial rule in many countries the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order and it ruled many nations in africa during the 1970s and early 1980s during the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations border and territorial disputes were also common with the european-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts cold war conflicts between the united states and the soviet union as well as the policies of the international monetary fundcitation needed also played a role in instability when a country became independent for the first time it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers many countries in northern africa received soviet military aid while others in central and southern africa were supported by the united states france or both the 1970s saw an escalation of cold war intrigues as newly independent angola and mozambique aligned themselves with the soviet union and the west and south africa sought to contain soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements in rhodesia soviet and chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the zimbabwe patriotic front waged a brutal guerrilla war against the countrys white government there was a major famine in ethiopia when hundreds of thousands of people starved some claimed that marxist economic policies made the situation worse 66 67 68 the most devastating military conflict in modern independent africa has been the second congo war this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 5.5 million people 69 since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster another notable tragic event is the 1994 rwandan genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered aids in post-colonial africa has also been a prevalent issue in the 21st century however the number of armed conflicts in africa has steadily declined for instance the civil war in angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years this has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms the improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many african nations mainly from china 70 which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline several african economies are among the worlds fastest growing as of 2016 a significant part of this growth which is sometimes referred to as africa rising can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone 71 geography africa is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest landmass of the earth separated from europe by the mediterranean sea it is joined to asia at its northeast extremity by the isthmus of suez transected by the suez canal 163km  101mi wide 72 geopolitically egypts sinai peninsula east of the suez canal is often considered part of africa as well 73 from the most northerly point ras ben sakka in tunisia  37°21 n to the most southerly point cape agulhas in south africa  34°51'15 s is a distance of approximately 8,000km  5,000mi 74 from cape verde 17°33'22 w the westernmost point to ras hafun in somalia 51°27'52 e the most easterly projection is a distance of approximately 7,400km  4,600mi 75 the coastline is 26,000km  16,000mi long and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is illustrated by the fact that europe which covers only 10,400,000km2  4,000,000sqmi  about a third of the surface of africa  has a coastline of 32,000km  20,000mi 75 africas largest country is algeria and its smallest country is the seychelles an archipelago off the east coast 76 the smallest nation on the continental mainland is the gambia geologically africa includes the arabian peninsula the zagros mountains of iran and the anatolian plateau of turkey mark where the african plate collided with eurasia the afrotropic ecozone and the saharo-arabian desert to its north unite the region biogeographically and the afro-asiatic language family unites the north linguistically climate the climate of africa ranges from tropical to subarctic on its highest peaks its northern half is primarily desert or arid while its central and southern areas contain both savanna plains and dense jungle rainforest regions in between there is a convergence where vegetation patterns such as sahel and steppe dominate africa is the hottest continent on earth and 60 of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts 77 the record for the highest-ever recorded temperature in libya in 1922  58c  136f was discredited in 2013 78 79 fauna africa boasts perhaps the worlds largest combination of density and range of freedom of wild animal populations and diversity with wild populations of large carnivores such as lions hyenas and cheetahs and herbivores such as buffalo elephants camels and giraffes ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains it is also home to a variety of jungle animals including snakes and primates and aquatic life such as crocodiles and amphibians in addition africa has the largest number of megafauna species as it was least affected by the extinction of the pleistocene megafauna ecology and biodiversity africa has over 3,000 protected areas with 198 marine protected areas 50 biosphere reserves and 80 wetlands reserves significant habitat destruction increases in human population and poaching are reducing africas biological diversity and arable land human encroachment civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in africa this has been exacerbated by administrative problems inadequate personnel and funding problems 77 deforestation is affecting africa at twice the world rate according to the united nations environment programme unep 80 according to the university of pennsylvania african studies center 31 of africas pasture lands and 19 of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded and africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world 77 some sources claim that approximately 90 of the original virgin forests in west africa have been destroyed 81 over 90 of madagascars original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago 82 about 65 of africas agricultural land suffers from soil degradation 83 politics there are clear signs of increased networking among african organizations and states for example in the civil war in the democratic republic of the congo former zaire rather than rich non-african countries intervening neighbouring african countries became involved see also second congo war since the conflict began in 1998 the estimated death toll has reached 5 million the african union the african union au is a 54-member federation consisting of all of africas states except morocco the union was formed with addis ababa ethiopia as its headquarters on 26 june 2001 the union was officially established on 9 july 2002 84 as a successor to the organisation of african unity oau in july 2004 the african unions pan-african parliament pap was relocated to midrand in south africa but the african commission on human and peoples rights remained in addis ababa there is a policy in effect to decentralize the african federations institutions so that they are shared by all the states the african union not to be confused with the au commission is formed by the constitutive act of the african union which aims to transform the african economic community a federated commonwealth into a state under established international conventions the african union has a parliamentary government known as the african union government consisting of legislative judicial and executive organs it is led by the african union president and head of state who is also the president of the pan-african parliament a person becomes au president by being elected to the pap and subsequently gaining majority support in the pap the powers and authority of the president of the african parliament derive from the constitutive act and the protocol of the pan-african parliament as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by african treaties and by international treaties including those subordinating the secretary general of the oau secretariat au commission to the pap the government of the au consists of all-union federal regional state and municipal authorities as well as hundreds of institutions that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution political associations such as the african union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continents many countries extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of africa often under the oversight of the state most of such violations occur for political reasons often as a side effect of civil war countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the democratic republic of the congo sierra leone liberia sudan zimbabwe and côte divoire economy although it has abundant natural resources africa remains the worlds poorest and most underdeveloped continent the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations failed central planning high levels of illiteracy lack of access to foreign capital and frequent tribal and military conflict ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide 85 according to the united nations human development report in 2003 the bottom 24 ranked nations  151st to 175th were all african 86 poverty illiteracy malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation as well as poor health affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the african continent in august 2008 the world bank 87 announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day versus the previous measure of $1.00 80.5 of the sub-saharan africa population was living on less than $2.50 ppp per day in 2005 compared with 85.7 for india 88 sub-saharan africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty $1.25 per day some 50 of the population living in poverty in 1981  200 million people a figure that rose to 58 in 1996 before dropping to 50 in 2005  380 million people the average poor person in sub-saharan africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973 89 indicating increasing poverty in some areas some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors 90 91 92 from 1995 to 2005 africas rate of economic growth increased averaging 5 in 2005 some countries experienced still higher growth rates notably angola sudan and equatorial guinea all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity the continent is believed to hold 90 of the worlds cobalt 90 of its platinum 50 of its gold 98 of its chromium 70 of its tantalite 93 64 of its manganese and one-third of its uranium 94 the democratic republic of the congo drc has 70 of the worlds coltan a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones the drc also has more than 30 of the worlds diamond reserves 95 guinea is the worlds largest exporter of bauxite 96 as the growth in africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels in fact the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis has pushed back 100 million people into food insecurity 97 in recent years the peoples republic of china has built increasingly stronger ties with african nations and is africas largest trading partner in 2007 chinese companies invested a total of us$1 billion in africa 70 a harvard university study led by professor calestous juma showed that africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency african agriculture is at the crossroads we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured africas export of raw materials and importation of food africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity 98 during us president barack obamas visit to africa in july 2013 he announced a us$7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with african heads of state he also announced a new programme named trade africa designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between africa and the us 99 demographics africas population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years and consequently it is relatively young in some african states more than half the population is under 25 years of age 100 the total number of people in africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990 101 as of 2014 the population of africa is estimated at 1.2 billion 102 africas total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent african population surpassed europe in the 1990s while the americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000 africas rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population at roughly the same time - india and chinas 1.4 billion people each will swap ranking around the year 2022 103 speakers of bantu languages part of the nigercongo family are the majority in southern central and southeast africa the bantu-speaking peoples from the sahel progressively expanded over most of sub-saharan africa 104 but there are also several nilotic groups in south sudan and east africa the mixed swahili people on the swahili coast and a few remaining indigenous khoisan san or bushmen and pygmy peoples in southern and central africa respectively bantu-speaking africans also predominate in gabon and equatorial guinea and are found in parts of southern cameroon in the kalahari desert of southern africa the distinct people known as the bushmen also san closely related to but distinct from hottentots have long been present the san are physically distinct from other africans and are the indigenous people of southern africa pygmies are the pre-bantu indigenous peoples of central africa 105 the peoples of west africa primarily speak nigercongo languages belonging mostly to its non-bantu branches though some nilo-saharan and afro-asiatic speaking groups are also found the nigercongo-speaking yoruba igbo fulani akan and wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential in the central sahara mandinka or mande groups are most significant chadic-speaking groups including the hausa are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the sahara and nilo-saharan communities such as the songhai kanuri and zarma are found in the eastern parts of west africa bordering central africa the peoples of north africa consist of three main indigenous groups berbers in the northwest egyptians in the northeast and nilo-saharan-speaking peoples in the east the arabs who arrived in the 7th century ad introduced the arabic language and islam to north africa the semitic phoenicians who founded carthage and hyksos the indo-iranian alans the indo- european greeks romans and vandals settled in north africa as well significant berber communities remain within morocco and algeria in the 21st century while to a lesser extent berber speakers are also present in some regions of tunisia and libya 106 the berber-speaking tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the saharan interior of north africa in mauritania there is a small but near-extinct berber community in the north and nigercongo-speaking peoples in the south though in both regions arabic and arab culture predominates in sudan although arabic and arab culture predominate it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke nilo-saharan such as the nubians fur masalit and zaghawa who over the centuries have variously intermixed with migrants from the arabian peninsula small communities of afro-asiatic-speaking beja nomads can also be found in egypt and sudancitation needed in the horn of africa some ethiopian and eritrean groups like the amhara and tigrayans collectively known as habesha speak languages from the semitic branch of the afro-asiatic language family while the oromo and somali speak languages from the cushitic branch of afro-asiatic prior to the decolonization movements of the post-world war ii era europeans were represented in every part of africa 107 decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers  especially from algeria and morocco  1.6 million pieds-noirs in north africa 108 kenya congo 109 rhodesia mozambique and angola 110 between 1975 and 1977 over a million colonials returned to portugal alone 111 nevertheless white africans remain an important minority in many african states particularly zimbabwe namibia réunion and the republic of south africa 112 the country with the largest white african population is south africa 113 dutch and british diasporas represent the largest communities of european ancestry on the continent today 114 european colonization also brought sizable groups of asians particularly from the indian subcontinent to british colonies large indian communities are found in south africa and smaller ones are present in kenya tanzania and some other southern and southeast african countries the large indian community in uganda was expelled by the dictator idi amin in 1972 though many have since returned the islands in the indian ocean are also populated primarily by people of asian origin often mixed with africans and europeans the malagasy people of madagascar are an austronesian people but those along the coast are generally mixed with bantu arab indian and european origins malay and indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in south africa as cape coloureds people with origins in two or more races and continents during the 20th century small but economically important communities of lebanese and chinese 70 have also developed in the larger coastal cities of west and east africa respectively 115 languages by most estimates well over a thousand languages unesco has estimated around two thousand are spoken in africa 116 most are of african origin though some are of european or asian origin africa is the most multilingual continent in the world and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple african languages but one or more european ones as well there are four major language families indigenous to africa the afroasiatic languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the horn of africa north africa the sahel and southwest asia the nilo-saharan language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people nilo-saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in chad ethiopia kenya nigeria sudan south sudan uganda and northern tanzania the nigercongo language family covers much of sub-saharan africa and is probably the largest language family in the world in terms of different languages the khoisan languages number about fifty and are spoken in southern africa by approximately 120,000 people many of the khoisan languages are endangered the khoi and san peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of africa following the end of colonialism nearly all african countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages such as swahili yoruba igbo and hausa in numerous countries english and french see african french are used for communication in the public sphere such as government commerce education and the media arabic portuguese afrikaans and spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of africa and that are used by millions of africans today both in the public and private spheres italian is spoken by some in former italian colonies in africa german is spoken in namibia as it was a former german protectorate culture some aspects of traditional african cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes for example african customs were discouraged and african languages were prohibited in mission schools 117 leopold ii of belgium attempted to civilize africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft 117 obidoh freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern african art 118 according to authors douglas fraser and herbert m cole the precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art  119 fraser and cole assert that in igboland some art objects lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions 119 author chika okeke-agulu states that the racist infrastructure of british imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign africa and modernist art  120 in soweto the west rand administrative board established a cultural section to collect read and review scripts before performances could occur 121 editors f abiola irele and simon gikandi comment that the current identity of african literature had its genesis in the traumatic encounter between africa and europe  122 on the other hand mhoze chikowero believes that africans deployed music dance spirituality and other performative cultures to reasset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies  123 there is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue african traditional cultures under such movements as the african renaissance led by thabo mbeki afrocentrism led by a group of scholars including molefi asante as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of vodou and other forms of spirituality visual art and architecture african art and architecture reflect the diversity of african cultures the regions oldest known beads were made from nassarius shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago 124 the great pyramid of giza in egypt was the worlds tallest structure for 4,000 years until the completion of lincoln cathedral around the year 1300 the stone ruins of great zimbabwe are also noteworthy for their architecture as are the monolithic churches at lalibela ethiopia such as the church of saint george music and dance egypt has long been a cultural focus of the arab world while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-saharan africa in particular west africa was transmitted through the atlantic slave trade to modern samba blues jazz reggae hip hop and rock the 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of afrobeat and highlife music modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of soukous dominated by the music of the democratic republic of congo indigenous musical and dance traditions of africa are maintained by oral traditions and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of north africa and southern africa arab influences are visible in north african music and dance and in southern africa western influences are apparent due to colonization sports fifty-four african countries have football soccer teams in the confederation of african football egypt has won the african cup seven times and a record-making three times in a row cameroon nigeria senegal ghana and algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent fifa world cups south africa hosted the 2010 world cup tournament becoming the first african country to do so

hosted the 2002 morocco cup but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament rugby is a popular sport in south africa namibia and zimbabwe religion africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are often a sensitive a topic for governments with mixed religious populations 125 126 according to the world book encyclopedia islam is the largest religion in africa followed by christianity according to encyclopedia britannica 45 of the population are christians 40 are muslims and 10 follow
