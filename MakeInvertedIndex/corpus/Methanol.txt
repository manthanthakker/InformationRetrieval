formula ch3oh often abbreviated meoh methanol acquired the name wood alcohol because it was once produced chiefly as a byproduct of the destructive distillation of wood today industrial methanol is produced in a catalytic process directly from carbon monoxide carbon dioxide and hydrogen methanol is the simplest alcohol being only a methyl group linked to a hydroxyl group it is a light volatile colorless flammable liquid with a distinctive odor very similar to that of ethanol drinking alcohol 11 however unlike ethanol methanol is highly toxic and unfit for consumption at room temperature it is a polar liquid and is used as an antifreeze solvent fuel and as a denaturant for ethanol it is also used for producing biodiesel via transesterification reaction methanol is produced naturally in the anaerobic metabolism of many varieties of bacteria and is commonly present in small amounts in the environment as a result the atmosphere contains a small amount of methanol vapor but in only a few days atmospheric methanol is oxidized by sunlight to produce carbon dioxide and water methanol is also found in abundant quantities in star forming regions of space and is used in astronomy as a marker for such regions it is detected through its spectral emission lines 12 methanol when drunk is metabolized first to formaldehyde and then to formic acid or formate salts 13 these are poisonous to the central nervous system and may result in blindness coma and death because of these toxic properties methanol is frequently used as a denaturant additive for ethanol manufactured for industrial uses this addition of methanol exempts industrial ethanol commonly known as denatured alcohol or methylated spirit from liquor excise taxation in the us and some other countries contents 1 toxicity 2

symptoms may include a decreased level of consciousness poor coordination vomiting abdominal pain and a specific smell on the breath 15 14 decreased vision may start as early as twelve hours after exposure 15 long term outcomes may include blindness and kidney failure toxicity and death may occur even after drinking a small amount 14 methanol poisoning most commonly occurs following the drinking of windshield washer fluid 15 this may be accidental or done purposefully in an attempt to cause death toxicity may also rarely occur through skin exposure or breathing in the fumes 14 when methanol is broken down by the body it results in formaldehyde formic acid and formate which cause much of the toxicity 15 the diagnosis may be suspected when there is acidosis or an increased osmol gap and confirmed by directly measuring blood levels 15 14 other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include infections exposure to other toxic alcohols serotonin syndrome and diabetic ketoacidosis 15 early treatment increases the chance of a good outcome treatment consists of stabilizing the person followed by the use of an antidote the prefered antidote is fomepizole with ethanol used if this is not avaliable hemodialysis may also be used in those where there is organ damage or a high degree of acidosis other treatments may include sodium bicarbonate folate and thiamine 15 outbreaks have occurred due to contamination of drinking alcohol this is more common in the developing world 15 in 2013 more than 1700 cases occurred in the united states those affected are often adults and male 16 outcomes may be good with early treatment 14 toxicity to methanol has been described as early as 1856 17 applicationsedit methanol is used primarily as a feedstock for the manufacture of chemicals and as a fuel for specialized vehicles as mentioned above it is a common de-naturing agent as a common laboratory solvent is especially useful for hplc uvvis spectroscopy and lcms due to its low uv cutoff chemical industryedit methanol is primarily used in making other chemicals about 40 of methanol is converted to formaldehyde and from there into products as diverse as plastics plywood paints explosives and permanent press textiles in the early 1970s a process was developed by mobil for producing gasoline fuel for vehicles one such industrial facility was built at motunui in new zealand in the 1980s in the 1990s large amounts of methanol were used in the united states to produce the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether mtbe while mtbe is no longer marketed in the us it is still widely used in other parts of the world methanol or less commonly ethanol is a component in the transesterification of triglycerides for production of biodiesel other chemical derivatives of methanol include dimethyl ether dme which has replaced chlorofluorocarbons as an aerosol spray propellant and acetic acid dimethyl ether can be blended with liquified petroleum gas lpg for home heating and cooking and can be used as a replacement for transportation diesel fuel of high interest to the petrochemical marketplace methanol is an important ingredient in new and lower-cost methods for producing propylene which is much in demand such methods include methanol-to-olefins mto methanol-to-propylene mtomtp metathesis propane dehydrogenation pdh high severity fcc and olefins cracking the market for proponyl became tight when the ethane prices fell in the usa with the exploration of shale gas reserves the low priced ethylene produced from this raw material has given chemical producers in north america a feedstock advantage such change has put naphtha-fed steam crackers at a disadvantageous position with many of them shutting down or revamping to use ethane as feedstock nevertheless the propylene output rates from ethane-fed crackers are negligible 18 fuel for vehiclesedit methanol is occasionally used to fuel internal combustion engines pure methanol is required by rule to be used in champcars monster trucks usac sprint cars as well as midgets modifieds etc and other dirt track series such as world of outlaws and motorcycle speedway mainly because in the event of an accident methanol does not produce an opaque cloud of smoke since the late 1940s methanol is also used as the primary fuel ingredient in the powerplants for radio control control line free flight airplanes cars and trucks such engines use a platinum filament glow plug that ignites the methanol vapor through a catalytic reaction drag racers mud racers and heavily modified tractor pullers also use methanol as the primary fuel source methanol is required with a supercharged engine in a top alcohol dragster and until the end of the 2006 season all vehicles in the indianapolis 500 had to run on methanol as a fuel for mud racers methanol mixed with gasoline and nitrous oxide produces more power than gasoline and nitrous oxide alone methanol burns in oxygen including open air forming carbon dioxide and water one problem with high concentrations of methanol in fuel is that alcohols corrode some metals particularly aluminium an acid albeit weak methanol attacks the oxide coating that normally protects the aluminum from corrosion the resulting methoxide salts are soluble in methanol resulting in a clean aluminium surface which is readily oxidized by dissolved oxygen also the methanol can act as an oxidizer this reciprocal process effectively fuels corrosion until either the metal is eaten away or the concentration of ch3oh is negligible methanols corrosivity has been addressed with methanol-compatible materials and fuel additives that serve as corrosion inhibitors organic methanol produced from wood or other organic materials bioalcohol has been suggested as a renewable alternative to petroleum-based hydrocarbons low levels of methanol can be used in existing vehicles with the addition of cosolvents and corrosion inhibitors methanol fuel has been proposed for ground transportation the chief advantage of a methanol economy is that it could be adapted to gasoline internal combustion engines with minimum modification to the engines and to the infrastructure that delivers and stores liquid fuel safety in automotive fuelsedit pure methanol has been used in open wheel auto racing since the mid-1960s unlike petroleum fires methanol fires can be extinguished with plain water a methanol-based fire burns invisibly unlike gasoline which burns with a visible flame if a fire occurs on the track there is no flame or smoke to obstruct the view of fast approaching drivers but this can also delay visual detection of the fire and the initiation of fire suppression the decision to permanently switch to methanol in american indycar racing was a result of the devastating crash and explosion at the 1964 indianapolis 500 which killed drivers eddie sachs and dave macdonald 19 in 2007 indycars switched from methanol to ethanol 20 government policyedit the european fuel quality directive allows up to 3 methanol with an equal amount of cosolvent to be blended with gasoline sold in europe china uses more than one billion gallons of methanol per year as a transportation fuel in low level blends for conventional vehicles and high level blends in vehicles designed for methanol fuels in the us the open fuel standard act of 2011 was introduced in the us congress to encourage car manufacturers to build cars capable of using methanol gasoline or ethanol fuels the bill is being championed by the open fuel standard coalition production of synthesis gasedit stoichiometry for methanol production of syngas requires the ratio of h2  co to equal 2 the partial oxidation process yields a ratio of 2 and the steam reforming process yields a ratio of 3 the h2  co ratio can be lowered to some extent by the reverse water-gas shift reaction to provide the appropriate stoichiometry for methanol synthesis energy carrieredit methanol is useful as an energy carrier because it is easier to store than hydrogen and burns cleaner than fossil fuels methanol is readily biodegradable in both aerobic oxygen present and anaerobic oxygen absent environments methanol will not persist in the environment the half-life for methanol in groundwater is just one to seven days while many common gasoline components have half-lives in the hundreds of days such as benzene at 10–730 days since methanol is miscible with water and biodegradable it is unlikely to accumulate in groundwater surface water air or soil 21 other applicationsedit methanol is a traditional denaturant for ethanol the product being known as denatured alcohol or methylated spirit this was commonly used during the prohibition to discourage consumption of bootlegged liquor and ended up causing several deaths 22 methanol is used as a solvent and as an antifreeze in pipelines and windshield washer fluid in some wastewater treatment plants a small amount of methanol is added to wastewater to provide a carbon food source for the denitrifying bacteria which convert nitrates to nitrogen gas and reduce the nitrification of sensitive aquifers during world war ii methanol was used as a fuel in several german military rocket designs under the name m-stoff and in a roughly 50/50 mixture with hydrazine known as c-stoff methanol was used as an automobile coolant antifreeze in the early 1900s 23 methanol is used as a destaining agent in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis direct-methanol fuel cells are unique in their low temperature atmospheric pressure operation allowing them to be miniaturized to an unprecedented degree 24 25 this combined with the relatively easy and safe storage and handling of methanol may open the possibility of fuel cell-powered consumer electronics such as laptop computers and mobile phones 26 methanol is also a widely used fuel in camping and boating stoves methanol burns well in an unpressurized burner so alcohol stoves are often very simple sometimes little more than a cup to hold fuel this lack of complexity makes them a favorite of hikers who spend extended time in the wilderness similarly the alcohol can be gelled to reduce risk of leaking or spilling as with the brand sterno methanol is mixed with water and injected into high performance diesel and gasoline engines for an increase of power and a decrease in intake air temperature in a process known as water methanol injection productionedit human metaboliteedit small amounts of methanol is a natural endogenous compound found in normal healthy humans a study found a mean of 4.5ppm in the exhaled breath of subjects 27 the mean endogenous methanol production in humans of 0.45gd may be metabolized from pectin found in fruit one kilogram of apple produces up to 1.4g methanol 28 from synthesis gasedit carbon monoxide and hydrogen react over a catalyst to produce methanol today the most widely used catalyst is a mixture of copper and zinc oxides supported on alumina as first used by ici in 1966 at 5–10 mpa  50–100atm and 250c  482f the reaction is characterized by high selectivity >99.8 since the production of synthesis gas from methane produces three moles of hydrogen for every mole of carbon monoxide whereas the synthesis consumes only two moles of hydrogen gas per mole of carbon monoxide one way of dealing with the excess hydrogen is to inject carbon dioxide into the methanol synthesis reactor where it too reacts to form methanol according to the equation in terms of mechanism the process occurs via initial conversion of co into co2 which is then hydrogenated 29 where the h2o byproduct is recycled via the water-gas shift reaction this gives an overall reaction which is the same as listed above otheredit the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol has long been sought as a route to methanol this route is effected by enzymes such as methane monooxygenases but commercial routes remain elusive because of the tendency for over-oxidation ie methanol is more readily oxidized than is methane 30 31 quality specifications and analysisedit laboratory useedit methanol is available commercially in various purity grades for fine chemicals synthesis quality corresponding to normal commercial methanol certified analytical quality extremely pure qualities for semiconductor manufacture commercial methanoledit in addition to laboratory grades commercial methanol is generally classified according to astm purity grades a and aa methanol for chemical use normally corresponds to grade aa in addition to water typical impurities include acetone and ethanol which are very difficult to separate by distillation when methanol is delivered by ships or tankers used to transport other substances contamination by the previous cargo must be expected comparative ultraviolet spectroscopy has proved a convenient quick test method for deciding whether a batch can be accepted and loaded traces of all chemicals derived from aromatic parent substances as well as a large number of other compounds can be detected further tests for establishing the quality of methanol include measurements of boiling point range density permanganate number turbidity color index and acid number more comprehensive tests include water determination according to the karl fischer method and gas chromatographic determination of byproducts however the latter is relatively expensive and time-consuming because several injections using different columns and detectors must be made due to the variety of byproducts present historyedit in their embalming process the ancient egyptians used a mixture of substances including methanol which they obtained from the pyrolysis of wood pure methanol however was first isolated in 1661 by robert boyle when he produced it via the distillation of buxus boxwood 32 it later became known as pyroxylic spirit in 1834 the french chemists jean-baptiste dumas and eugene peligot determined its elemental composition 33 they also introduced the word methylene to organic chemistry forming it from greek methy  alcoholic liquid  hȳlē  wood patch of trees with greek language errors wood substance greek ξύλον xylon was intended and the components are in the wrong order for greek the term methyl was derived in about 1840 by back-formation from methylene and was then applied to describe methyl alcohol this was shortened to methanol in 1892 by the international conference on chemical nomenclature 34 the suffix -yl used in organic chemistry to form names of carbon groups was extracted from the word methyl in 1923 the german chemists alwin mittasch and mathias pier working for badische-anilin  soda-fabrikbasf developed a means to convert synthesis gas a mixture of carbon monoxide carbon dioxide and hydrogen into methanol us patent 1,569,775 was applied for on 4 sep 1924 and issued on 12 january 1926 the process used a chromium and manganese oxide catalyst with extremely vigorous conditionspressures ranging from 50 to 220 atm and temperatures up to 450c modern methanol production has been made more efficient through use of catalysts commonly copper capable of operating at lower pressures the modern low pressure methanol lpm was developed by ici in the late 1960s us 3326956 with the technology now owned by johnson matthey which is a leading licensor of methanol technology methanol is one of the most heavily traded chemical commodities in the world with an estimated global demand of around 27 to 29 million metric tons in recent years production capacity has expanded considerably with new plants coming on-stream in south america china and the middle east the latter based on access to abundant supplies of methane gas even though nameplate production capacity coal-based in china has grown significantly operating rates are estimated to be as low as 50 to 60 no new production capacity is scheduled to come on-stream until 2015 the main applications for methanol are the production of formaldehyde used in construction and wooden boarding acetic acid basis for ao pet-bottles mtbe fuel component and replacement for the very volatile diethyl ether and more recently for the formation of methyl esters in the production of bio-diesel in china demand is expected to grow exponentially not only caused by a growing internal market of the traditional applications but accelerated by new applications such as direct blending with gasoline methanol-to-olefins eg propylene and dme methanol can also be used to produce gasoline the use of methanol as a motor fuel received attention during the oil crises of the 1970s due to its availability low cost and environmental benefits by the mid-1990s over 20,000 methanol flexible fuel vehicles capable of operating on methanol or gasoline were introduced in the us in addition low levels of methanol were blended in gasoline fuels sold in europe during much of the 1980s and early-1990s automakers stopped building methanol ffvs by the late-1990s switching their attention to ethanol-fueled vehicles while the methanol ffv program was a technical success rising methanol pricing in the mid- to late-1990s during a period of slumping gasoline pump prices diminished the interest in methanol fuels 36 in 2006 astronomers using the merlin array of radio telescopes at jodrell bank observatory discovered a large cloud of methanol in space 288 billion miles across 37 38 in 2016 astronomers detected methyl alcohol in a planet-forming disc around the young star tw
