elements with atomic numbers from 89 to 103 actinium through lawrencium 2 3 4 5 the actinide series derives its name from the first element in the series actinium the informal chemical symbol an is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide all but one of the actinides are f-block elements corresponding to the filling of the 5f electron shell lawrencium a d-block element is also generally considered an actinide in comparison with the lanthanides also mostly f-block elements the actinides show much more variable valence they all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties while actinium and the late actinides from americium onwards behave similarly to the lanthanides the elements thorium through neptunium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry all actinides are radioactive and release energy upon radioactive decay naturally occurring uranium and thorium and synthetically produced plutonium are the most abundant actinides on earth these are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses and americium is used in the ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors of the actinides primordial thorium and uranium occur naturally in substantial quantities the radioactive decay of uranium produces transient amounts of actinium and protactinium and atoms of neptunium and plutonium are occasionally produced from transmutation reactions in uranium ores the other actinides are purely synthetic elements 2 6 nuclear weapons tests have released at least six actinides heavier than plutonium into the environment analysis of debris from a 1952 hydrogen bomb explosion showed the presence of americium curium berkelium californium einsteinium and fermium 7 in presentations of the periodic table the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table 2 with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series either lanthanum or lutetium and either actinium or lawrencium respectively shown in a single cell of the main

transuranium elements which follow uranium in the periodic tableand transplutonium elements which follow plutonium compared to the lanthanides which except for promethium are found in nature in appreciable quantities most actinides are rare the most abundant or easily synthesized actinides are uranium and thorium followed by plutonium americium actinium protactinium and neptunium 10 the existence of transuranium elements was suggested by enrico fermi based on his experiments in 1934 11 12 however even though four actinides were known by that time it was not yet understood that they formed a family similar to lanthanides the prevailing view that dominated early research into transuranics was that they were regular elements in the 7th period with thorium protactinium and uranium corresponding to 6th-period hafnium tantalum and tungsten respectively synthesis of transuranics gradually undermined this point of view by 1944 an observation that curium failed to exhibit oxidation states above 4 whereas its supposed 6th period homolog platinum can reach oxidation state of 6 prompted glenn seaborg to formulate a so-called actinide hypothesis studies of known actinides and discoveries of further transuranic elements provided more data in support of this point of view but the phrase actinide hypothesis the implication being that hypothesis is something that has not been decisively proven remained in active use by scientists through the late 1950s 13 14 at present there are two major methods of producing isotopes of transplutonium elements irradiation of the lighter elements with either neutrons or accelerated charged particles the first method is most important for applications as only neutron irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides however it is limited to relatively light elements the advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium as well as neutron-deficient isotopes can be obtained which are not formed during neutron irradiation 15 in 1962–1966 there were attempts in the united states to produce transplutonium isotopes using a series of six underground nuclear explosions small samples of rock were extracted from the blast area immediately after the test to study the explosion products but no isotopes with mass number greater than 257 could be detected despite predictions that such isotopes would have relatively long half-lives of α-decay this inobservation was attributed to spontaneous fission owing to the large speed of the products and to other decay channels such as neutron emission and nuclear fission 16 from actinium to uraniumedit uranium and thorium were the first actinides discovered uranium was identified in 1789 by the german chemist martin heinrich klaproth in pitchblende ore he named it after the planet uranus 6 which had been discovered only eight years earlier klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound likely sodium diuranate by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide he then reduced the obtained yellow powder with charcoal and extracted a black substance that he mistook for metal 17 only 60 years later the french scientist eugène-melchior péligot identified it with uranium oxide he also isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating uranium tetrachloride with potassium 18 the atomic mass of uranium was then calculated as 120 but dmitri mendeleev in 1872 corrected it to 240 using his periodicity laws this value was confirmed experimentally in 1882 by k zimmerman 19 20 thorium oxide was discovered by friedrich wöhler in the mineral which was found in norway  1827 21 jöns jacob berzelius characterized this material in more detail by in 1828 by reduction of thorium tetrachloride with potassium he isolated the metal and named it thorium after the norse god of thunder and lightning thor 22 23 the same isolation method was later used by péligot for uranium 6 actinium was discovered in 1899 by andré-louis debierne an assistant of marie curie in the pitchblende waste left after removal of radium and polonium he described the substance in 1899 as similar to titanium 24 and in 1900 as similar to thorium 25 the discovery of actinium by debierne was however questioned in 1971 26 and 2000 27 arguing that debiernes publications in 1904 contradicted his earlier work of 1899–1900 the name actinium comes from the greek aktis aktinos ακτίς ακτίνος meaning beam or ray this metal was discovered not by its own radiation but by the radiation of the daughter products 28 29 owing to the close similarity of actinium and lanthanum and low abundance pure actinium could only be produced in 1950 the term actinide was probably introduced by victor goldschmidt in 1937 30 31 protactinium was possibly isolated in 1900 by william crookes 32 it was first identified in 1913 when kasimir fajans and oswald helmuth göhring encountered the short-lived isotope 234mpa half-life 1.17 minutes during their studies of the 238u decay they named the new element brevium from latin brevis meaning brief 33 34 the name was changed to protoactinium from greek πρῶτος  ἀκτίς meaning first beam element in 1918 when two groups of scientists led by the austrian lise meitner and otto hahn of germany and frederick soddy and john cranston of great britain independently discovered 231pa the name was shortened to protactinium in 1949 this element was little characterized until 1960 when a g maddock and his co-workers in the uk produced 130grams of protactinium from 60 tonnes of waste left after extraction of uranium from its ore 35 neptunium and aboveedit neptunium named for the planet neptune the next planet out from uranus after which uranium was named was discovered by edwin mcmillan and philip h abelson in 1940 in berkeley california 36 they produced the 239np isotope half-life  2.4 days by bombarding uranium with slow neutrons 35 it was the first transuranium element produced synthetically 37 transuranium elements do not occur in sizeable quantities in nature and are commonly synthesized via nuclear reactions conducted with nuclear reactors for example under irradiation with reactor neutrons uranium-238 partially converts to plutonium-239 in this way enrico fermi with collaborators using the first nuclear reactor chicago pile-1 obtained significant amounts of plutonium-239 which were then used in nuclear weapons 38 actinides with the highest mass numbers are synthesized by bombarding uranium plutonium curium and californium with ions of nitrogen oxygen carbon neon or boron in a particle accelerator so nobelium was produced by bombarding uranium-238 with neon-22 as the first isotopes of transplutonium elements americium-241 and curium-242 were synthesized in 1944 by glenn t seaborg ralph a james and albert ghiorso 39 curium-242 was obtained by bombarding plutonium-239 with 32-mev α-particles the americium-241 and curium-242 isotopes also were produced by irradiating plutonium in a nuclear reactor the latter element was named after marie curie and her husband pierre who are noted for discovering radium and for their work in radioactivity 40 bombarding curium-242 with α-particles resulted in an isotope of californium 245cf  1950 and a similar procedure yielded in 1949 berkelium-243 from americium-241 41 the new elements were named after berkeley california by analogy with its lanthanide homologue terbium which was named after the village of ytterby in sweden 42 in 1945 b b cunningham obtained the first bulk chemical compound of a transplutonium element namely americium hydroxide 43 over the next three to four years milligram quantities of americium and microgram amounts of curium were accumulated that allowed production of isotopes of berkelium thomson 1949 44 45 and californium thomson 1950 46 47 48 sizeable amounts of these elements were produced only in 1958 burris b cunningham and stanley g thomson 49 and the first californium compound  0.3µg of cfocl was obtained only in 1960 by b b cunningham and j c wallmann 50 einsteinium and fermium were identified in 1952–1953 in the fallout from the ivy mike nuclear test  1 november 1952 the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb instantaneous exposure of uranium-238 to a large neutron flux resulting from the explosion produced heavy isotopes of uranium including uranium-253 and uranium-255 and their β-decay yielded einsteinium-253 and fermium-255 the discovery of the new elements and the new data on neutron capture were initially kept secret on the orders of the usmilitary until 1955 due to cold war tensions 7 51 nevertheless the berkeley team were able to prepare einsteinium and fermium by civilian means through the neutron bombardment of plutonium-239 and published this work in 1954 with the disclaimer that it was not the first studies that had been carried out on the elements 52 53 the ivy mike studies were declassified and published in 1955 51 the first significant submicrograms amounts of einsteinium were produced in 1961 by cunningham and colleagues but this has not been done for fermium yet 54 the first isotope of mendelevium 256md half-life 87 min was synthesized by albert ghiorso glenn t seaborg gregory r choppin bernard g harvey and stanley g thompson when they bombarded an 253es target with alpha particles in the 60-inch cyclotron of berkeley radiation laboratory this was the first isotope of any element to be synthesized one atom at a time 55 there were several attempts to obtain isotopes of nobelium by swedish  1957 and american  1958 groups but the first reliable result was the synthesis of 256no by the russian group georgy flyorov et al in 1965 as acknowledged by the iupac in 1992 in their experiments flyorov et al bombarded uranium-238 with neon-22 8 in 1961 ghiorso et al obtained the first isotope of lawrencium by irradiating californium mostly californium-252 with boron-10 and boron-11 ions 8 the mass number of this isotope was not clearly established possibly 258 or 259 at the time in 1965 256lr was synthesized by flyorov et al from 243am and 18o thus iupac recognized the nuclear physics teams at dubna and berkeley as the co-discoverers of lawrencium isotopesedit thirty-one isotopes of actinium and eight excited isomeric states of some of its nuclides were identified by 2010 56 three isotopes 225ac 227ac and 228ac were found in nature and the others were produced in the laboratory only the three natural isotopes are used in applications actinium-225 is a member of radioactive neptunium series 60 it was first discovered in 1947 as a decay product of uranium-233 it is an α-emitter with a half-life of 10 days actinium-225 is less available than actinium-228 but is more promising in radiotracer applications 29 actinium-227 half-life 21.77 years occurs in all uranium ores but in small quantities one gram of uranium in radioactive equilibrium contains only 2×10−10 gram of 227ac 29 56 actinium-228 is a member of radioactive thorium series formed by the decay of 228ra 60 it is a β emitter with a half-life of 6.15 hours in one tonne of thorium there is 5×10−8 gram of 228ac it was discovered by otto hahn in 1906 29 twenty nine isotopes of protactinium are known with mass numbers 212–240 56 as well as three excited isomeric states only 231pa and 234pa have been found in nature all the isotopes have short lifetime except for protactinium-231 half-life 32,760 years the most important isotopes are 231pa and 233pa which is an intermediate product in obtaining uranium-233 and is the most affordable among artificial isotopes of protactinium 233pa has convenient half-life and energy of γ-radiation and thus was used in most studies of protactinium chemistry protactinium-233 is a β-emitter with a half-life of 26.97 days 56 61 uranium has the highest number  25 of both natural and synthetic isotopes they have mass numbers of 217–242 57 and three of them 234u 235u and 238u are present in appreciable quantities in nature among others the most important is 233u which is a final product of transformations of 232th irradiated by slow neutrons 233u has a much higher fission efficiency by low-energy thermal neutrons compared eg with 235u most uranium chemistry studies were carried out on uranium-238 owing to its long half-life of 4.4×109 years 62 there are 19 isotopes of neptunium with mass numbers from 225 to 244 57 they are all highly radioactive the most popular among scientists are long-lived 237np t1/2  2.20×106 years and short-lived 239np 238np t1/2  2 days 37 sixteen isotopes of americium are known with mass numbers from 232 to 248 57 the most important are 241am and 243am which are alpha-emitters and also emit soft but intense γ-rays both of them can be obtained in an isotopically pure form chemical properties of americium were first studied with 241am but later shifted to 243am which is almost 20 times less radioactive the disadvantage of 243am is production of the short-lived daughter isotope 239np which has to be considered in the data analysis 63 among 19 isotopes of curium 57 the most accessible are 242cm and 244cm they are α-emitters but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes these isotopes emit almost no γ-radiation but undergo spontaneous fission with the associated emission of neutrons more long-lived isotopes of curium  245–248cm all α-emitters are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium upon short irradiation this mixture is dominated by curium-246 and then curium-248 begins to accumulate both of these isotopes especially 248cm have a longer half-life  3.48×105 years and are much more convenient for carrying out chemical research than 242cm and 244cm but they also have a rather high rate of spontaneous fission 247cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium  1.56×107 years but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons fourteen isotopes of berkelium were identified with mass numbers 238–252 57 only 249bk is available in large quantities it has a relatively short half-life of 330 days and emits mostly soft β-particles which are inconvenient for detection its alpha radiation is rather weak  1.45×10−3 with respect to β-radiation but is sometimes used to detect this isotope 247bk is an alpha-emitter with a long half-life of 1,380 years but it is hard to obtain in appreciable quantities it is not formed upon neutron irradiation of plutonium because of the β-stability of isotopes of curium isotopes with mass number below 248 63 isotopes of californium with mass numbers 237–256 are formed in nuclear reactors 57 californium-253 is a β-emitter and the rest are α-emitters the isotopes with even mass numbers  250cf 252cf and 254cf have a high rate of spontaneous fission especially 254cf of which 99.7 decays by spontaneous fission californium-249 has a relatively long half-life  352 years weak spontaneous fission and strong γ-emission that facilitates its identification 249cf is not formed in large quantities in a nuclear reactor because of the slow β-decay of the parent isotope 249bk and a large cross section of interaction with neutrons but it can be accumulated in the isotopically pure form as the β-decay product of pre-selected 249bk californium produced by reactor-irradiation of plutonium mostly consists of 250cf and 252cf the latter being predominant for large neutron fluences and its study is hindered by the strong neutron radiation 64 among the 16 known isotopes of einsteinium with mass numbers from 241 to 257 57 the most affordable is 253es it is an α-emitter with a half-life of 20.47 days a relatively weak γ-emission and small spontaneous fission rate as compared with the isotopes of californium prolonged neutron irradiation also produces a long-lived isotope 254es t1/2  275.5 days 64 nineteen isotopes of fermium are known with mass numbers of 242–260 254fm 255fm and 256fm are α-emitters with a short half-life hours which can be isolated in significant amounts 257fm t1/2  100 days can accumulate upon prolonged and strong irradiation all these isotopes are characterized by high rates of spontaneous fission 64 66 among the 15 known isotopes of mendelevium mass numbers from 245 to 260 57 the most studied is 256md which mainly decays through the electron capture α-radiation is ≈10 with the half-life of 77 minutes another alpha emitter 258md has a half-life of 53 days both these isotopes are produced from rare einsteinium  253es and 255es respectively that therefore limits their availability 56 long-lived isotopes of nobelium and isotopes of lawrencium and of heavier elements have relatively short half-lives for nobelium 11 isotopes are known with mass numbers 250–260 and 262 the chemical properties of nobelium and lawrencium were studied with 255no t1/2  3 min and 256lr t1/2  35 s the longest-lived nobelium isotope 259no has a half-life of 1.5 hours 56 among all of these the only isotopes that occur in sufficient quantities in nature to be detected in anything more than traces and have a measurable contribution to the atomic weights of the actinides are the primordial 232th 235u and 238u and three long-lived decay products of natural uranium 230th 231pa and 234u natural thorium consists of 0.02 2 230th and 99.98 2 232th natural protactinium consists of 100 231pa and natural uranium consists of 0.0054 5 234u 0.7204 6 235u and 99.2742 10 238u 67 distribution in natureedit thorium and uranium are the most abundant actinides in nature with the respective mass concentrations of 1.6×10−3 and 4×10−4 68 uranium mostly occurs in the earths crust as a mixture of its oxides in the minerals uraninite which is also called pitchblende because of its black color there are several dozens of other uranium minerals such as carnotite kuo2vo4·3h2o and autunite cauo2 2po4 2nh2o the isotopic composition of natural uranium is 238u relative abundance 99.2742 235u  0.7204 and 234u  0.0054 of these 238u has the largest half-life of 4.51×109 years 69 70 the worldwide production of uranium in 2009 amounted to 50,572 tonnes of which 27.3 was mined in kazakhstan other important uranium mining countries are canada  20.1 australia  15.7 namibia  9.1 russia  7.0 and niger  6.4 71 the most abundant thorium minerals are thorianite tho2 thorite thsio4 and monazite thcacepo4 most thorium minerals contain uranium and vice versa and they all have significant fraction of lanthanides rich deposits of thorium minerals are located in the united states  440,000 tonnes australia and india ~300,000 tonnes each and canada ~100,000 tonnes 73 the abundance of actinium in the earths crust is only about 5×10−15 61 actinium is mostly present in uranium-containing but also in other minerals though in much smaller quantities the content of actinium in most natural objects corresponds to the isotopic equilibrium of parent isotope 235u and it is not affected by the weak ac migration 29 protactinium is more abundant  10−12 in the earths crust than actinium it was discovered in the uranium ore in 1913 by fajans and göhring 33 as actinium the distribution of protactinium follows that of 235u 61 the half-life of the longest-lived isotope of neptunium 237np is negligible compared to the age of the earth thus neptunium is present in nature in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes 37 traces of plutonium in uranium minerals were first found in 1942 and the more systematic results on 239pu are summarized in the table no other plutonium isotopes could be detected in those samples the upper limit of abundance of the longest-living isotope of plutonium 244pu is 3×10−20 plutonium could not be detected in samples of lunar soil owing to its scarcity in nature most plutonium is produced synthetically 72 extractionedit owing to the low abundance of actinides their extraction is a complex multistep process fluorides of actinides are usually used because they are insoluble in water and can be easily separated with redox reactions fluorides are reduced with calcium magnesium or barium 74 among the actinides thorium and uranium are the easiest to isolate thorium is extracted mostly from monazite thorium pyrophosphate thp2o7 is reacted with nitric acid and the produced thorium nitrate treated with tributyl phosphate rare-earth impurities are separated by increasing the ph in sulfate solution 74 in another extraction method monazite is decomposed with a 45 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide at 140c mixed metal hydroxides are extracted first filtered at 80c washed with water and dissolved with concentrated hydrochloric acid next the acidic solution is neutralized with hydroxides to ph  5.8 that results in precipitation of thorium hydroxide thoh 4 contaminated with ~3 of rare-earth hydroxides the rest of rare-earth hydroxides remains in solution thorium hydroxide is dissolved in an inorganic acid and then purified from the rare earth elements an efficient method is the dissolution of thorium hydroxide in nitric acid because the resulting solution can be purified by extraction with organic solvents 74 thoh 4  4 hno3  thno3 4  4 h2o metallic thorium is separated from the anhydrous oxide chloride or fluoride by reacting it with calcium in an inert atmosphere 76 tho2  2 ca  2 cao  th sometimes thorium is extracted by electrolysis of a fluoride in a mixture of sodium and potassium chloride at 700–800c in a graphite crucible highly pure thorium can be extracted from its iodide with the crystal bar process 77 uranium is extracted from its ores in various ways in one method the ore is burned and then reacted with nitric acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state treating the solution with a solution of tributyl phosphate tbp in kerosene transforms uranium into an organic form uo2no3 2tbp 2 the insoluble impurities are filtered and the uranium is extracted by reaction with hydroxides as nh4 2u2o7 or with hydrogen peroxide as uo4·2h2o 74 when the uranium ore is rich in such minerals as dolomite magnesite etc those minerals consume much acid in this case the carbonate method is used for uranium extraction its main component is an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate which converts uranium into a complex uo2co3 3 4 which is stable in aqueous solutions at low concentrations of hydroxide ions the advantages of the sodium carbonate method are that the chemicals have low corrosivity compared to nitrates and that most non-uranium metals precipitate from the solution the disadvantage is that tetravalent uranium compounds precipitate as well therefore the uranium ore is treated with sodium carbonate at elevated temperature and under oxygen pressure this equation suggests that the best solvent for the uranium carbonate processing is a mixture of carbonate with bicarbonate at high ph this results in precipitation of diuranate which is treated with hydrogen in the presence of nickel yielding an insoluble uranium tetracarbonate 74 another separation method uses polymeric resins as a polyelectrolyte ion exchange processes in the resins result in separation of uranium uranium from resins is washed with a solution of ammonium nitrate or nitric acid that yields uranyl nitrate uo2no3 2·6h2o when heated it turns into uo3 which is converted to uo2 with hydrogen reacting uranium dioxide with fluoric acid changes it to uranium tetrafluoride which yields uranium metal upon reaction with magnesium metal 76 to extract plutonium neutron-irradiated uranium is dissolved in nitric acid and a reducing agent feso4 or h2o2 is added to the resulting solution this addition changes the oxidation state of plutonium from +6 to +4 while uranium remains in the form of uranyl nitrate uo2no3 2 the solution is treated with a reducing agent and neutralized with ammonium carbonate to ph  8 that results in precipitation of pu4 compounds 74 in another method pu4 and uo2 2 are first extracted with tributyl phosphate then reacted with hydrazine washing out the recovered plutonium 74 the major difficulty in separation of actinium is the similarity of its properties with those of lanthanum thus actinium is either synthesized in nuclear reactions from isotopes of radium or separated using ion-exchange procedures 29 propertiesedit actinides have similar properties to lanthanides the 6d and 7s electronic shells are filled in actinium and thorium and the 5f shell is being filled with further increase in atomic number the 4f shell is filled in the lanthanides the first experimental evidence for the filling of the 5f shell in actinides was obtained by mcmillan and abelson in 1940 78 as in lanthanides see lanthanide contraction the ionic radius of actinides monotonically decreases with atomic number see also aufbau principle 79 physical propertiesedit actinides are typical metals all of them are soft and have a silvery color but tarnish in air 85 relatively high density and plasticity some of them can be cut with a knife their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µohmcm 80 the hardness of thorium is similar to that of soft steel so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium but is harder than either of them all actinides are radioactive paramagnetic and with the exception of actinium have several crystalline phases plutonium has seven and uranium neptunium and californium three the crystal structures of protactinium uranium neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals 70 all actinides are pyrophoric especially when finely divided that is they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air 85 the melting point of actinides does not have a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons the unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium ~640c is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals 70 chemical propertiesedit like the lanthanides all actinides are highly reactive with halogens and chalcogens however the actinides react more easily actinides especially those with a small number of 5f-electrons are prone to hybridization this is explained by the similarity of the electron energies at the 5f 7s and 6d shells most actinides exhibit a larger variety of valence states and the most stable are +6 for uranium +5 for protactinium and neptunium +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other actinides 87 chemically actinium is similar to lanthanum which is explained by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure like lanthanum actinium has oxidation of +3 but it is less reactive and has more pronounced basic properties among other trivalent actinides ac3 is least acidic ie has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions 29 70 thorium is rather active chemically owing to lack of electrons on 6d and 5f orbitals the tetravalent thorium compounds are colorless at ph  3 the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by the cations thh2o 8 4 the th4 ion is relatively large and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95 and 1.14 å as a result thorium salts have a weak tendency to hydrolyse the distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility not only in water but also in polar organic solvents 70 protactinium exhibits two valence states the +5 is stable and the +4 state easily oxidizes to protactiniumv thus tetravalent protactinium in solutions is obtained by the action of strong reducing agents in a hydrogen atmosphere tetravalent protactinium is chemically similar to uraniumiv and thoriumiv fluorides phosphates hypophosphate iodate and phenylarsonates of protactiniumiv are insoluble in water and dilute acids protactinium forms soluble carbonates the hydrolytic properties of pentavalent protactinium are close to those of tantalumv and niobiumv the complex chemical behavior of protactinium is a consequence of the start of the filling of the 5f shell in this element 61 uranium has a valence from 3 to 6 the last being most stable in the hexavalent state uranium is very similar to the group 6 elements many compounds of uraniumiv and uraniumvi are non-stoichiometric ie have variable composition for example the actual chemical formula of uranium dioxide is uo2x where x varies between −0.4 and 0.32 uraniumvi compounds are weak oxidants most of them contain the linear uranyl group uo2 2 between 4 and 6 ligands can be accommodated in an equatorial plane perpendicular to the uranyl group the uranyl group acts as a hard acid and forms stronger complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands npo2 2 and puo2 2 are also the common form of np and pu in the +6 oxidation state uraniumiv compounds exhibit reducing properties eg they are easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen uraniumiii is a very strong reducing agent owing to the presence of d-shell uranium as well as many other actinides forms organometallic compounds such as uiiic5h5 3 and uivc5h5 4 70 88 neptunium has valence states from 3 to 7 which can be simultaneously observed in solutions the most stable state in solution is +5 but the valence +4 is preferred in solid neptunium compounds neptunium metal is very reactive ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of coordination compounds 37 plutonium also exhibits valence states between 3 and 7 inclusive and thus is chemically similar to neptunium and uranium it is highly reactive and quickly forms an oxide film in air plutonium reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures as low as 25–50c it also easily forms halides and intermetallic compounds hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse plutoniumv can enter polymerization reactions 89 90 the largest chemical diversity among actinides is observed in americium which can have valence between 2 and 6 divalent americium is obtained only in dry compounds and non-aqueous solutions acetonitrile oxidation states +3 +5 and +6 are typical for aqueous solutions but also in the solid state tetravalent americium forms stable solid compounds dioxide fluoride and hydroxide as well as complexes in aqueous solutions it was reported that in alkaline solution americium can be oxidized to the heptavalent state but these data proved erroneous the most stable valence of americium is 3 in the aqueous solutions and 3 or 4 in solid compounds 91 valence 3 is dominant in all subsequent elements up to lawrencium with the possible exception of nobelium curium can be tetravalent in solids fluoride dioxide berkelium along with a valence of +3 also shows the valence of +4 more stable than that of curium the valence 4 is observed in solid fluoride and dioxide the stability of bk4 in aqueous solution is close to that of ce4 only valence 3 was observed for californium einsteinium and fermium the divalent state is proven for mendelevium and nobelium and in nobelium it is more stable than the trivalent state lawrencium shows valence 3 both in solutions and solids 91 the redox potential e m 4  ano 2 2  displaystyle ce mathit efrac m{4ano2{2 increases from −0.32 v in uranium through 0.34 v np and 1.04 v pu to 1.34 v in americium revealing the increasing reduction ability of the an4 ion from americium to uranium all actinides form anh3 hydrides of black color with salt-like properties actinides also produce carbides with the general formula of anc or anc2 u2c3 for uranium as well as sulfides an2s3 and ans2 87 uranyl nitrate uo2no3 2 aqueous solutions of uranium

hexafluoride u3o8 yellowcake compoundsedit oxides and hydroxidesedit some actinides can exists in several oxide forms such as an2o3 ano2 an2o5 and ano3 for all actinides oxides ano3 are amphoteric and an2o3 ano2 and an2o5 are basic they easily react with water forming bases 87 these bases are poorly soluble in water and by their activity are close to the hydroxides of rare-earth metals the strongest base is of actinium all compounds of actinium are colorless except for black actinium sulfide ac2s3 87 dioxides of tetravalent actinides crystallize in the cubic system same as in calcium fluoride thorium reacting with oxygen exclusively forms dioxide thorium dioxide is a refractory material with the highest melting point among any known oxide  3390c 96 adding 0.8–1 tho2 to tungsten stabilizes its structure so the doped filaments have better mechanical stability to vibrations to dissolve tho2 in acids it is heated to 500–600c heating above 600c produces a very resistant to acids and other reagents form of tho2 small addition of fluoride ions catalyses dissolution of thorium dioxide in acids two protactinium oxides were obtained pao2 black and pa2o5white the former is isomorphic with tho2 and the latter is easier to obtain both oxides are basic and paoh 5 is a weak poorly soluble base 87 decomposition of certain salts of uranium for example uo2no3·6h2o in air at 400c yields orange or yellow uo3 96 this oxide is amphoteric and forms several hydroxides the most stable being uo2oh 2 reaction of uraniumvi oxide with hydrogen results in uranium dioxide which is similar in its properties with tho2 this oxide is also basic and corresponds to the uranium hydroxide uoh 4 87 plutonium neptunium and americium form two basic oxides an2o3 and ano2 neptunium trioxide is unstable thus only np3o8 could be obtained so far however the oxides of plutonium and neptunium with the chemical formula ano2 and an2o3 are well characterized 87 saltsedit actinides easily react with halogens forming salts with the formulas mx3 and mx4 x  halogen so the first berkelium compound bkcl3 was synthesized in 1962 with an amount of 3 nanograms like the halogens of rare earth elements actinide chlorides bromides and iodides are water-soluble and fluorides are insoluble uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5c because of its volatility it is used in the separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides they are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming ano2f2 101 the pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized but they are both unstable 87 action of acids on actinides yields salts and if the acids are non-oxidizing then the actinide in the salt is in low-valence state however in these reactions the regenerating hydrogen can react with the metal forming the corresponding hydride uranium reacts with acids and water much more easily than thorium 87 actinide salts can also be obtained by dissolving the corresponding hydroxides in acids nitrates chlorides sulfates and perchlorates of actinides are water-soluble when crystallizing from aqueous solutions these salts forming a hydrates such as thno3 4·6h2o thso4 2·9h2o and pu2so4 3·7h2o salts of high-valence actinides easily hydrolyze so colorless sulfate chloride perchlorate and nitrate of thorium transform into basic salts with formulas thoh 2so4 and thoh 3no3 the solubility and insolubility of trivalent and tetravalent actinides is like that of lanthanide salts so phosphates fluorides oxalates iodates and carbonates of actinides are weakly soluble in water they precipitate as hydrates such as thf4·3h2o and thcro4 2·3h2o 87 actinides with oxidation state +6 except for the ano22-type cations form ano4 2 an2o7 2 and other complex anions for example uranium neptunium and plutonium form salts of the na2uo4 uranate and nh4 2u2o7 diuranate types in comparison with lanthanides actinides more easily form coordination compounds and this ability increases with the actinide valence trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds whereas tetravalent thorium forms k2thf6 kthf5 and even k5thf9 complexes thorium also forms the corresponding sulfates for example na2so4th so4 2·5h2o nitrates and thiocyanates salts with the general formula an2thno3 6nh2o are of coordination nature with the coordination number of thorium equal to 12 even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and hexavalent actinides the most stable coordination compounds of actinides  tetravalent thorium and uranium  are obtained in reactions with diketones eg acetylacetone 87 applicationsedit while actinides have some established daily-life applications such as in smoke detectors americium 102 103 and gas mantles thorium 76 they are mostly used in nuclear weapons and use as a fuel in nuclear reactors 76 the last two areas exploit the property of actinides to release enormous energy in nuclear reactions which under certain conditions may become self-sustaining chain reaction the most important isotope for nuclear power applications is uranium-235 it is used in the thermal reactor and its concentration in natural uranium does not exceed 0.72 this isotope strongly absorbs thermal neutrons releasing much energy one fission act of 1gram of 235u converts into about 1 mwday of importance is that 235u emits more neutrons than it absorbs 104 upon reaching the critical mass 235u enters into a self-sustaining chain reaction 70 typically uranium nucleus is divided into two fragments with the release of 2–3 neutrons for example other promising actinide isotopes for nuclear power are thorium-232 and its product from the thorium fuel cycle uranium-233 fast neutrons are slowed by moderators which contain water carbon deuterium or beryllium as thermal neutrons to increase the efficiency of their interaction with uranium-235 the rate of nuclear reaction is controlled by introducing additional rods made of boron or cadmium or a liquid absorbent usually boric acid reactors for plutonium production are called breeder reactor or breeders they have a different design and use fast neutrons emission of neutrons during the fission of uranium is important not only for maintaining the nuclear chain reaction but also for the synthesis of the heavier actinides uranium-239 converts via β-decay into plutonium-239 which like uranium-235 is capable of spontaneous fission the worlds first nuclear reactors were built not for energy but for producing plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons about half of the produced thorium is used as the light-emitting material of gas mantles 76 thorium is also added into multicomponent alloys of magnesium and zinc so the mg-th alloys are light and strong but also have high melting point and ductility and thus are widely used in the aviation industry and in the production of missiles thorium also has good electron emission properties with long lifetime and low potential barrier for the emission 104 the relative content of thorium and uranium isotopes is widely used to estimate the age of various objects including stars see radiometric dating 107 the major application of plutonium has been in nuclear weapons where the isotope plutonium-239 was a key component due to its ease of fission and availability plutonium-based designs allow reducing the critical mass to about a third of that for uranium-235 108 the fat man-type plutonium bombs produced during the manhattan project used explosive compression of plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal combined with a central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency thus only 6.2kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of tnt 109 see also nuclear weapon design hypothetically as little as 4kg of plutoniumand maybe even lesscould be used to make a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs 110 plutonium-238 is potentially more efficient isotope for nuclear reactors since it has smaller critical mass than uranium-235 but it continues to release much thermal energy  0.56 wg 103 111 by decay even when the fission chain reaction is stopped by control rods its application is limited by the high price about 1000 usdg this isotope has been used in thermopiles and water distillation systems of some space satellites and stations so galileo and apollo spacecraft eg apollo 14 112 had heaters powered by kilogram quantities of plutonium-238 oxide this heat is also transformed into electricity with thermopiles the decay of plutonium-238 produces relatively harmless alpha particles and is not accompanied by gamma-irradiation therefore this isotope ~160mg is used as the energy source in heart pacemakers where it lasts about 5 times longer than conventional batteries 103 actinium-227 is used as a neutron source its high specific energy  14.5 wg and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are attractive for use in long-lasting thermoelectric generators for remote use 228ac is used as an indicator of radioactivity in chemical research as it emits high-energy electrons  2.18 mev that can be easily detected 228ac-228ra mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma-source in industry and medicine 29 development of self-glowing actinide-doped materials with durable crystalline matrices is a new area of actinide utilization as the addition of alpha-emitting radionuclides to some glasses and crystals may confer luminescence 113 toxicityedit radioactive substances can harm human health via i local skin contamination ii internal exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes and iii external overexposure by β-activity and γ-radiation together with radium and transuranium elements actinium is one of the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific α-activity the most important feature of actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain in the surface layer of skeletons at the initial stage of poisoning actinium accumulates in the liver another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller ~0.05 for actinium than radium 29 protactinium in the body tends to accumulate in the kidneys and bones the maximum safe dose of protactinium in the human body is 0.03 µci that corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of 231pa this isotope which might be present in the air as aerosol is 2.5×108 times more toxic than hydrocyanic acid 61contradictory plutonium when entering the body through air food or blood eg a wound mostly settles in the lungs liver and bones with only about 10 going to other organs and remains there for decades the long residence time of plutonium in the body is partly explained by its poor solubility in water some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation which damages the surrounding cells the median lethal dose ld50 for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µci such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope after trials on animals this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µci studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation after which 5–25 of inhaled substances is retained in the body depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones contamination via food is the least likely way in this case only about 0.05 of soluble 0.01 insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood and the rest is excreted exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100 of it 89 using actinides in nuclear fuel sealed radioactive sources or advanced materials such as self-glowing crystals has many potential benefits however a serious concern is the extremely high radiotoxicity of actinides and their migration in the environment 114 use of chemically unstable forms of actinides in mox and sealed radioactive sources is not appropriate by modern safety standards there is a challenge to develop stable and durable actinide-bearing materials which provide safe storage use and final disposal a key need is application of actinide solid solutions in durable crystalline host phases 113 see alsoedit actinides in the environment major actinides minor actinides
