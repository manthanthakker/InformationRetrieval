How did you plot graphs?

1. During evaluation phase, p@k for all  1:100 were stored and average precision and recall were stored in a file called 'plot.txt'

2. Applied Interpolation formula and plotted via scatter plot in excel 

3. Finally to compare performance of each search engine, merged all the graphs.

CHALLENGES?

1. The graphs were pretty close. Had to select colors that were easily visible. 

2. To avoid the overhead of using XLPOI or Jexcel API's, manually converted the 7 search engines file and merged it. 
Reason : Wanted some experience in excel, so decided to do the manual way.

PROS :

1. ACHIEVED a clear and neat graph, with a good color representation.

2. Learned Excel plotting graphs

3. Learned how to apply formuals in excel.
