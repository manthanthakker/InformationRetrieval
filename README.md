# InformationRetrieval
⇨ Designed and implemented a search engine architecture from scratch for CACM and a sample Wikipedia corpus. ⇨  Crawled the corpus, parsed and indexed the raw documents using simple word count program using Map Reduce, performed ranking using the standard Page Rank algorithm and retrieved the relevant pages using variations of four distinct IR approaches, BM25, TF-IDF, cosine similarity and Lucene based IR model. ⇨  Conducted a comparative study to evaluate the performance of the different search engines. ⇨ Technologies used: Lucene, NetBeans, JSoup, Weka, MapReduce
